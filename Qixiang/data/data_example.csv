3D5HUXSL,Preliminary indoor evidences of microplastic effects on freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates,"Plastics are to date considered one of the main detrimental drivers for the health of aquatic ecosystems, both in marine and inland waters. Regarding the latter habitat, it seems surprising how the plastic effects on benthic invertebrates are neglected since macroinvertebrates have a long tradition in the water quality assessment activities. In this context, we propose timely indoor observations on the exposure of caddisfly Odontocerum albicorne and mayfly Ephemera danica to various microplastic polymers (ABS, PET, PP, PS, PVDF). Three different experimental designs were performed on caddisflies and mayflies by exposing their larvae to natural and microplastic substrates. Our findings highlighted how microplastics affected both caddisflies in rebuilding its own case (after having removed the natural one) and mayflies burrowing. Particularly, all caddisflies rebuilt cases using the microplastic polymers provided instead of natural items only. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that mayflies burrow mainly in microplastic substrates rather than in natural ones. Our research highlights that macroinvertebrate larvae would use naturally occurring microplastics and this could be of particular concern in freshwaters with high contamination by plastics. Indeed, larvae appear to not necessarily perceive microplastics as a direct stressor. Further studies ought to be conducted to understand the chronic perturbation on larvae fitness and for example, on drift behaviour. Also, further investigations are needed to understand the potentialities of using plastics by benthic macroinvertebrates. ?? 2021, The Author(s).",0
KE2NTCS7,The effect of natural fillers on the marine biodegradation behaviour of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV),"Worldwide, improper disposal of plastics is instigating environmental initiatives to combat plastics accumulation of in the environment and the world?????s oceans. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) biocomposites with Miscanthus (Misc) fibres and distillers????? dried grains with solubles (DDGS) were studied to ascertain if natural fibres and proteinaceous fillers can improve polyhydroxyalkanoate marine biodegradability. Using ASTM standard D7991-15, the biodegradation of PHBV, PHBV with Misc (15 and 25 wt%) and PHBV with DDGS (15 and 25 wt%) was performed in a simulated marine environment for the first time, as indicated by a literature survey. PHBV/Misc (85/15) and (75/25) biocomposites showed 15 and 25% more biodegradation compared to PHBV, respectively. Proteinaceous PHBV/DDGS (85/15) and (75/25) biocomposites showed 17 and 40% more biodegradation compared to PHBV, respectively. Furthermore, PHBV/Misc (75/25) and PHBV/DDGS (75/25) biocomposites were marine biodegraded in 412 and 295 days, respectively. In conclusion, proteinaceous fillers (DDGS) biocomposites have better marine biodegradability than miscanthus. ?? 2021, The Author(s).",0
BELAGTQW,Effects of intermittent loading time and stress ratio on dwell fatigue behavior of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V ELI used in deep-sea submersibles,"Different components of deep-sea submersibles, such as the pressure hull, are usually subjected to intermittent loading, dwell loading, and unloading during service. Therefore, for the design and reliability assessment of structural parts under dwell fatigue loading, understanding the effects of intermittent loading time on dwell fatigue behavior of the alloys is essential. In this study, the effects of the intermittent loading time and stress ratio on dwell fatigue behavior of the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4 V ELI were investigated. Results suggest that the dwell fatigue failure modes of Ti-6Al-4 V ELI can be classified into three types, i.e., fatigue failure mode, ductile failure mode, and mixed failure mode. The intermittent loading time does not affect the dwell fatigue behavior, whereas the stress ratio significantly affects the dwell fatigue life and dwell fatigue mechanism. The dwell fatigue life increases with an increase in the stress ratio for the same maximum stress, and specimens with a negative stress ratio tend to undergo ductile failure. The mechanism of dwell fatigue of titanium alloys is attribute to an increase in the plastic strain caused by the part of the dwell loading, thereby resulting in an increase in the actual stress of the specimens during the subsequent loading cycles and aiding the growth of the formed crack or damage, along with the local plastic strain or damage induced by the part of the fatigue load promoting the cumulative plastic strain during the dwell fatigue process. The interaction between dwell loading and fatigue loading accelerates specimen failure, in contrast to the case for individual creep or fatigue loading alone. The dwell fatigue life and cumulative maximum strain during the first loading cycle could be correlated by a linear relationship on the log?????log scale. This relationship can be used to evaluate the dwell fatigue life of Ti alloys with the maximum stress dwell. ?? 2020",0
JMPMKT8S,Factors influencing the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in coastal sediments: From source to sink,"Microplastic (MP) pollution is attracting growing global attention, but little is known about the factors influencing MP occurrence and distributions in marine sediments. Here, MPs were sampled from the sediments of two semi-enclosed bays (Jinghai Bay and Laizhou Bay) and two coastal open zones (Lancelet Reserve and Solen grandis Reserve) in China. The order of MP abundance was Jinghai Bay > Laizhou Bay > Lancelet Reserve > Solen grandis Reserve. Average MP diversity indices for Laizhou Bay (1.84 ?? 0.18), Lancelet Reserve (1.59 ?? 0.43), S. grandis Reserve (1.58 ?? 0.89), and Jinghai Bay (1.43 ?? 0.14) revealed Laizhou Bay had the most complicated MP sources. A significant negative correlation between MP abundance and sediment grain size occurred in the semi-enclosed coastal zones (p = 0.004, r = ???0.618) rather than in the open coastal zones (p = 0.051, r = ???0.480), indicating small sediment particles can strongly enhance MP accumulation in semi-enclosed costal sediments. Although anthropogenic activities influence the MP distribution at source, the composition of regional and local sediments might impact MP occurrence in semi-enclosed coastal zones from the sink. These results help to improve our understanding of the fate and inventory of MPs in coastal sediments. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",1
NV3P66HB,"Neglected microplastics pollution in the nearshore surface waters derived from coastal fishery activities in Weihai, China","Plastic fishing gears have been widely used in marine fishing and mariculture, which could cause serious microplastics pollution but receive little attention. To further figure out the effect of fishery activities on microplastics, the occurrence and sources of microplastics contamination in the nearshore surface seawater of Weihai (a coastal fishery city of China) were studied. All the collected microplastics were sorted and counted based on their size, shape, and color. The distribution of microplastics pollution in this study areas was mapped. The results showed that the mean concentration of all sampling sites was 5.9??3.5 particles/m3; the concentration in the mariculture areas was 11.49 particles/m3, much higher than that in other areas without mariculture 1.57 particles/m3. Fragment and fiber accounted for 45.4% and 28.2% of the total microplastics, respectively. Most fibers and fragments were identified as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), mainly originated from the fishing nets/ropes. Polystyrene (PS) was also generally detected in the samples due to the foam floating balls used in the mariculture area. Our research strongly suggested that marine fishery activities, especially for mariculture, could be an underestimated sea-based microplastics source and more attentions should be given. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",1
U8ICGBMY,"Assessing small-scale freshwater microplastics pollution, land-use, source-to-sink conduits, and pollution risks: Perspectives from Japanese rivers polluted with microplastics","Rivers are vital for understanding freshwater microplastics pollution, along with the conduits from land-sources to marine-sinks. In this study, we investigated microplastics in the small-scale Awano and Ayaragi rivers, which flow into the Sea of Japan (SJ), and the Asa and Majime rivers, which flow into the Seto Inland Sea (SIS) in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. Surface water samples were collected from 29 stations. Filtration, wet peroxidation, and density separation methods were employed to extract microplastics. Polymers were identified via attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Microplastics abundances and comparisons among different rivers revealed that these small-scale rivers were highly polluted than others around the world. Characterization demonstrated that small microplastics (<1000 ??m) in size, fibers and fragments in shape and the polymers?????polyethylene, polypropylene, vinylon, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene were dominant. These small-scale rivers emitted substantially higher quantities of Japan land-sourced microplastics (0.4?????154.27 billions/day and 0.01?????17.55 tons/day) into the SJ and SIS environments than larger rivers in other countries compared to basin areas. The pollution load index indicated that all the river stations were polluted with microplastics. An assessment of the polymeric and pollution risks revealed variably low to high risks. The higher were the abundances of microplastics and toxic polymers, the higher were the pollution level and risks. The sites at high risk of pollution were regarded as hotspots. Both point and non-point land-uses sources of pollution could release microplastics into the river freshwater environments, affected posing high risks and hotspots. Moreover, the pollution characteristics (shapes-sizes-colors-polymers) indicated serious ecotoxicological threats to these rivers and their downstream environments. This study provided new insights into river microplastics pollution and revealed small-scale rivers to be prominent source-to-sink microplastics conduits. Risk assessments provided a baseline for future comprehensive assessments and developing practical approaches to wards setting water quality criteria, pollution control and management. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",0
F47I5TSJ,"Recommended best practices for collecting, analyzing, and reporting microplastics in environmental media: Lessons learned from comprehensive monitoring of San Francisco Bay","Microplastics are ubiquitous and persistent contaminants in the ocean and a pervasive and preventable threat to the health of marine ecosystems. Microplastics come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and plastic types, each with unique physical and chemical properties and toxicological impacts. Understanding the magnitude of the microplastic problem and determining the highest priorities for mitigation require accurate measures of microplastic occurrence in the environment and identification of likely sources. The field of microplastic pollution is in its infancy, and there are not yet widely accepted standards for sample collection, laboratory analyses, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), or reporting of microplastics in environmental samples. Based on a comprehensive assessment of microplastics in San Francisco Bay water, sediment, fish, bivalves, stormwater, and wastewater effluent, we developed recommended best practices for collecting, analyzing, and reporting microplastics in environmental media. We recommend factors to consider in microplastic study design, particularly in regard to site selection and sampling methods. We also highlight the need for standard QA/QC practices such as collection of field and laboratory blanks, use of methods beyond microscopy to identify particle composition, and standardized reporting practices, including suggested vocabulary for particle classification. ?? 2021 The Authors",1
ISHRGXSQ,Selection of antibiotic resistance genes on biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics,"Growing evidence have demonstrated that microplastics in the marine ecosystem can provide novel substrates for biofilm formation, potentially facilitating the spread of antibiotic resistance. However, the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the biofilm on microplastics has not been fully explored. This study used the metagenomic data of biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics staged at a coastal lagoon in the northern Gulf of Mexico to profile the ARGs and their bacterial hosts. The abundance and Shannon diversity of ARGs on biodegradable poly hydroxy alkanoate (PHA) and non-biodegradable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) have no significant differences. Nevertheless, the abundance of multidrug resistance genes on PET (3.05 copies per 16S rRNA) was statistically higher than that on PHA (2.05). Beta diversity showed that the overall pattern of resistome on PHA was significantly distinct with that on PET. Procrustes analysis suggested a good-fit correlation between ARG profiles and bacterial community composition. The host-tracking analysis identified that Pseudomonas was always the major host for glycopeptide and multidrug resistance genes in PET and PHA biofilms, whereas the primary host for macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) changed to Desulfovibrio on PET. This study provided the first metagenomic insights into the ARGs and their hosts on biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics, suggesting that both two types of plastics harbor ARGs with preferences. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
QXA7D4HT,You are what you eat: Microplastics in the feces of young men living in Beijing,"Purpose: Microplastics have been widely detected in the environment and marine organisms. However, few studies have investigated the presence of microplastics in humans. This preliminary study identified and quantified the microplastic content in human feces. Methods: A total of 26 young male students aged 18?????25 years were recruited from Beijing, China. A self-administered 7-day 24-h fluid intake record was used to document fluid intake, and food intake was recorded for 3 days. Feces were collected by participants using a sterile fecal collector. Microplastics in the remaining fecal residues were measured and identified using fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy. Results: Eventually, twenty-four participants completed the study. The fecal samples of 23 (95.8%) participants tested positive for microplastics. In these 23 samples, the abundance of microplastics varied from 1 particle/g to 36 particles/g (size 20 to 800 ??m). The summed mass of all microplastic particles per participant ranged from 0.01 to 14.6 mg. Qualitative analysis of the microplastics indicated the presence of one to eight types of microplastics in each sample, with polypropylene (PP) being the most abundant; it was found in 95.8% of fecal samples. We examined associations between water intake habits and the abundance of microplastics in their feces. A moderate correlation was observed between packaged water and beverage intake and microplastic abundance in feces (r = 0.445, P = 0.029). Conclusion: Various types of microplastics were detected in human feces, with PP being found in the highest proportion. There may be an association between water intake habits and microplastic abundance in feces. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
RVA3A2QG,"Microplastics in seafood as an emerging threat to marine environment: A case study in Goa, west coast of India","The present study exhibits the occurrence of MPs in different matrices (water, sediment and biota) from the Sal estuary, Goa, situated on the central west coast of India. The average numbers of MPs in the water column and sediment were 48 ?? 19 MP particles/L (MPs/L) and 3950 ?? 930 MP particles/kg (MPs/kg), respectively. In shellfish (whole soft tissue), the average concentrations of MPs were 4 ?? 2 (Crassostrea sp.), 3.2 ?? 1.8 (Perna viridis) and 0.7 ?? 0.3 (Paphia malbarica) MPs/g body weight (bw), respectively. The highest MPs were recorded in finfish (gastro-intestinal tract) (Mugil cephalus)7.8 ?? 4, followed by (Gerres filamentosus) 5.3 ?? 4.9, (Arius jella) 4.6 ?? 2.6, and (Etroplus suratensis)1.4 ?? 0.3 MP/g bw. MP fibres were predominant in all matrices. Interestingly, a dominance of small sized (10?????300 ??m) MPs was recorded in biota. Among the 37 polymer types identified by ??-FTIR, the most prevalent ones were, polyacrylamide (PAM), polyacetylene, ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyamide (nylon). Notably, the polymers dominant in the gut of finfish and in whole shellfish were equally prominent in sediment and the water column. This study highlights the presence of MPs in commercially important shellfish and finfish samples from the Sal estuary. This study clearly shows the presence of MPs in various types of marine organisms in the Sal estuary. As shellfish is locally consumed as a delicacy and plays a major role in the seafood industry, the MPs may pose a hazard for human health. There is also an ecological risk as MPs are also found in water and sediment and in the digestive tract of finfish. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
85WBN3ZI,Microplastics in different tissues of wild crabs at three important fishing grounds in China,"Crabs are an indispensable component of the benthic ecosystem and represent a type of seafood that is easily obtained and frequently eaten by humans. However, little is known about microplastic (MP) accumulation in different tissues of crabs in important fishing areas. In this study, the abundances and characteristics of MPs in different tissues of four species of wild crabs (Portunus trituberculatus, Charybdis japonica, Dorippe japonica, and Matuta planipes) were investigated across 9 sites at three important fishing grounds (Haizhou Bay, Lvsi and Yangtze River Estuary fishing grounds) in China. Crabs from all sites were found to contain MPs, with a total detection rate of 89.34%. The MP abundance in crabs from all sites ranged from 2.00 ?? 2.00 to 9.81 ?? 8.08 items/individual and 0.80 ?? 1.09 to 22.71 ?? 24.56 items/g wet weight. The abundance of MPs exponentially increased with decreasing MP size. The MPs were dominated by fibers in terms of shape, black-gray and blue-green in terms of color and cellophane in terms of composition. MPs were found in the gills and guts of the crabs, but not in the muscles. The abundance and size of the MPs in the guts were significantly higher than those in the gills, but there was no significant difference in color or shape. In addition, crab eating patterns have a significant impact on the abundance of MPs in different species. The abundance of MPs in the saprophytic crabs was significantly higher than that in the predatory crabs. MP contamination in crabs is worthy of attention for human health and the stability of marine ecosystems. ?? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",0
J9QPQ7ED,"Comparative life cycle assessment of system solution scenarios for residual municipal solid waste management in NSW, Australia","Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a promising tool to evaluate the environmental impacts of different technologies for sustainable waste management. This study employs LCA to assess environmental impacts of alternative scenarios for residual municipal solid waste (MSW) management in New South Wales (NSW) based on current conditions and policies. Six different scenarios including a baseline scenario (landfilling) were applied for NSW waste management for energy production and their impacts on environment. The initial results showed that the scenario 3 that employed anaerobic digestion for food waste, incineration for combustible waste and plastic waste, and landfilling for non-combustible waste produced electricity of 625 kWh/t, which was maximum compared to the other scenarios. LCA results further suggested that among all scenarios, scenario 5 (similar to scenario 3 except combustible waste was treated through gasification and plastic waste was recycled) has the lowest level of environmental burdens in global warming, freshwater and marine ecotoxicity, and human non-carcinogenic toxicity. The sensitivity analysis for energy conversion rates (23?????30%) for incineration and plastic recycling rate (66?????91.3%) for MSW was further conducted and the results showed that energy conversion rate of 30% makes scenario 3 more valuable for electricity generation and less impactful for ecosystems damage category compared to scenario 5. On the other hand, plastic recycling rate of 91.3% has the lowest environmental burdens and by decreasing recycling rate to 66% the environmental impacts increase; however, it was noticed that reduction in recycling rate does not make any change in the order of scenarios. Overall, the study suggests that each waste type in NSW should be treated with a specific technology to achieve the highest resource recovery and lowest environmental impacts where energy conversion and plastic recycling rates have significant impacts. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
CC6XHSPG,Low surface energy self-polishing polymer grafted MWNTs for antibacterial coating and controlled-release property of Cu2O,"Marine biofouling had been a headache when engaging in marine activities. The most effective and convenient method for dealing with this problem was to apply antifouling coatings. But now a single anti-fouling system was hard to satisfy the requirement of anti-fouling simultaneously. Therefore, it was particularly important to develop novel multi-system anti-fouling technology. In the work, a novel polymer coatings with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) segments in the main chain and hydrolysable side chain was designed and synthesized which showed low surface energy and self-polishing performance, and then we creatively covalently immobilized the polyurethane on the surface of multi-carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to form multisystem antifouling coating. The results showed that the polymer coating would produce hydrolysable regions in the hydrophobic PDMS segment to endure the polymer coating hydrophobic and hydrolysis properties when contacted with water. In addition, the self-polishing rate and the surface energy could be regulated by varying its copolymerization, and the addition of MWNTs could kill the microorganisms and endowed the polymer coating itself enhanced antibacterial effect. Furthermore, considering the high specific surface area and physicochemical characteristics of MWNTs, it could be combined with antifoulant Cu2O through a polar or non-polar combination as a carrier to control the release rate of Cu2O in coatings. ?? 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",0
56B3WSTG,Comparative study of three sampling methods for microplastics analysis in seawater,"Microplastics, as an emerging pollutant, are widely spread in the oceans. The sampling method is the most basic and important factor affecting the reported microplastic abundance data. Three sampling methods, most commonly used for microplastic collection, including direct filtration with 0.45 ??m pore size membrane, 20 ??m sieve pre-concentration followed by 0.45 ??m filtration and Manta trawling with a 150 ??m mesh size net were studied. The results showed that there were orders of magnitude difference in abundance of microplastic across the three methods with 0.45 ??m direct filtration yielding 1600.0?????4000.0 items/m3, 20 ??m sieve pre-concentration yielding 10.0?????50.0 items/m3, and 150 ??m trawl net yielding 0.13?????0.24 items/m3. The polymer types of microplastic collected by the three methods were similar, but polymer proportions were different. PES and rayon dominated in the samples collected by direct filtration and sieve pre-concentration. PES and PP accounted for a higher proportion in the trawling samples. The abundance and polymer types of microplastics had a clear correlation between direct filtration and sieve pre-concentration (p &lt; 0.05). More microplastic shapes were found in trawling samples. The average and median sizes of microplastics increased with increasing pore or mesh size. According to the size fraction and standard deviation of microplastic size in different samples of each method, the stability of method decreased with increasing pore or mesh size. The trawling method had a higher sampling efficiency, but its stability was weaker than the other two methods. Our results suggested that an appropriate method should be selected upon actual sampling condition and available tools during the research process to improve the credibility of the results. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
6QNQ3T5I,Deep seafloor plastics as the source and sink of organic pollutants in the northern South China Sea,"Large plastic litter (as opposed to microplastics and plastic pellets) could adsorb organic pollutants and thus pose a serious threat to the marine environment. We report high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) adsorbed to plastic litter sampled from depths of 1800?????3100 m in the Xisha Trough region of the northern South China Sea (NSCS). ???PCBs on plastics ranged from 126.9?????142.1 ng/g, with tri-PCBs accounting for 92?????97% of the total PCB concentrations in all samples. Levels of ???OCPs varied from 4280 to 5351 ng/g (average 4690 ng/g), with a total of 19 compounds detected in the seven samples. While no parent DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) was detected, op?????-DDE (metabolite of DDT) was most abundant, with concentrations ranging from 947.5?????1551.7 ng/g. ???CHLs (heptachlor + heptachlor epoxide A + heptachlor epoxide B + cis-chlordane + trans-chlordane) ranged from 1083.1?????1263.7 ng/g (mean 1153 ng/g) and accounted for 24% of ???OCPs. Various compositional ratios of HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDT metabolites improved our understanding of the sources and transport pathways of OCPs. The total absence of DDT may be a ?????ghost indicator????? of no recent DDT inputs into the oceans. There could well be inputs of DDT, but only as the degraded metabolites DDE and DDD when they are adsorbed to seafloor plastic litter. A comparison of HCH isomer ratios in seafloor plastics with technical HCH ratios revealed that HCHs were possibly not from early residues but from later inputs. An ecological risk assessment of the contaminants indicated a high risk from ???DDTs, p,p-DDE, and ??-HCH in all the sampled locations. Finally, we propose a descriptive model depicting the movements and transportation of PCBs and OCPs from the ocean surface to seafloor plastics in the NSCS. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
FKPQ2AKB,Insight into the characteristics and sorption behaviors of aged polystyrene microplastics through three type of accelerated oxidation processes,"Ageing process can significantly alter the structural properties, environmental behaviors and potential ecotoxicity of microplastics (MPs) in water. In this study, the structural properties of aged polystyrene (PS) MPs being exposed to UV/H2O, UV/H2O2 and UV/Cl2 artificially accelerated oxidation processes and related sorption behaviors of bisphenol A (BPA) on those virgin/aged PS were investigated. The surface oxidation and hydrophilicity of aged PS were significantly increased according to infrared spectroscopy (IR) and water contact angle (CA) measurements. The differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) revealed apparent degradation of aged PS especially in their amorphous domain. Obviously deteriorative BPA sorption capacity on aged PS was observed compared with that of virgin PS. The sorption rates of BPA on aged PS were accelerated and sorption of BPA shifted from partition dominant mechanism on virgin PS to the adsorption dominant mechanism through being fitted with the dual-mode sorption model. Besides, ageing in UV/Cl2 system introduces C?????Cl groups on the surface of PS which strengthen the combination with BPA through halogen bonding interaction. Salt and dissolved organic matters (DOM) in marine water may increase the BPA sorption on aged MPs due to enhanced polar interaction. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
SQ5YFXQ3,COVID-19 pandemic repercussions on plastic and antiviral polymeric textile causing pollution on beaches and coasts of South America,"The propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide has been alarming in the last months. According to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the use of face masks is essential for slowing down the transmission rate of COVID-19 in human beings. This pandemic has generated a substantial increase in the use, as well as in the production, of face masks and other elements (gloves, face protectors, protective suits, safety shoes) manufactured with polymeric materials, including antiviral textiles most of which will end as microplastic pools. Focusing on South America, the use and mismanagement of this type of personal protective equipment (PPE) represents an environmental problem. Added to this issue are the increase in the use of single-use plastic, and the reduction of plastic recycling due to the curfew generated by the pandemic, further aggravating plastic pollution on coasts and beaches. Recently, researchers have developed antiviral polymeric textile technology composed of Ag and Cu nanoparticles for PPE to reduce the contagion and spread of COVID-19. Antiviral polymeric textile wastes could also have long-term negative repercussions on aquatic environments, as they are an important emerging class of contaminants. For this reason, this work provides reflections and perspectives on how the COVID-19 pandemic can aggravate plastic pollution on beaches and coastal environments, consequently increasing the damage to marine species in the coming years. In addition, the potential impact of the pandemic on waste management systems is discussed here, as well as future research directions to improve integrated coastal management strategies. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
TW5V6G8J,Microplastics decrease the toxicity of triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) in the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) larvae,"Plastics have been recognized as a serious threat to the environment. Besides their own toxicity, microplastics can interact with other environmental pollutants, acting as carriers and potentially modulating their toxicity. In this study, the toxicity of polystyrene (PS) microplastic fragments (plain PS; carboxylated PS, PS-COOH and aminated PS, PS-NH2) and triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) (an emerging organophosphate flame retardant) at the environmentally relevant concentrations to the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) larvae was investigated. Larvae were exposed to 20 ??g/L of microplastic fragments or 20 and 100 ??g/L of TPhP or a combination of both for 7 days. The results showed that the three microplastics did not affect the larval locomotor activity. For TPhP, the larval moving duration and distance moved were significantly decreased by the TPhP exposure, with a maximum decrease of 43.5% and 59.4% respectively. Exposure to 100 ??g/L TPhP respectively down-regulated the expression levels of sine oculis homeobox homologue 3 (six3) and short wavelength-sensitive type 2 (sws2) by 19.1% and 41.7%, suggesting that TPhP might disturb eye development and photoreception and consequently the low locomotor activity in the larvae. Interestingly, during the binary mixture exposure, the presence of PS, PS-COOH or PS-NH2 reversed the low locomotor activity induced by 100 ??g/L TPhP to the normal level. Relative to the larvae from the 100 ??g/L TPhP group, the movement duration and distance moved were increased by approximately 60% and 100%, respectively, in the larvae from the TPhP + PS, TPhP + PS-COOH and TPhP + PS-NH2 groups. However, the gene expression profiles were distinct among the fish from the TPhP + PS, TPhP + PS-COOH and TPhP + PS-NH2 groups, implying different mechanisms underlying the reversal of the locomotor activity. The findings in this study challenge the general view that microplastics aggravate the toxicity of the adsorbed pollutants, and help better understand the environmental risk of microplastic pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
3PLVKZIL,Fabrication of bio-based amphiphilic hydrogel coating with excellent antifouling and mechanical properties,"Antifouling coatings are crucial to protect marine facilities and aquacultures from the damage of microorganisms for long-term serves. However, it is still a challenge to fabricate coating with excellent antifouling performance and superior mechanical stability. Here, we report a bio-based amphiphilic hydrogel coating with excellent antifouling and mechanical properties. The coating was achieved by the in-situ formation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interpenetrating polymer network (IPN). The hydrophobic part from a synthesized silicon-containing epoxy resin contributes to superior mechanical properties including high tensile strength and excellent adhesion of 5B. While the hydrophilic hydrogel part from the cross-linking of a hydrophilic polymer with AgNPs gives excellent antifouling properties, resist to proteins, bacteria, algae, and other marine organisms. The antifouling performance of the coating was evaluated by the attachment of proteins (BSA-FITC), bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis), and Algae (Navicula torguatum and Phaeodactylum tricornutum). The results show that the bio-based amphiphilic hydrogel coating (e.g. SA-1-5) endows surface with excellent resistance to the fouling of proteins, bacteria and microorganisms. The overall antifouling and mechanical properties of the amphiphilic coating was also evaluated by field test in East China Sea from June 3rd 2020 to July 17th 2020 that the bio-based amphiphilic hydrogel coating was intact and almost no marine organisms attached. This work provides a new strategy for the fabrication of bio-based and high-performance antifouling coatings. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
5R3FGNMU,Enriched antibacterial and antifouling performance of organoclay filled hybrid epoxy composites,"Organically changed montmorillonite (OMMT) can significantly enhance the surface property of composite blends. In this present work, for the first time we have reported the enhanced antifouling performance on the substrate, combined with cured epoxy (CE), unsaturated polyester (UP), and organically changed montmorillonite (OMMT) blends. The newly developed CE-UP-OMMT materials were submerged into the real time marine environment with the other samples of glass, plastic, fibre (broadly used in the ship hull), and wood. Since the contact angle is increased, the surface energy is decreased to the epoxy toughened blend incorporated with clay and thus showing enhanced antibacterial and antifouling properties. It provides promising results in 1 and 3 wt% clay incorporated epoxy with 10 wt% UP composite blends which improved antibacterial and antifouling performance during the microbial and macro-fouling activity in the real-time marine environment for around three months. In the future, these blends could be new opportunities for the marine industry. ?? 2020",
MANE3FW7,Cigarette butts as a microfiber source with a microplastic level of concern,"Microplastic pollution is a growing environmental concern among the scientific community. These small particles (<5 mm) might come from the fragmentation or direct emission of artificial and synthetic polymers. Among them, the microfibers (MF) are one of the most common types of microplastics identified in the environment. On the other hand, the most encountered type of garbage found in clean-up campaigns is the cigarette butts, which contains the smoked filters (SF) and unsmoked rests of tobacco. SFs are hazardous debris but are usually not properly disposed as such, and are composed of >15,000 strands that can be detached as MFs. This study aims to evaluate the detachment rate, the acute aquatic toxicity, and the aquatic-, thermooxidative-, and photo-degradability of the MFs generated from SFs. In this way, it was found that SFs detach approximately 100 small MFs (<0.2 mm) per day. In a rough estimation, about 0.3 million tons of potential MFs might be annually reaching aquatic environments from this source. Concerning the eco-toxicity, a statistically significant difference was found when MFs are present in the leachate generated by the SFs, where the Daphnia magna EC100 and EC50 were of 0.620 SF/L and 0.017 SF/L, respectively. Finally, the degradability of the SFs was evaluated by applying two methods (ATR-FTIR analysis and gravimetry). In both of them, a low degradability rate was observed. Thus, it may be concluded that MFs from SFs constitute an important source of microplastics, which might partially explain the high concentration of artificial polymers that have been found in the deep-sea sediments. Yet, the correct management of the SFs is an unsolved issue that should receive urgent attention. Capsule: This work evaluates the detachment rate, toxicity, and degradability of the microfibers detached from the cigarette butts. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
7W624HBD,Microplastic pollution in surface water and sediments in the urban section of the Vistula River (Poland),"The main hypothesis of this study was that the microplastic (MP) concentration would be higher in the city centre. The MP (&lt;5 mm) abundance and distribution in the urbanized section of the Vistula River were examined. Samples were collected from three different sites: 1) the less urbanized part of the city, 2) the area close to the tributary outlet and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and 3) the city centre. The abundance of MPs in water ranged from 1.6 to 2.55 items L???1, whereas in the sediments, it varied from 190 to 580 items kg???1. The highest MP concentration was observed in the water collected in the city centre. However, in the case of sediments, the most polluted sample was collected from a sampling point located near the WWTP and tributary outlet. The diversity of the MPs abundance along the river was associated with the hydrological and sedimentological conditions, which was confirmed by the grain size analysis of sediments. The dominant type of MPs in both the water and sediment samples was fibre. The MPs were characterized by Raman spectroscopy as polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and a variety of other materials with different levels of deterioration. The images obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed different disintegration features. Moreover, the SEM analyses revealed the occurrence of adhered particles and diatoms on the surface of MPs. The adsorption of various elements onto the MPs surface and the adhered particles was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The conducted studies emphasized the significance of the impact of large urban agglomerations, such as the Warsaw metropolitan area, on the concentration of MPs in rivers. Further studies are needed to better assess, for instance, the precise mode through which MPs in urban regions are transported by rivers to the seas. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
68IN8EX2,Dynamic bond behaviour of fibre-wrapped basalt fibre-reinforced polymer bars embedded in sea sand and recycled aggregate concrete under high-strain rate pull-out tests,"Using sea sand instead of river sand and recycled coarse aggregates instead of natural coarse aggregates to prepare sea sand and recycled aggregate concrete (SSRAC) can help preserve sand and stone resources, reduce construction costs, and protect ecological environments. However, the chloride ions in sea sand corrode steel bars, posing a safety risk to concrete structures. Fibre-reinforced polymer bars, which have a high strength and are lightweight and chloride corrosion-resistant, are used instead of steel bars to avoid chloride corrosion. In this study, the dynamic bond behaviour of fibre-wrapped basalt fibre-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars embedded in SSRAC was evaluated via high-strain rate pull-out tests. Ten loading rates were applied to assess the effects of static, seismic, and impact loads on the bond performance. The damage characteristics of the concrete?????BFRP bar interface were analysed, and the bond mechanism was ascertained. The characteristics of the bond stress?????slip curves were examined, and the effects of the strain rate on the bond strength, slip, and stiffness were investigated. Finally, formulae describing the dynamic effects of these factors on the bond strength, slip, and stiffness were proposed to predict the dynamic bond behaviour. The findings presented herein can guide the application and development of BFRP bar-reinforced SSRAC structures and provide a theoretical basis and experimental support for dynamic design methods to enhance their bond performance. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
2R85TDHM,Atmospheric deposition of microplastics in the coastal zone: Characteristics and relationship with meteorological factors,"In this study, the quantitative and qualitative compositions of microplastics (MPs) deposited from the atmosphere in the coastal zone were analysed. Moreover, links between MP deposition and meteorological factors (air humidity, wind speed, precipitation height, and air mass trajectories) were investigated. MP deposition samples were collected in the southern Baltic area in 2017 and 2018 for 286 days in total. The morphological features of MPs (shape and size) were analysed using a digital microscope. Qualitative analysis was performed using micro-attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (??ATR FT-IR). The size of the deposited MPs ranged from 5 ??m to 5000 ??m, and smaller size classes (&lt;720 ??m) were predominant (70%). Fibres were of the dominant type (60%). Films and fragments constituted 26% and 14% of the total MPs, respectively, while 55% of the MPs found in the study were polymers often used in textiles, packaging materials, and fishing gear (polyesters and polypropylene). The atmospheric MP deposition ranged from 0 m???2??d???1 to 30 m???2??d???1 (average: 10 ?? 8 m???2??d???1; median: 8 m???2??d???1). Based on the air mass trajectory cluster analysis, MPs deposited in Gdynia mainly originated from local sources (&lt;100 km). Furthermore, higher MP deposition occurred when the inflowing air masses were terrestrial, and lower deposition occurred when they were marine. On average, during wet periods twice the amount of MPs was deposited in comparison with dry periods. During dry periods deposition increased with increasing wind speed and was intensified by high relative humidity. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
KCGAE626,Marine litter footprint in the Azores Islands: A climatological perspective,"Marine litter (ML) consists of any item of anthropogenic origin that has been lost, discarded or intentionally disposed of into the environment, being acknowledged as a worldwide environmental and ecological threat. In the last decade, there has been an attempt across different sectors to tackle, reduce and mitigate sources of litter. In this study, meso and macrodebris between 2 and 30 cm was recorded and classified in two established study areas (Porto Pim and Concei????o beaches), throughout five monitoring years (2012?????2018). The litter abundance, density and weighted average by abundance were evaluated in eight main categories: plastics, cloths/fabrics, glass, metals, rubber, processed lumber, other and large. Field surveys provided evidence that plastic represented 95% of all litter. ML abundance was treated as an ?????environmental variable????? and used to determine its anomalies, temporal trends and forecasts. Results from this time-series addressed possible periodic oscillations and density peaks of litter. Reference values of ML presence were obtained and could potentially be used for developing a diagnostic tool for anthropogenic pollution in the Azores. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
QVRJ9ZEL,A novel thermoanalytical method for quantifying microplastics in marine sediments,"Microplastic pollution in marine environments is of particular concern on its risk to the ecosystem. To assess and manage microplastic contaminants, their quantitative detection in environmental samples is a high priority. However, uncertainties of current methods still exist when estimating their abundances, particularly with fine-grained (<1 mm) microplastics. This work reports a novel thermoanalytical method for quantifying microplastics by measuring the contents of microplastic-derived carbon (MPC) in samples under the premise of nearly eliminating the limit of their particle appearances. After validating the method via samples with the spiked microplastics, we have conducted a case study on sediment core H43 that spanned 1925?????2009 CE from the Yellow Sea for further illustrating the high reliability and practicability of this method for quantifying microplastics in natural samples. Our results have demonstrated that the proposed method may be a promising technique to determine the mass-related concentrations of the total microplastics in marine sediments for evaluating their pollution status and quantitative contribution to marine carbon storage. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
937UL4D6,Current understanding and challenges for aquatic primary producers in a world with rising micro- and nano-plastic levels,"The impacts of micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) on aquatic animals have been intensively studied; however, the extent and magnitude of potential effects of MNPs on aquatic primary producers are poorly understood. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the published literature to examine the impacts of MNPs on growth, photosynthesis, pigments, and metabolism of aquatic microalgae. MNPs negatively affected growth of microalgae but usually had a high EC50 (&gt; 25 mg/L). However, positively charged MNPs had a much lower EC50 (&lt; 1 mg/L). MNPs lowered maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) with the effect increasing with concentration of MNPs but diminishing with exposure time, and also reduced chlorophyll a content to enhanced extent with increased MNPs concentration. MNPs induced relatively higher changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in marine algae than in freshwater algae. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increased with MNPs concentration and exposure time while SOD levels first increased and then decreased with increasing MNPs concentration. Macrophytes were found to be able to trap MNPs via multiple mechanisms. Future work should focus on the mechanisms behind MNPs impacts on primary productivity and global carbon cycle, and the combined effects of MNPs with other environmental factors. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
HPZWK44I,"Analysis of small microplastics in coastal surface water samples of the subtropical island of Okinawa, Japan","Marine plastic debris is widely recognized as a global environmental issue. Small microplastic particles, with an upper size limit of 20 ??m, have been identified as having the highest potential for causing damage to marine ecosystems. Having accurate methods for quantifying the abundance of such particles in a natural environment is essential for defining the extent of the problem they pose. Using an optical micro-Raman tweezers setup, we have identified the composition of particles trapped in marine aggregates collected from the coastal surface waters around the subtropical island of Okinawa. Chemical composition analysis at the single-particle level indicates dominance by low-density polyethylene, which accounted for 75% of the small microplastics analysed. The smallest microplastics identified were (2.53 ?? 0.85) ??m polystyrene. Our results show the occurrence of plastics at all test sites, with the highest concentration in areas with high human activities. We also observed additional Raman peaks on the plastics spectrum with decreasing debris size which could be related to structural modification due to weathering or embedding in organic matter. By identifying small microplastics at the single-particle level, we obtain some indication on their dispersion in the ocean which could be useful for future studies on their potential impact on marine biodiversity. ?? 2020 The Authors",
4CPSWVR4,"Fish out, plastic in: Global pattern of plastics in commercial fishmeal","Plastic (as both micro- and macro- plastic) is an important environmental contaminant, affecting the food chain and directly entering into marine products, including seafood. However, plastic contamination in wild derived fishmeal, a globally traded commodity, remains unknown. Using a global sampling approach, this study is the first one to assess the plastic content and composition in commercial fishmeal products. The sampling consisted of 26 different fishmeal products, originating from 11 countries on four continents and Antarctica, and representing the vast majority of globally available and traded commercial products. A wide range of plastics content was found, ranging from 0 to 526.7 n kg-1, and a relatively higher plastics content was identified in fishmeal obtained from China (337.5??34.5 n kg-1) and Morocco (253.3??43.4 n kg???1), whereas no plastics was detected in krill meal obtained from Antarctica. The risk assessment based on feed conversion ratio (FCR) showed that the carnivorous fish species (e.g. eel) with a high percentage of dietary fishmeal, have a substantially higher risk for plastic intake, than other species. In conclusion, these results indicate that fishmeal can be an important pathway for plastics to enter the seafood chain. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
EME4YSJE,Microplastics in the Black Sea sediments,"In this study the occurrence, morphology and identification of microplastics in Black Sea sediments collected at different depths (range 22?????2131 m) were determined for the first time. The study explored the advantages and limitations of using a non-invasive method consisting of filtration of the supernatant from the mixture of sediment with saturated NaCl solution followed by FTIR 2D imaging for the identification of natural and synthetic polymers. The proposed method confirmed its potential for clear identification of polyethylene, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, polyamides and cellulose-based fibers, but more difficulties when the filter substrate neighboring the fibers exhibits intense absorptions in the 1800?????1000 cm???1 range. Microplastics (MPs) were determined in 83% of the investigated sediment samples. The average abundance in all samples was 106.7 items/kg. The highest pollution occurred on the North-Western shelf where the abundance of MPs was 10 times higher than in sediments from the deep sea. The most abundant plastic polymers were polyethylene and polypropylene, followed by acrylate and acrylonitrile copolymers. Polyamide and cellulose-based textile fibers were also found. The most frequent microplastic colors observed were black, blue and clear/transparent, while fibers represented the dominant microplastics in sediments. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
V9L82RMS,A robust and anticorrosion non-fluorinated superhydrophobic aluminium surface for microplastic removal,"Solid particulate pollutants such as microplastics constitute a global environmental issue in the 21st century. Many studies are exploring ways of removing these particles from marine environments such as seas and oceans. Here, we present a superhydrophobic surface obtained by combining anodisation and the liquid-phase deposition of lauric acid. The superhydrophobic surface was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to elucidate its hierarchical structure and wetting state, while time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) were applied to identify the chemical composition of the surface, which revealed that aluminium laurate decreased the surface free energy. As microplastics are usually found in saline water, it was important to study the anticorrosion properties of the surface. Polarisation curves of the anodised surface showed excellent anticorrosion properties in 3.5 wt% NaCl aqueous solution, which was enhanced by the superhydrophobic properties when the aluminium surface was anodised for 60 min. The functionalised surface was superhydrophobic (154??) and superoleophilic (0??). These wetting properties allowed the surface to remove microplastics from the NaCl aqueous solution with an efficiency higher than 99%. Thus, we present a novel application of a superhydrophobic and anticorrosive surface in the removal of microplastics. This has not been reported previously and provides a new scope for superwettable materials and their environmental applications. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
7NB9W7AF,"Microplastic pollution and its relationship with the bacterial community in coastal sediments near Guangdong Province, South China","The ecological stress caused by microplastic (MP) pollution in marine environments has attracted global attention. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between MP pollution and the microbial community in natural sediments. This study was the first to systematically characterize MP pollution (i.e., its abundance, shape, size and color) and investigate its relationship with the bacterial community in coastal sediments from Guangdong, South China, by microscopic observation and Illumina sequencing. The results of this study indicated that the abundance of microplastics (MPs), which was 344 ?? 24 items/kg in 33 coastal sediments from 11 sites from South China, represented a relatively high level of MP pollution. MPs with sizes of <0.5 m, 0.5?????1.0 mm and 1?????2 mm accounted for the highest proportion (75%) in the sediments. Fiber/film (82%) and white/blue (91%) were the dominant shapes and colors, respectively, in all MP samples. Furthermore, the abundances, three shapes (fiber, film and fragment), three sizes (<0.5 mm, 0.5?????1.0 mm and 1?????2 mm), and two colors (blue and white) of MPs displayed positive correlations with some potential pathogens, including Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Streptococcus, but exhibited negative correlations with an environmentally friendly bacterial genus, Sphingomonas (which degrades various hazardous organic compounds), indicating that MPs might increase the potential ecological risks of coastal sediments. Our results may help to elucidate the relationship between MP pollution and the microbial community in coastal sediments. ?? 2020",
XL5GP6ME,Leaching of polybrominated diphenyl ethers from microplastics in fish oil: Kinetics and bioaccumulation,"Microplastics (MPs) contain high levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which can leach to organism tissues upon ingestion, thereby leading to increased chemical exposure. However, leaching kinetics of inherent contaminants from ingested MPs are poorly studied. The present study characterized the leaching kinetics of PBDEs from sub-millimeter sized MPs in fish oil at relevant body temperatures for marine organisms and assessed exposure risk of MPs for cod fish by a biodynamic model. Diffusion coefficients (Dp) of PBDEs are in the ranges of 1.98 ?? 10-19?????2.35 ?? 10-16 m2??s-1 in polystyrene, 1.89 ?? 10-20?????2.07 ?? 10-18 m2??s-1 in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, and 4.26 ?? 10-18?????1.72 ?? 10-15 m2??s-1 in polypropylene. A linear function obtained between log Dp of BDE-209 and glass-transition temperature of MPs allows estimation of Dp of BDE-209 contained in other common types of MPs present in the gastrointestinal lipid. The biota-plastic accumulation factors of PBDEs for three plastics were in the range of 4.77 ?? 10-14?????4.03 ?? 10-7. Although bioaccumulation of MPs-affiliated PBDEs is accelerated by oil in the gastrointestinal tract, the modeled steady-state concentrations of PBDEs in cod tissue lipid through ingestion of MPs under the most likely conditions were below the lower end of the global PBDE concentration, implicating that ingestion of MPs by organisms remains a negligible pathway in general. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
BWSR8QIQ,"Microplastics in the environment: Occurrence, perils, and eradication","Microplastics (MPs) with sizes &lt; 5 mm are found in various compositions, shapes, morphologies, and textures that are the major sources of environmental pollution. The fraction of MPs in total weight of plastic accumulation around the world is predicted to be 13.2% by 2060. These micron-sized MPs are hazardous to marine species, birds, animals, soil creatures and humans due to their occurrence in air, water, soil, indoor dust and food items. The present review covers discussions on the damaging effects of MPs on the environment and their removal techniques including biodegradation, adsorption, catalytic, photocatalytic degradation, coagulation, filtration and electro-coagulation. The main techniques used to analyze the structural and surface changes such as cracks, holes and erosion post the degradation processes are FTIR and SEM analysis. In addition, reduction in plastic molecular weight by the microbes implies disintegration of MPs. Adsorptive removal by the magnetic adsorbent promises complete elimination while the biodegradable catalysts could remove 70?????100% of MPs. Catalytic degradation via advanced oxidation assisted by SO4???????? or OH????? radicals generated by peroxymonosulfate or sodium sulfate are also adequately covered in addition to photocatalysis. The chemical methods such as sol?????gel, agglomeration, and coagulation in conjunction with other physical methods are discussed concerning the drinking water/wastewater/sludge treatments. The efficacy, merits and demerits of the currently used removal approaches are reviewed that will be helpful in developing more sophisticated technologies for the complete mitigation of MPs from the environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
55CUHVYF,Environmental occurrence of phthalate and organophosphate esters in sediments across the Gulf of Lion (NW Mediterranean Sea),"Seven phthalate (PAEs) and nine organophosphate esters (OPEs) were measured in surface sediments across the Gulf of Lion (NW Mediterranean Sea) at twelve stations characterized by different anthropogenic signatures. ???PAEs and ???OPEs concentrations ranged from 2 to 766 ng/g DW (av. 196 ng/g DW) and from 4 to 227 ng/g DW (av. 54 ng/g DW), respectively. Our analysis of the potential sources of these organic plastic additives in sediments of the Gulf of Lion suggests that the dominant factors affecting their occurrence and environmental distribution are port-based industrial activities and urban pressures. Indeed, the highest ???PAEs and ???OPEs concentrations were found close to the ports of Toulon and Marseille (Estaque) and at the sites impacted by the Marseille metropolitan area (i.e. at the outlets of the waste water treatment plant at Cortiou and at the mouth of the Huveaune River). The lowest levels were generally found in protected areas (e.g. Port-Cros) and at sites relatively far from the coast. DEHP was seen to be the most abundant PAE while TDCP, TEHP and TiBP were the most abundant OPEs in the area. Our results also expose the contribution of additives entering the Gulf of Lion via sedimentary material from the Rh??ne River, with positive correlations between the total organic carbon (TOC) content in the sediment and the ???PAEs and ???OPEs concentrations. However, additive concentrations decreased from shore to offshore in the Rh??ne River discharge area, indicating an efficient dilution of the contaminants accumulated at the river mouth area. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
KV9XPT8U,Effect of the chloride environmental exposure on the flexural performance of strengthened RC beams with self-anchored prestressed CFRP plates,"Carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates are widely used to strengthen reinforced-concrete (RC) structures. At present, most studies focused on the short-term performance of strengthened RC beams with a prestressed CFRP plate, and very limited information is available on their durability, which is of importance in certain cases, such as high-piled wharfs and bridges in marine environments. This study investigates the effects of chloride environment exposure on the flexural performance of strengthened RC beams with self-anchored prestressed CFRP plates. In total, seven RC beams, four of which were strengthened by a self-anchored prestressed CFRP plate, were fabricated and tested under three-point bending. The testing parameters included 25% and 40% prestress level of the ultimate tensile strength of the CFRP plate, 5% and 10% tensile steel rebar corrosion ratio of mass loss and 10% and 20% anchor corrosion ratio in the chloride environment. The evolution of time-dependent prestress losses in the strengthened beam was determined, and the flexural behaviour of the strengthened beams was analysed. A theoretical model is proposed to predict the flexural strength of prestressed CFRP strengthened RC beams in a chloride environment. The experimental results indicated that the coupling of the corrosion expansion of the metal anchor and rebar in the chloride environment had a large negative effect on the flexural performance of the beams strengthened by the self-anchored prestressed CFRP plates. After exposure to the chloride ion solution, the failure mode of the RC beams strengthened by the prestressed CFRP changed from concrete crushing in the compression section to anchor pullout. The proposed model, which considered the effect of a chloride environment to predict the flexural strength of the strengthened beams, agreed well with the test results. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
8RGC4UB8,"First evidence of microplastic contamination in the freshwater of Lake Gua??ba, Porto Alegre, Brazil","The ubiquitous presence of microplastics in the aquatic environment has raised concern about their potential impacts on and risks to the biota. While the presence of microplastics in a marine environment has been well studied, the impact of microplastic contamination in freshwater bodies is understudied. In the present study, baseline data about contamination with microplastics in Lake Gua??ba in southern Brazil are presented. The abundance, distribution, and composition of microplastics in the surface of this freshwater body were investigated, and these parameters were correlated with population density, land occupation, wind, and geohydrologic processes. The samples were collected with a manta net (60 ??m mesh size). Microplastics were found in all the samples, with an average of 11.9 ?? 0.6 to 61.2 ?? 6.1 items m???3, which indicates the widespread contamination of the lake with plastic particles. The most frequent microplastic morphology was the fragment type in the size range of 100 to 250 ??m, and the predominant colours were white/transparent and red. Measurement uncertainty of the visual microplastic counts showed that black colour microplastics is more susceptible to be mistaken, which might lead to an underestimation and/or overestimation of the total number of microplastics. Polypropylene and polyethylene together comprised most of the polymer types (98%). Micro-Fourier transform infrared (micro-FTIR) spectroscopy analyses showed that 58% of the analysed polymers were highly oxidised, indicating long residence of this particles in the water. In addition, our data show that the distribution of microplastics is strongly influenced by the geohydrological characteristics of the lake. Therefore, this research may provide information for further investigations of microplastic distribution in Lake Gua??ba and can serve as a base to improve the regulations regarding waste management to effectively reduce microplastic pollution in freshwater systems. Additionally, the measurement uncertainty showed that black microplastics are more susceptible to variations in their measurements. ?? 2020",
ZYPRQ54T,Polystyrene microplastics alter the intestinal microbiota function and the hepatic metabolism status in marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma),"To assess the potential effects of microplastics (MPs) on gut microbiome, a simple investigation of gut microbial structure is not sufficient, and the function and association of gut microbial structure with host health should also be taken into account. Here, the effects of two particle sizes (2 and 200 ??m) of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) on the gut microbiota of medaka were evaluated following oral administration at 0.3 and 3.0 ??g/mg for 28 days. No change in body length and gut histopathology damage were observed. However, the exposure to PS-MPs significantly decreased fish body weight and disrupted the liver anti-oxidative status. The PS-MPs caused a shift in the gut microbial structure of medaka accompanied by changes in community function, including significant environmental stress, increased carbon degradation/fixation activities, and partially modified nitrogen/phosphorus/sulfur metabolic abilities. Furthermore, the PS-MPs exposure disturbed the glycolipid/tyrosine/energy metabolism and the endocrine balance. A potential correlation between the gut microecology and host response to PS-MPs exposure was also observed. These results indicated that the PS-MPs may contribute to gut-liver axis disruption, which could be the underlying toxicological mechanisms of PS-MPs exposure. This work has improved our knowledge about the relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and host metabolic disorders following MPs exposure. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
SLQD2HMT,Experimental study on the effects of glass fibres and expansive agent on the bond behaviour of glass/basalt FRP bars in seawater sea-sand concrete,"In seawater sea-sand concrete (SSSC), to avoid steel corrosion, the use of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars as reinforcement has been proposed. However, FRP bars do not have strong ribs for bonding, and thus, may have weaker bonds compared to steel reinforcing bars. To overcome this problem, the addition of fibres and expansive agent to concrete to induce gripping stresses on FRP bars may be a feasible solution. In this research, the effects of glass fibres and expansive agent on the bond behaviour of glass/basalt FRP bars cast in SSSC were studied by conducting pull-out tests with varying fibre content, fibre length, and expansive agent content. The results revealed that although the addition of glass fibres and/or the expansive agent significantly increases the bond stiffness, it only marginally increases the bond strength of the FRP bars. Overall, the addition of both fibres and the expansive agent offers certain synergistic effects; however, improving the bond strength is still difficult owing to the premature failure of the FRP bars. Finally, constitutive models to simulate the bond behaviour of FRP bars in SSSC were proposed. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
