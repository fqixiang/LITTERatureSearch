3D5HUXSL,Preliminary indoor evidences of microplastic effects on freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates,"Plastics are to date considered one of the main detrimental drivers for the health of aquatic ecosystems, both in marine and inland waters. Regarding the latter habitat, it seems surprising how the plastic effects on benthic invertebrates are neglected since macroinvertebrates have a long tradition in the water quality assessment activities. In this context, we propose timely indoor observations on the exposure of caddisfly Odontocerum albicorne and mayfly Ephemera danica to various microplastic polymers (ABS, PET, PP, PS, PVDF). Three different experimental designs were performed on caddisflies and mayflies by exposing their larvae to natural and microplastic substrates. Our findings highlighted how microplastics affected both caddisflies in rebuilding its own case (after having removed the natural one) and mayflies burrowing. Particularly, all caddisflies rebuilt cases using the microplastic polymers provided instead of natural items only. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that mayflies burrow mainly in microplastic substrates rather than in natural ones. Our research highlights that macroinvertebrate larvae would use naturally occurring microplastics and this could be of particular concern in freshwaters with high contamination by plastics. Indeed, larvae appear to not necessarily perceive microplastics as a direct stressor. Further studies ought to be conducted to understand the chronic perturbation on larvae fitness and for example, on drift behaviour. Also, further investigations are needed to understand the potentialities of using plastics by benthic macroinvertebrates. ?? 2021, The Author(s).",0
KE2NTCS7,The effect of natural fillers on the marine biodegradation behaviour of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV),"Worldwide, improper disposal of plastics is instigating environmental initiatives to combat plastics accumulation of in the environment and the world?????s oceans. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) biocomposites with Miscanthus (Misc) fibres and distillers????? dried grains with solubles (DDGS) were studied to ascertain if natural fibres and proteinaceous fillers can improve polyhydroxyalkanoate marine biodegradability. Using ASTM standard D7991-15, the biodegradation of PHBV, PHBV with Misc (15 and 25 wt%) and PHBV with DDGS (15 and 25 wt%) was performed in a simulated marine environment for the first time, as indicated by a literature survey. PHBV/Misc (85/15) and (75/25) biocomposites showed 15 and 25% more biodegradation compared to PHBV, respectively. Proteinaceous PHBV/DDGS (85/15) and (75/25) biocomposites showed 17 and 40% more biodegradation compared to PHBV, respectively. Furthermore, PHBV/Misc (75/25) and PHBV/DDGS (75/25) biocomposites were marine biodegraded in 412 and 295 days, respectively. In conclusion, proteinaceous fillers (DDGS) biocomposites have better marine biodegradability than miscanthus. ?? 2021, The Author(s).",0
BELAGTQW,Effects of intermittent loading time and stress ratio on dwell fatigue behavior of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V ELI used in deep-sea submersibles,"Different components of deep-sea submersibles, such as the pressure hull, are usually subjected to intermittent loading, dwell loading, and unloading during service. Therefore, for the design and reliability assessment of structural parts under dwell fatigue loading, understanding the effects of intermittent loading time on dwell fatigue behavior of the alloys is essential. In this study, the effects of the intermittent loading time and stress ratio on dwell fatigue behavior of the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4 V ELI were investigated. Results suggest that the dwell fatigue failure modes of Ti-6Al-4 V ELI can be classified into three types, i.e., fatigue failure mode, ductile failure mode, and mixed failure mode. The intermittent loading time does not affect the dwell fatigue behavior, whereas the stress ratio significantly affects the dwell fatigue life and dwell fatigue mechanism. The dwell fatigue life increases with an increase in the stress ratio for the same maximum stress, and specimens with a negative stress ratio tend to undergo ductile failure. The mechanism of dwell fatigue of titanium alloys is attribute to an increase in the plastic strain caused by the part of the dwell loading, thereby resulting in an increase in the actual stress of the specimens during the subsequent loading cycles and aiding the growth of the formed crack or damage, along with the local plastic strain or damage induced by the part of the fatigue load promoting the cumulative plastic strain during the dwell fatigue process. The interaction between dwell loading and fatigue loading accelerates specimen failure, in contrast to the case for individual creep or fatigue loading alone. The dwell fatigue life and cumulative maximum strain during the first loading cycle could be correlated by a linear relationship on the log?????log scale. This relationship can be used to evaluate the dwell fatigue life of Ti alloys with the maximum stress dwell. ?? 2020",0
JMPMKT8S,Factors influencing the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in coastal sediments: From source to sink,"Microplastic (MP) pollution is attracting growing global attention, but little is known about the factors influencing MP occurrence and distributions in marine sediments. Here, MPs were sampled from the sediments of two semi-enclosed bays (Jinghai Bay and Laizhou Bay) and two coastal open zones (Lancelet Reserve and Solen grandis Reserve) in China. The order of MP abundance was Jinghai Bay > Laizhou Bay > Lancelet Reserve > Solen grandis Reserve. Average MP diversity indices for Laizhou Bay (1.84 ?? 0.18), Lancelet Reserve (1.59 ?? 0.43), S. grandis Reserve (1.58 ?? 0.89), and Jinghai Bay (1.43 ?? 0.14) revealed Laizhou Bay had the most complicated MP sources. A significant negative correlation between MP abundance and sediment grain size occurred in the semi-enclosed coastal zones (p = 0.004, r = ???0.618) rather than in the open coastal zones (p = 0.051, r = ???0.480), indicating small sediment particles can strongly enhance MP accumulation in semi-enclosed costal sediments. Although anthropogenic activities influence the MP distribution at source, the composition of regional and local sediments might impact MP occurrence in semi-enclosed coastal zones from the sink. These results help to improve our understanding of the fate and inventory of MPs in coastal sediments. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",1
NV3P66HB,"Neglected microplastics pollution in the nearshore surface waters derived from coastal fishery activities in Weihai, China","Plastic fishing gears have been widely used in marine fishing and mariculture, which could cause serious microplastics pollution but receive little attention. To further figure out the effect of fishery activities on microplastics, the occurrence and sources of microplastics contamination in the nearshore surface seawater of Weihai (a coastal fishery city of China) were studied. All the collected microplastics were sorted and counted based on their size, shape, and color. The distribution of microplastics pollution in this study areas was mapped. The results showed that the mean concentration of all sampling sites was 5.9??3.5 particles/m3; the concentration in the mariculture areas was 11.49 particles/m3, much higher than that in other areas without mariculture 1.57 particles/m3. Fragment and fiber accounted for 45.4% and 28.2% of the total microplastics, respectively. Most fibers and fragments were identified as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), mainly originated from the fishing nets/ropes. Polystyrene (PS) was also generally detected in the samples due to the foam floating balls used in the mariculture area. Our research strongly suggested that marine fishery activities, especially for mariculture, could be an underestimated sea-based microplastics source and more attentions should be given. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",1
U8ICGBMY,"Assessing small-scale freshwater microplastics pollution, land-use, source-to-sink conduits, and pollution risks: Perspectives from Japanese rivers polluted with microplastics","Rivers are vital for understanding freshwater microplastics pollution, along with the conduits from land-sources to marine-sinks. In this study, we investigated microplastics in the small-scale Awano and Ayaragi rivers, which flow into the Sea of Japan (SJ), and the Asa and Majime rivers, which flow into the Seto Inland Sea (SIS) in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. Surface water samples were collected from 29 stations. Filtration, wet peroxidation, and density separation methods were employed to extract microplastics. Polymers were identified via attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Microplastics abundances and comparisons among different rivers revealed that these small-scale rivers were highly polluted than others around the world. Characterization demonstrated that small microplastics (<1000 ??m) in size, fibers and fragments in shape and the polymers?????polyethylene, polypropylene, vinylon, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene were dominant. These small-scale rivers emitted substantially higher quantities of Japan land-sourced microplastics (0.4?????154.27 billions/day and 0.01?????17.55 tons/day) into the SJ and SIS environments than larger rivers in other countries compared to basin areas. The pollution load index indicated that all the river stations were polluted with microplastics. An assessment of the polymeric and pollution risks revealed variably low to high risks. The higher were the abundances of microplastics and toxic polymers, the higher were the pollution level and risks. The sites at high risk of pollution were regarded as hotspots. Both point and non-point land-uses sources of pollution could release microplastics into the river freshwater environments, affected posing high risks and hotspots. Moreover, the pollution characteristics (shapes-sizes-colors-polymers) indicated serious ecotoxicological threats to these rivers and their downstream environments. This study provided new insights into river microplastics pollution and revealed small-scale rivers to be prominent source-to-sink microplastics conduits. Risk assessments provided a baseline for future comprehensive assessments and developing practical approaches to wards setting water quality criteria, pollution control and management. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",0
F47I5TSJ,"Recommended best practices for collecting, analyzing, and reporting microplastics in environmental media: Lessons learned from comprehensive monitoring of San Francisco Bay","Microplastics are ubiquitous and persistent contaminants in the ocean and a pervasive and preventable threat to the health of marine ecosystems. Microplastics come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and plastic types, each with unique physical and chemical properties and toxicological impacts. Understanding the magnitude of the microplastic problem and determining the highest priorities for mitigation require accurate measures of microplastic occurrence in the environment and identification of likely sources. The field of microplastic pollution is in its infancy, and there are not yet widely accepted standards for sample collection, laboratory analyses, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), or reporting of microplastics in environmental samples. Based on a comprehensive assessment of microplastics in San Francisco Bay water, sediment, fish, bivalves, stormwater, and wastewater effluent, we developed recommended best practices for collecting, analyzing, and reporting microplastics in environmental media. We recommend factors to consider in microplastic study design, particularly in regard to site selection and sampling methods. We also highlight the need for standard QA/QC practices such as collection of field and laboratory blanks, use of methods beyond microscopy to identify particle composition, and standardized reporting practices, including suggested vocabulary for particle classification. ?? 2021 The Authors",1
ISHRGXSQ,Selection of antibiotic resistance genes on biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics,"Growing evidence have demonstrated that microplastics in the marine ecosystem can provide novel substrates for biofilm formation, potentially facilitating the spread of antibiotic resistance. However, the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the biofilm on microplastics has not been fully explored. This study used the metagenomic data of biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics staged at a coastal lagoon in the northern Gulf of Mexico to profile the ARGs and their bacterial hosts. The abundance and Shannon diversity of ARGs on biodegradable poly hydroxy alkanoate (PHA) and non-biodegradable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) have no significant differences. Nevertheless, the abundance of multidrug resistance genes on PET (3.05 copies per 16S rRNA) was statistically higher than that on PHA (2.05). Beta diversity showed that the overall pattern of resistome on PHA was significantly distinct with that on PET. Procrustes analysis suggested a good-fit correlation between ARG profiles and bacterial community composition. The host-tracking analysis identified that Pseudomonas was always the major host for glycopeptide and multidrug resistance genes in PET and PHA biofilms, whereas the primary host for macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) changed to Desulfovibrio on PET. This study provided the first metagenomic insights into the ARGs and their hosts on biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics, suggesting that both two types of plastics harbor ARGs with preferences. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
QXA7D4HT,You are what you eat: Microplastics in the feces of young men living in Beijing,"Purpose: Microplastics have been widely detected in the environment and marine organisms. However, few studies have investigated the presence of microplastics in humans. This preliminary study identified and quantified the microplastic content in human feces. Methods: A total of 26 young male students aged 18?????25 years were recruited from Beijing, China. A self-administered 7-day 24-h fluid intake record was used to document fluid intake, and food intake was recorded for 3 days. Feces were collected by participants using a sterile fecal collector. Microplastics in the remaining fecal residues were measured and identified using fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy. Results: Eventually, twenty-four participants completed the study. The fecal samples of 23 (95.8%) participants tested positive for microplastics. In these 23 samples, the abundance of microplastics varied from 1 particle/g to 36 particles/g (size 20 to 800 ??m). The summed mass of all microplastic particles per participant ranged from 0.01 to 14.6 mg. Qualitative analysis of the microplastics indicated the presence of one to eight types of microplastics in each sample, with polypropylene (PP) being the most abundant; it was found in 95.8% of fecal samples. We examined associations between water intake habits and the abundance of microplastics in their feces. A moderate correlation was observed between packaged water and beverage intake and microplastic abundance in feces (r = 0.445, P = 0.029). Conclusion: Various types of microplastics were detected in human feces, with PP being found in the highest proportion. There may be an association between water intake habits and microplastic abundance in feces. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
RVA3A2QG,"Microplastics in seafood as an emerging threat to marine environment: A case study in Goa, west coast of India","The present study exhibits the occurrence of MPs in different matrices (water, sediment and biota) from the Sal estuary, Goa, situated on the central west coast of India. The average numbers of MPs in the water column and sediment were 48 ?? 19 MP particles/L (MPs/L) and 3950 ?? 930 MP particles/kg (MPs/kg), respectively. In shellfish (whole soft tissue), the average concentrations of MPs were 4 ?? 2 (Crassostrea sp.), 3.2 ?? 1.8 (Perna viridis) and 0.7 ?? 0.3 (Paphia malbarica) MPs/g body weight (bw), respectively. The highest MPs were recorded in finfish (gastro-intestinal tract) (Mugil cephalus)7.8 ?? 4, followed by (Gerres filamentosus) 5.3 ?? 4.9, (Arius jella) 4.6 ?? 2.6, and (Etroplus suratensis)1.4 ?? 0.3 MP/g bw. MP fibres were predominant in all matrices. Interestingly, a dominance of small sized (10?????300 ??m) MPs was recorded in biota. Among the 37 polymer types identified by ??-FTIR, the most prevalent ones were, polyacrylamide (PAM), polyacetylene, ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyamide (nylon). Notably, the polymers dominant in the gut of finfish and in whole shellfish were equally prominent in sediment and the water column. This study highlights the presence of MPs in commercially important shellfish and finfish samples from the Sal estuary. This study clearly shows the presence of MPs in various types of marine organisms in the Sal estuary. As shellfish is locally consumed as a delicacy and plays a major role in the seafood industry, the MPs may pose a hazard for human health. There is also an ecological risk as MPs are also found in water and sediment and in the digestive tract of finfish. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
85WBN3ZI,Microplastics in different tissues of wild crabs at three important fishing grounds in China,"Crabs are an indispensable component of the benthic ecosystem and represent a type of seafood that is easily obtained and frequently eaten by humans. However, little is known about microplastic (MP) accumulation in different tissues of crabs in important fishing areas. In this study, the abundances and characteristics of MPs in different tissues of four species of wild crabs (Portunus trituberculatus, Charybdis japonica, Dorippe japonica, and Matuta planipes) were investigated across 9 sites at three important fishing grounds (Haizhou Bay, Lvsi and Yangtze River Estuary fishing grounds) in China. Crabs from all sites were found to contain MPs, with a total detection rate of 89.34%. The MP abundance in crabs from all sites ranged from 2.00 ?? 2.00 to 9.81 ?? 8.08 items/individual and 0.80 ?? 1.09 to 22.71 ?? 24.56 items/g wet weight. The abundance of MPs exponentially increased with decreasing MP size. The MPs were dominated by fibers in terms of shape, black-gray and blue-green in terms of color and cellophane in terms of composition. MPs were found in the gills and guts of the crabs, but not in the muscles. The abundance and size of the MPs in the guts were significantly higher than those in the gills, but there was no significant difference in color or shape. In addition, crab eating patterns have a significant impact on the abundance of MPs in different species. The abundance of MPs in the saprophytic crabs was significantly higher than that in the predatory crabs. MP contamination in crabs is worthy of attention for human health and the stability of marine ecosystems. ?? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",0
J9QPQ7ED,"Comparative life cycle assessment of system solution scenarios for residual municipal solid waste management in NSW, Australia","Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a promising tool to evaluate the environmental impacts of different technologies for sustainable waste management. This study employs LCA to assess environmental impacts of alternative scenarios for residual municipal solid waste (MSW) management in New South Wales (NSW) based on current conditions and policies. Six different scenarios including a baseline scenario (landfilling) were applied for NSW waste management for energy production and their impacts on environment. The initial results showed that the scenario 3 that employed anaerobic digestion for food waste, incineration for combustible waste and plastic waste, and landfilling for non-combustible waste produced electricity of 625 kWh/t, which was maximum compared to the other scenarios. LCA results further suggested that among all scenarios, scenario 5 (similar to scenario 3 except combustible waste was treated through gasification and plastic waste was recycled) has the lowest level of environmental burdens in global warming, freshwater and marine ecotoxicity, and human non-carcinogenic toxicity. The sensitivity analysis for energy conversion rates (23?????30%) for incineration and plastic recycling rate (66?????91.3%) for MSW was further conducted and the results showed that energy conversion rate of 30% makes scenario 3 more valuable for electricity generation and less impactful for ecosystems damage category compared to scenario 5. On the other hand, plastic recycling rate of 91.3% has the lowest environmental burdens and by decreasing recycling rate to 66% the environmental impacts increase; however, it was noticed that reduction in recycling rate does not make any change in the order of scenarios. Overall, the study suggests that each waste type in NSW should be treated with a specific technology to achieve the highest resource recovery and lowest environmental impacts where energy conversion and plastic recycling rates have significant impacts. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
CC6XHSPG,Low surface energy self-polishing polymer grafted MWNTs for antibacterial coating and controlled-release property of Cu2O,"Marine biofouling had been a headache when engaging in marine activities. The most effective and convenient method for dealing with this problem was to apply antifouling coatings. But now a single anti-fouling system was hard to satisfy the requirement of anti-fouling simultaneously. Therefore, it was particularly important to develop novel multi-system anti-fouling technology. In the work, a novel polymer coatings with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) segments in the main chain and hydrolysable side chain was designed and synthesized which showed low surface energy and self-polishing performance, and then we creatively covalently immobilized the polyurethane on the surface of multi-carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to form multisystem antifouling coating. The results showed that the polymer coating would produce hydrolysable regions in the hydrophobic PDMS segment to endure the polymer coating hydrophobic and hydrolysis properties when contacted with water. In addition, the self-polishing rate and the surface energy could be regulated by varying its copolymerization, and the addition of MWNTs could kill the microorganisms and endowed the polymer coating itself enhanced antibacterial effect. Furthermore, considering the high specific surface area and physicochemical characteristics of MWNTs, it could be combined with antifoulant Cu2O through a polar or non-polar combination as a carrier to control the release rate of Cu2O in coatings. ?? 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",0
56B3WSTG,Comparative study of three sampling methods for microplastics analysis in seawater,"Microplastics, as an emerging pollutant, are widely spread in the oceans. The sampling method is the most basic and important factor affecting the reported microplastic abundance data. Three sampling methods, most commonly used for microplastic collection, including direct filtration with 0.45 ??m pore size membrane, 20 ??m sieve pre-concentration followed by 0.45 ??m filtration and Manta trawling with a 150 ??m mesh size net were studied. The results showed that there were orders of magnitude difference in abundance of microplastic across the three methods with 0.45 ??m direct filtration yielding 1600.0?????4000.0 items/m3, 20 ??m sieve pre-concentration yielding 10.0?????50.0 items/m3, and 150 ??m trawl net yielding 0.13?????0.24 items/m3. The polymer types of microplastic collected by the three methods were similar, but polymer proportions were different. PES and rayon dominated in the samples collected by direct filtration and sieve pre-concentration. PES and PP accounted for a higher proportion in the trawling samples. The abundance and polymer types of microplastics had a clear correlation between direct filtration and sieve pre-concentration (p &lt; 0.05). More microplastic shapes were found in trawling samples. The average and median sizes of microplastics increased with increasing pore or mesh size. According to the size fraction and standard deviation of microplastic size in different samples of each method, the stability of method decreased with increasing pore or mesh size. The trawling method had a higher sampling efficiency, but its stability was weaker than the other two methods. Our results suggested that an appropriate method should be selected upon actual sampling condition and available tools during the research process to improve the credibility of the results. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
6QNQ3T5I,Deep seafloor plastics as the source and sink of organic pollutants in the northern South China Sea,"Large plastic litter (as opposed to microplastics and plastic pellets) could adsorb organic pollutants and thus pose a serious threat to the marine environment. We report high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) adsorbed to plastic litter sampled from depths of 1800?????3100 m in the Xisha Trough region of the northern South China Sea (NSCS). ???PCBs on plastics ranged from 126.9?????142.1 ng/g, with tri-PCBs accounting for 92?????97% of the total PCB concentrations in all samples. Levels of ???OCPs varied from 4280 to 5351 ng/g (average 4690 ng/g), with a total of 19 compounds detected in the seven samples. While no parent DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) was detected, op?????-DDE (metabolite of DDT) was most abundant, with concentrations ranging from 947.5?????1551.7 ng/g. ???CHLs (heptachlor + heptachlor epoxide A + heptachlor epoxide B + cis-chlordane + trans-chlordane) ranged from 1083.1?????1263.7 ng/g (mean 1153 ng/g) and accounted for 24% of ???OCPs. Various compositional ratios of HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDT metabolites improved our understanding of the sources and transport pathways of OCPs. The total absence of DDT may be a ?????ghost indicator????? of no recent DDT inputs into the oceans. There could well be inputs of DDT, but only as the degraded metabolites DDE and DDD when they are adsorbed to seafloor plastic litter. A comparison of HCH isomer ratios in seafloor plastics with technical HCH ratios revealed that HCHs were possibly not from early residues but from later inputs. An ecological risk assessment of the contaminants indicated a high risk from ???DDTs, p,p-DDE, and ??-HCH in all the sampled locations. Finally, we propose a descriptive model depicting the movements and transportation of PCBs and OCPs from the ocean surface to seafloor plastics in the NSCS. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
FKPQ2AKB,Insight into the characteristics and sorption behaviors of aged polystyrene microplastics through three type of accelerated oxidation processes,"Ageing process can significantly alter the structural properties, environmental behaviors and potential ecotoxicity of microplastics (MPs) in water. In this study, the structural properties of aged polystyrene (PS) MPs being exposed to UV/H2O, UV/H2O2 and UV/Cl2 artificially accelerated oxidation processes and related sorption behaviors of bisphenol A (BPA) on those virgin/aged PS were investigated. The surface oxidation and hydrophilicity of aged PS were significantly increased according to infrared spectroscopy (IR) and water contact angle (CA) measurements. The differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) revealed apparent degradation of aged PS especially in their amorphous domain. Obviously deteriorative BPA sorption capacity on aged PS was observed compared with that of virgin PS. The sorption rates of BPA on aged PS were accelerated and sorption of BPA shifted from partition dominant mechanism on virgin PS to the adsorption dominant mechanism through being fitted with the dual-mode sorption model. Besides, ageing in UV/Cl2 system introduces C?????Cl groups on the surface of PS which strengthen the combination with BPA through halogen bonding interaction. Salt and dissolved organic matters (DOM) in marine water may increase the BPA sorption on aged MPs due to enhanced polar interaction. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
SQ5YFXQ3,COVID-19 pandemic repercussions on plastic and antiviral polymeric textile causing pollution on beaches and coasts of South America,"The propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide has been alarming in the last months. According to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the use of face masks is essential for slowing down the transmission rate of COVID-19 in human beings. This pandemic has generated a substantial increase in the use, as well as in the production, of face masks and other elements (gloves, face protectors, protective suits, safety shoes) manufactured with polymeric materials, including antiviral textiles most of which will end as microplastic pools. Focusing on South America, the use and mismanagement of this type of personal protective equipment (PPE) represents an environmental problem. Added to this issue are the increase in the use of single-use plastic, and the reduction of plastic recycling due to the curfew generated by the pandemic, further aggravating plastic pollution on coasts and beaches. Recently, researchers have developed antiviral polymeric textile technology composed of Ag and Cu nanoparticles for PPE to reduce the contagion and spread of COVID-19. Antiviral polymeric textile wastes could also have long-term negative repercussions on aquatic environments, as they are an important emerging class of contaminants. For this reason, this work provides reflections and perspectives on how the COVID-19 pandemic can aggravate plastic pollution on beaches and coastal environments, consequently increasing the damage to marine species in the coming years. In addition, the potential impact of the pandemic on waste management systems is discussed here, as well as future research directions to improve integrated coastal management strategies. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
TW5V6G8J,Microplastics decrease the toxicity of triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) in the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) larvae,"Plastics have been recognized as a serious threat to the environment. Besides their own toxicity, microplastics can interact with other environmental pollutants, acting as carriers and potentially modulating their toxicity. In this study, the toxicity of polystyrene (PS) microplastic fragments (plain PS; carboxylated PS, PS-COOH and aminated PS, PS-NH2) and triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) (an emerging organophosphate flame retardant) at the environmentally relevant concentrations to the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) larvae was investigated. Larvae were exposed to 20 ??g/L of microplastic fragments or 20 and 100 ??g/L of TPhP or a combination of both for 7 days. The results showed that the three microplastics did not affect the larval locomotor activity. For TPhP, the larval moving duration and distance moved were significantly decreased by the TPhP exposure, with a maximum decrease of 43.5% and 59.4% respectively. Exposure to 100 ??g/L TPhP respectively down-regulated the expression levels of sine oculis homeobox homologue 3 (six3) and short wavelength-sensitive type 2 (sws2) by 19.1% and 41.7%, suggesting that TPhP might disturb eye development and photoreception and consequently the low locomotor activity in the larvae. Interestingly, during the binary mixture exposure, the presence of PS, PS-COOH or PS-NH2 reversed the low locomotor activity induced by 100 ??g/L TPhP to the normal level. Relative to the larvae from the 100 ??g/L TPhP group, the movement duration and distance moved were increased by approximately 60% and 100%, respectively, in the larvae from the TPhP + PS, TPhP + PS-COOH and TPhP + PS-NH2 groups. However, the gene expression profiles were distinct among the fish from the TPhP + PS, TPhP + PS-COOH and TPhP + PS-NH2 groups, implying different mechanisms underlying the reversal of the locomotor activity. The findings in this study challenge the general view that microplastics aggravate the toxicity of the adsorbed pollutants, and help better understand the environmental risk of microplastic pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
3PLVKZIL,Fabrication of bio-based amphiphilic hydrogel coating with excellent antifouling and mechanical properties,"Antifouling coatings are crucial to protect marine facilities and aquacultures from the damage of microorganisms for long-term serves. However, it is still a challenge to fabricate coating with excellent antifouling performance and superior mechanical stability. Here, we report a bio-based amphiphilic hydrogel coating with excellent antifouling and mechanical properties. The coating was achieved by the in-situ formation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interpenetrating polymer network (IPN). The hydrophobic part from a synthesized silicon-containing epoxy resin contributes to superior mechanical properties including high tensile strength and excellent adhesion of 5B. While the hydrophilic hydrogel part from the cross-linking of a hydrophilic polymer with AgNPs gives excellent antifouling properties, resist to proteins, bacteria, algae, and other marine organisms. The antifouling performance of the coating was evaluated by the attachment of proteins (BSA-FITC), bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis), and Algae (Navicula torguatum and Phaeodactylum tricornutum). The results show that the bio-based amphiphilic hydrogel coating (e.g. SA-1-5) endows surface with excellent resistance to the fouling of proteins, bacteria and microorganisms. The overall antifouling and mechanical properties of the amphiphilic coating was also evaluated by field test in East China Sea from June 3rd 2020 to July 17th 2020 that the bio-based amphiphilic hydrogel coating was intact and almost no marine organisms attached. This work provides a new strategy for the fabrication of bio-based and high-performance antifouling coatings. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
5R3FGNMU,Enriched antibacterial and antifouling performance of organoclay filled hybrid epoxy composites,"Organically changed montmorillonite (OMMT) can significantly enhance the surface property of composite blends. In this present work, for the first time we have reported the enhanced antifouling performance on the substrate, combined with cured epoxy (CE), unsaturated polyester (UP), and organically changed montmorillonite (OMMT) blends. The newly developed CE-UP-OMMT materials were submerged into the real time marine environment with the other samples of glass, plastic, fibre (broadly used in the ship hull), and wood. Since the contact angle is increased, the surface energy is decreased to the epoxy toughened blend incorporated with clay and thus showing enhanced antibacterial and antifouling properties. It provides promising results in 1 and 3 wt% clay incorporated epoxy with 10 wt% UP composite blends which improved antibacterial and antifouling performance during the microbial and macro-fouling activity in the real-time marine environment for around three months. In the future, these blends could be new opportunities for the marine industry. ?? 2020",0
MANE3FW7,Cigarette butts as a microfiber source with a microplastic level of concern,"Microplastic pollution is a growing environmental concern among the scientific community. These small particles (<5 mm) might come from the fragmentation or direct emission of artificial and synthetic polymers. Among them, the microfibers (MF) are one of the most common types of microplastics identified in the environment. On the other hand, the most encountered type of garbage found in clean-up campaigns is the cigarette butts, which contains the smoked filters (SF) and unsmoked rests of tobacco. SFs are hazardous debris but are usually not properly disposed as such, and are composed of >15,000 strands that can be detached as MFs. This study aims to evaluate the detachment rate, the acute aquatic toxicity, and the aquatic-, thermooxidative-, and photo-degradability of the MFs generated from SFs. In this way, it was found that SFs detach approximately 100 small MFs (<0.2 mm) per day. In a rough estimation, about 0.3 million tons of potential MFs might be annually reaching aquatic environments from this source. Concerning the eco-toxicity, a statistically significant difference was found when MFs are present in the leachate generated by the SFs, where the Daphnia magna EC100 and EC50 were of 0.620 SF/L and 0.017 SF/L, respectively. Finally, the degradability of the SFs was evaluated by applying two methods (ATR-FTIR analysis and gravimetry). In both of them, a low degradability rate was observed. Thus, it may be concluded that MFs from SFs constitute an important source of microplastics, which might partially explain the high concentration of artificial polymers that have been found in the deep-sea sediments. Yet, the correct management of the SFs is an unsolved issue that should receive urgent attention. Capsule: This work evaluates the detachment rate, toxicity, and degradability of the microfibers detached from the cigarette butts. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
7W624HBD,Microplastic pollution in surface water and sediments in the urban section of the Vistula River (Poland),"The main hypothesis of this study was that the microplastic (MP) concentration would be higher in the city centre. The MP (&lt;5 mm) abundance and distribution in the urbanized section of the Vistula River were examined. Samples were collected from three different sites: 1) the less urbanized part of the city, 2) the area close to the tributary outlet and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and 3) the city centre. The abundance of MPs in water ranged from 1.6 to 2.55 items L???1, whereas in the sediments, it varied from 190 to 580 items kg???1. The highest MP concentration was observed in the water collected in the city centre. However, in the case of sediments, the most polluted sample was collected from a sampling point located near the WWTP and tributary outlet. The diversity of the MPs abundance along the river was associated with the hydrological and sedimentological conditions, which was confirmed by the grain size analysis of sediments. The dominant type of MPs in both the water and sediment samples was fibre. The MPs were characterized by Raman spectroscopy as polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and a variety of other materials with different levels of deterioration. The images obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed different disintegration features. Moreover, the SEM analyses revealed the occurrence of adhered particles and diatoms on the surface of MPs. The adsorption of various elements onto the MPs surface and the adhered particles was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The conducted studies emphasized the significance of the impact of large urban agglomerations, such as the Warsaw metropolitan area, on the concentration of MPs in rivers. Further studies are needed to better assess, for instance, the precise mode through which MPs in urban regions are transported by rivers to the seas. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
68IN8EX2,Dynamic bond behaviour of fibre-wrapped basalt fibre-reinforced polymer bars embedded in sea sand and recycled aggregate concrete under high-strain rate pull-out tests,"Using sea sand instead of river sand and recycled coarse aggregates instead of natural coarse aggregates to prepare sea sand and recycled aggregate concrete (SSRAC) can help preserve sand and stone resources, reduce construction costs, and protect ecological environments. However, the chloride ions in sea sand corrode steel bars, posing a safety risk to concrete structures. Fibre-reinforced polymer bars, which have a high strength and are lightweight and chloride corrosion-resistant, are used instead of steel bars to avoid chloride corrosion. In this study, the dynamic bond behaviour of fibre-wrapped basalt fibre-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars embedded in SSRAC was evaluated via high-strain rate pull-out tests. Ten loading rates were applied to assess the effects of static, seismic, and impact loads on the bond performance. The damage characteristics of the concrete?????BFRP bar interface were analysed, and the bond mechanism was ascertained. The characteristics of the bond stress?????slip curves were examined, and the effects of the strain rate on the bond strength, slip, and stiffness were investigated. Finally, formulae describing the dynamic effects of these factors on the bond strength, slip, and stiffness were proposed to predict the dynamic bond behaviour. The findings presented herein can guide the application and development of BFRP bar-reinforced SSRAC structures and provide a theoretical basis and experimental support for dynamic design methods to enhance their bond performance. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
2R85TDHM,Atmospheric deposition of microplastics in the coastal zone: Characteristics and relationship with meteorological factors,"In this study, the quantitative and qualitative compositions of microplastics (MPs) deposited from the atmosphere in the coastal zone were analysed. Moreover, links between MP deposition and meteorological factors (air humidity, wind speed, precipitation height, and air mass trajectories) were investigated. MP deposition samples were collected in the southern Baltic area in 2017 and 2018 for 286 days in total. The morphological features of MPs (shape and size) were analysed using a digital microscope. Qualitative analysis was performed using micro-attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (??ATR FT-IR). The size of the deposited MPs ranged from 5 ??m to 5000 ??m, and smaller size classes (&lt;720 ??m) were predominant (70%). Fibres were of the dominant type (60%). Films and fragments constituted 26% and 14% of the total MPs, respectively, while 55% of the MPs found in the study were polymers often used in textiles, packaging materials, and fishing gear (polyesters and polypropylene). The atmospheric MP deposition ranged from 0 m???2??d???1 to 30 m???2??d???1 (average: 10 ?? 8 m???2??d???1; median: 8 m???2??d???1). Based on the air mass trajectory cluster analysis, MPs deposited in Gdynia mainly originated from local sources (&lt;100 km). Furthermore, higher MP deposition occurred when the inflowing air masses were terrestrial, and lower deposition occurred when they were marine. On average, during wet periods twice the amount of MPs was deposited in comparison with dry periods. During dry periods deposition increased with increasing wind speed and was intensified by high relative humidity. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
KCGAE626,Marine litter footprint in the Azores Islands: A climatological perspective,"Marine litter (ML) consists of any item of anthropogenic origin that has been lost, discarded or intentionally disposed of into the environment, being acknowledged as a worldwide environmental and ecological threat. In the last decade, there has been an attempt across different sectors to tackle, reduce and mitigate sources of litter. In this study, meso and macrodebris between 2 and 30 cm was recorded and classified in two established study areas (Porto Pim and Concei????o beaches), throughout five monitoring years (2012?????2018). The litter abundance, density and weighted average by abundance were evaluated in eight main categories: plastics, cloths/fabrics, glass, metals, rubber, processed lumber, other and large. Field surveys provided evidence that plastic represented 95% of all litter. ML abundance was treated as an ?????environmental variable????? and used to determine its anomalies, temporal trends and forecasts. Results from this time-series addressed possible periodic oscillations and density peaks of litter. Reference values of ML presence were obtained and could potentially be used for developing a diagnostic tool for anthropogenic pollution in the Azores. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
QVRJ9ZEL,A novel thermoanalytical method for quantifying microplastics in marine sediments,"Microplastic pollution in marine environments is of particular concern on its risk to the ecosystem. To assess and manage microplastic contaminants, their quantitative detection in environmental samples is a high priority. However, uncertainties of current methods still exist when estimating their abundances, particularly with fine-grained (<1 mm) microplastics. This work reports a novel thermoanalytical method for quantifying microplastics by measuring the contents of microplastic-derived carbon (MPC) in samples under the premise of nearly eliminating the limit of their particle appearances. After validating the method via samples with the spiked microplastics, we have conducted a case study on sediment core H43 that spanned 1925?????2009 CE from the Yellow Sea for further illustrating the high reliability and practicability of this method for quantifying microplastics in natural samples. Our results have demonstrated that the proposed method may be a promising technique to determine the mass-related concentrations of the total microplastics in marine sediments for evaluating their pollution status and quantitative contribution to marine carbon storage. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
937UL4D6,Current understanding and challenges for aquatic primary producers in a world with rising micro- and nano-plastic levels,"The impacts of micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) on aquatic animals have been intensively studied; however, the extent and magnitude of potential effects of MNPs on aquatic primary producers are poorly understood. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the published literature to examine the impacts of MNPs on growth, photosynthesis, pigments, and metabolism of aquatic microalgae. MNPs negatively affected growth of microalgae but usually had a high EC50 (&gt; 25 mg/L). However, positively charged MNPs had a much lower EC50 (&lt; 1 mg/L). MNPs lowered maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) with the effect increasing with concentration of MNPs but diminishing with exposure time, and also reduced chlorophyll a content to enhanced extent with increased MNPs concentration. MNPs induced relatively higher changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in marine algae than in freshwater algae. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increased with MNPs concentration and exposure time while SOD levels first increased and then decreased with increasing MNPs concentration. Macrophytes were found to be able to trap MNPs via multiple mechanisms. Future work should focus on the mechanisms behind MNPs impacts on primary productivity and global carbon cycle, and the combined effects of MNPs with other environmental factors. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
HPZWK44I,"Analysis of small microplastics in coastal surface water samples of the subtropical island of Okinawa, Japan","Marine plastic debris is widely recognized as a global environmental issue. Small microplastic particles, with an upper size limit of 20 ??m, have been identified as having the highest potential for causing damage to marine ecosystems. Having accurate methods for quantifying the abundance of such particles in a natural environment is essential for defining the extent of the problem they pose. Using an optical micro-Raman tweezers setup, we have identified the composition of particles trapped in marine aggregates collected from the coastal surface waters around the subtropical island of Okinawa. Chemical composition analysis at the single-particle level indicates dominance by low-density polyethylene, which accounted for 75% of the small microplastics analysed. The smallest microplastics identified were (2.53 ?? 0.85) ??m polystyrene. Our results show the occurrence of plastics at all test sites, with the highest concentration in areas with high human activities. We also observed additional Raman peaks on the plastics spectrum with decreasing debris size which could be related to structural modification due to weathering or embedding in organic matter. By identifying small microplastics at the single-particle level, we obtain some indication on their dispersion in the ocean which could be useful for future studies on their potential impact on marine biodiversity. ?? 2020 The Authors",1
4CPSWVR4,"Fish out, plastic in: Global pattern of plastics in commercial fishmeal","Plastic (as both micro- and macro- plastic) is an important environmental contaminant, affecting the food chain and directly entering into marine products, including seafood. However, plastic contamination in wild derived fishmeal, a globally traded commodity, remains unknown. Using a global sampling approach, this study is the first one to assess the plastic content and composition in commercial fishmeal products. The sampling consisted of 26 different fishmeal products, originating from 11 countries on four continents and Antarctica, and representing the vast majority of globally available and traded commercial products. A wide range of plastics content was found, ranging from 0 to 526.7 n kg-1, and a relatively higher plastics content was identified in fishmeal obtained from China (337.5??34.5 n kg-1) and Morocco (253.3??43.4 n kg???1), whereas no plastics was detected in krill meal obtained from Antarctica. The risk assessment based on feed conversion ratio (FCR) showed that the carnivorous fish species (e.g. eel) with a high percentage of dietary fishmeal, have a substantially higher risk for plastic intake, than other species. In conclusion, these results indicate that fishmeal can be an important pathway for plastics to enter the seafood chain. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
EME4YSJE,Microplastics in the Black Sea sediments,"In this study the occurrence, morphology and identification of microplastics in Black Sea sediments collected at different depths (range 22?????2131 m) were determined for the first time. The study explored the advantages and limitations of using a non-invasive method consisting of filtration of the supernatant from the mixture of sediment with saturated NaCl solution followed by FTIR 2D imaging for the identification of natural and synthetic polymers. The proposed method confirmed its potential for clear identification of polyethylene, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, polyamides and cellulose-based fibers, but more difficulties when the filter substrate neighboring the fibers exhibits intense absorptions in the 1800?????1000 cm???1 range. Microplastics (MPs) were determined in 83% of the investigated sediment samples. The average abundance in all samples was 106.7 items/kg. The highest pollution occurred on the North-Western shelf where the abundance of MPs was 10 times higher than in sediments from the deep sea. The most abundant plastic polymers were polyethylene and polypropylene, followed by acrylate and acrylonitrile copolymers. Polyamide and cellulose-based textile fibers were also found. The most frequent microplastic colors observed were black, blue and clear/transparent, while fibers represented the dominant microplastics in sediments. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
V9L82RMS,A robust and anticorrosion non-fluorinated superhydrophobic aluminium surface for microplastic removal,"Solid particulate pollutants such as microplastics constitute a global environmental issue in the 21st century. Many studies are exploring ways of removing these particles from marine environments such as seas and oceans. Here, we present a superhydrophobic surface obtained by combining anodisation and the liquid-phase deposition of lauric acid. The superhydrophobic surface was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to elucidate its hierarchical structure and wetting state, while time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) were applied to identify the chemical composition of the surface, which revealed that aluminium laurate decreased the surface free energy. As microplastics are usually found in saline water, it was important to study the anticorrosion properties of the surface. Polarisation curves of the anodised surface showed excellent anticorrosion properties in 3.5 wt% NaCl aqueous solution, which was enhanced by the superhydrophobic properties when the aluminium surface was anodised for 60 min. The functionalised surface was superhydrophobic (154??) and superoleophilic (0??). These wetting properties allowed the surface to remove microplastics from the NaCl aqueous solution with an efficiency higher than 99%. Thus, we present a novel application of a superhydrophobic and anticorrosive surface in the removal of microplastics. This has not been reported previously and provides a new scope for superwettable materials and their environmental applications. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
7NB9W7AF,"Microplastic pollution and its relationship with the bacterial community in coastal sediments near Guangdong Province, South China","The ecological stress caused by microplastic (MP) pollution in marine environments has attracted global attention. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between MP pollution and the microbial community in natural sediments. This study was the first to systematically characterize MP pollution (i.e., its abundance, shape, size and color) and investigate its relationship with the bacterial community in coastal sediments from Guangdong, South China, by microscopic observation and Illumina sequencing. The results of this study indicated that the abundance of microplastics (MPs), which was 344 ?? 24 items/kg in 33 coastal sediments from 11 sites from South China, represented a relatively high level of MP pollution. MPs with sizes of <0.5 m, 0.5?????1.0 mm and 1?????2 mm accounted for the highest proportion (75%) in the sediments. Fiber/film (82%) and white/blue (91%) were the dominant shapes and colors, respectively, in all MP samples. Furthermore, the abundances, three shapes (fiber, film and fragment), three sizes (<0.5 mm, 0.5?????1.0 mm and 1?????2 mm), and two colors (blue and white) of MPs displayed positive correlations with some potential pathogens, including Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Streptococcus, but exhibited negative correlations with an environmentally friendly bacterial genus, Sphingomonas (which degrades various hazardous organic compounds), indicating that MPs might increase the potential ecological risks of coastal sediments. Our results may help to elucidate the relationship between MP pollution and the microbial community in coastal sediments. ?? 2020",1
XL5GP6ME,Leaching of polybrominated diphenyl ethers from microplastics in fish oil: Kinetics and bioaccumulation,"Microplastics (MPs) contain high levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which can leach to organism tissues upon ingestion, thereby leading to increased chemical exposure. However, leaching kinetics of inherent contaminants from ingested MPs are poorly studied. The present study characterized the leaching kinetics of PBDEs from sub-millimeter sized MPs in fish oil at relevant body temperatures for marine organisms and assessed exposure risk of MPs for cod fish by a biodynamic model. Diffusion coefficients (Dp) of PBDEs are in the ranges of 1.98 ?? 10-19?????2.35 ?? 10-16 m2??s-1 in polystyrene, 1.89 ?? 10-20?????2.07 ?? 10-18 m2??s-1 in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, and 4.26 ?? 10-18?????1.72 ?? 10-15 m2??s-1 in polypropylene. A linear function obtained between log Dp of BDE-209 and glass-transition temperature of MPs allows estimation of Dp of BDE-209 contained in other common types of MPs present in the gastrointestinal lipid. The biota-plastic accumulation factors of PBDEs for three plastics were in the range of 4.77 ?? 10-14?????4.03 ?? 10-7. Although bioaccumulation of MPs-affiliated PBDEs is accelerated by oil in the gastrointestinal tract, the modeled steady-state concentrations of PBDEs in cod tissue lipid through ingestion of MPs under the most likely conditions were below the lower end of the global PBDE concentration, implicating that ingestion of MPs by organisms remains a negligible pathway in general. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
BWSR8QIQ,"Microplastics in the environment: Occurrence, perils, and eradication","Microplastics (MPs) with sizes &lt; 5 mm are found in various compositions, shapes, morphologies, and textures that are the major sources of environmental pollution. The fraction of MPs in total weight of plastic accumulation around the world is predicted to be 13.2% by 2060. These micron-sized MPs are hazardous to marine species, birds, animals, soil creatures and humans due to their occurrence in air, water, soil, indoor dust and food items. The present review covers discussions on the damaging effects of MPs on the environment and their removal techniques including biodegradation, adsorption, catalytic, photocatalytic degradation, coagulation, filtration and electro-coagulation. The main techniques used to analyze the structural and surface changes such as cracks, holes and erosion post the degradation processes are FTIR and SEM analysis. In addition, reduction in plastic molecular weight by the microbes implies disintegration of MPs. Adsorptive removal by the magnetic adsorbent promises complete elimination while the biodegradable catalysts could remove 70?????100% of MPs. Catalytic degradation via advanced oxidation assisted by SO4???????? or OH????? radicals generated by peroxymonosulfate or sodium sulfate are also adequately covered in addition to photocatalysis. The chemical methods such as sol?????gel, agglomeration, and coagulation in conjunction with other physical methods are discussed concerning the drinking water/wastewater/sludge treatments. The efficacy, merits and demerits of the currently used removal approaches are reviewed that will be helpful in developing more sophisticated technologies for the complete mitigation of MPs from the environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
55CUHVYF,Environmental occurrence of phthalate and organophosphate esters in sediments across the Gulf of Lion (NW Mediterranean Sea),"Seven phthalate (PAEs) and nine organophosphate esters (OPEs) were measured in surface sediments across the Gulf of Lion (NW Mediterranean Sea) at twelve stations characterized by different anthropogenic signatures. ???PAEs and ???OPEs concentrations ranged from 2 to 766 ng/g DW (av. 196 ng/g DW) and from 4 to 227 ng/g DW (av. 54 ng/g DW), respectively. Our analysis of the potential sources of these organic plastic additives in sediments of the Gulf of Lion suggests that the dominant factors affecting their occurrence and environmental distribution are port-based industrial activities and urban pressures. Indeed, the highest ???PAEs and ???OPEs concentrations were found close to the ports of Toulon and Marseille (Estaque) and at the sites impacted by the Marseille metropolitan area (i.e. at the outlets of the waste water treatment plant at Cortiou and at the mouth of the Huveaune River). The lowest levels were generally found in protected areas (e.g. Port-Cros) and at sites relatively far from the coast. DEHP was seen to be the most abundant PAE while TDCP, TEHP and TiBP were the most abundant OPEs in the area. Our results also expose the contribution of additives entering the Gulf of Lion via sedimentary material from the Rh??ne River, with positive correlations between the total organic carbon (TOC) content in the sediment and the ???PAEs and ???OPEs concentrations. However, additive concentrations decreased from shore to offshore in the Rh??ne River discharge area, indicating an efficient dilution of the contaminants accumulated at the river mouth area. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
KV9XPT8U,Effect of the chloride environmental exposure on the flexural performance of strengthened RC beams with self-anchored prestressed CFRP plates,"Carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates are widely used to strengthen reinforced-concrete (RC) structures. At present, most studies focused on the short-term performance of strengthened RC beams with a prestressed CFRP plate, and very limited information is available on their durability, which is of importance in certain cases, such as high-piled wharfs and bridges in marine environments. This study investigates the effects of chloride environment exposure on the flexural performance of strengthened RC beams with self-anchored prestressed CFRP plates. In total, seven RC beams, four of which were strengthened by a self-anchored prestressed CFRP plate, were fabricated and tested under three-point bending. The testing parameters included 25% and 40% prestress level of the ultimate tensile strength of the CFRP plate, 5% and 10% tensile steel rebar corrosion ratio of mass loss and 10% and 20% anchor corrosion ratio in the chloride environment. The evolution of time-dependent prestress losses in the strengthened beam was determined, and the flexural behaviour of the strengthened beams was analysed. A theoretical model is proposed to predict the flexural strength of prestressed CFRP strengthened RC beams in a chloride environment. The experimental results indicated that the coupling of the corrosion expansion of the metal anchor and rebar in the chloride environment had a large negative effect on the flexural performance of the beams strengthened by the self-anchored prestressed CFRP plates. After exposure to the chloride ion solution, the failure mode of the RC beams strengthened by the prestressed CFRP changed from concrete crushing in the compression section to anchor pullout. The proposed model, which considered the effect of a chloride environment to predict the flexural strength of the strengthened beams, agreed well with the test results. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
8RGC4UB8,"First evidence of microplastic contamination in the freshwater of Lake Gua??ba, Porto Alegre, Brazil","The ubiquitous presence of microplastics in the aquatic environment has raised concern about their potential impacts on and risks to the biota. While the presence of microplastics in a marine environment has been well studied, the impact of microplastic contamination in freshwater bodies is understudied. In the present study, baseline data about contamination with microplastics in Lake Gua??ba in southern Brazil are presented. The abundance, distribution, and composition of microplastics in the surface of this freshwater body were investigated, and these parameters were correlated with population density, land occupation, wind, and geohydrologic processes. The samples were collected with a manta net (60 ??m mesh size). Microplastics were found in all the samples, with an average of 11.9 ?? 0.6 to 61.2 ?? 6.1 items m???3, which indicates the widespread contamination of the lake with plastic particles. The most frequent microplastic morphology was the fragment type in the size range of 100 to 250 ??m, and the predominant colours were white/transparent and red. Measurement uncertainty of the visual microplastic counts showed that black colour microplastics is more susceptible to be mistaken, which might lead to an underestimation and/or overestimation of the total number of microplastics. Polypropylene and polyethylene together comprised most of the polymer types (98%). Micro-Fourier transform infrared (micro-FTIR) spectroscopy analyses showed that 58% of the analysed polymers were highly oxidised, indicating long residence of this particles in the water. In addition, our data show that the distribution of microplastics is strongly influenced by the geohydrological characteristics of the lake. Therefore, this research may provide information for further investigations of microplastic distribution in Lake Gua??ba and can serve as a base to improve the regulations regarding waste management to effectively reduce microplastic pollution in freshwater systems. Additionally, the measurement uncertainty showed that black microplastics are more susceptible to variations in their measurements. ?? 2020",0
ZYPRQ54T,Polystyrene microplastics alter the intestinal microbiota function and the hepatic metabolism status in marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma),"To assess the potential effects of microplastics (MPs) on gut microbiome, a simple investigation of gut microbial structure is not sufficient, and the function and association of gut microbial structure with host health should also be taken into account. Here, the effects of two particle sizes (2 and 200 ??m) of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) on the gut microbiota of medaka were evaluated following oral administration at 0.3 and 3.0 ??g/mg for 28 days. No change in body length and gut histopathology damage were observed. However, the exposure to PS-MPs significantly decreased fish body weight and disrupted the liver anti-oxidative status. The PS-MPs caused a shift in the gut microbial structure of medaka accompanied by changes in community function, including significant environmental stress, increased carbon degradation/fixation activities, and partially modified nitrogen/phosphorus/sulfur metabolic abilities. Furthermore, the PS-MPs exposure disturbed the glycolipid/tyrosine/energy metabolism and the endocrine balance. A potential correlation between the gut microecology and host response to PS-MPs exposure was also observed. These results indicated that the PS-MPs may contribute to gut-liver axis disruption, which could be the underlying toxicological mechanisms of PS-MPs exposure. This work has improved our knowledge about the relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and host metabolic disorders following MPs exposure. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
SLQD2HMT,Experimental study on the effects of glass fibres and expansive agent on the bond behaviour of glass/basalt FRP bars in seawater sea-sand concrete,"In seawater sea-sand concrete (SSSC), to avoid steel corrosion, the use of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars as reinforcement has been proposed. However, FRP bars do not have strong ribs for bonding, and thus, may have weaker bonds compared to steel reinforcing bars. To overcome this problem, the addition of fibres and expansive agent to concrete to induce gripping stresses on FRP bars may be a feasible solution. In this research, the effects of glass fibres and expansive agent on the bond behaviour of glass/basalt FRP bars cast in SSSC were studied by conducting pull-out tests with varying fibre content, fibre length, and expansive agent content. The results revealed that although the addition of glass fibres and/or the expansive agent significantly increases the bond stiffness, it only marginally increases the bond strength of the FRP bars. Overall, the addition of both fibres and the expansive agent offers certain synergistic effects; however, improving the bond strength is still difficult owing to the premature failure of the FRP bars. Finally, constitutive models to simulate the bond behaviour of FRP bars in SSSC were proposed. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
GDPXKATJ,How do microplastics affect the marine microbial loop? Predation of microplastics by microzooplankton,"Protozoans play an integral role in the microbial loop, an important process of material and energy transfer in marine ecosystems. The number of microplastics in the marine environment has greatly increased, but the potential impacts of small nanoplastics and microplastics on marine organisms remain unclear. Here, we conducted a series of feeding experiments with various concentrations of microplastic beads (ca. 1 ??m) to characterize the response of the planktonic ciliated protozoan Strombidium sulcatum to microplastics and a set of additional exposure experiments with four different particle diameters of microplastics to explore whether the feeding response exhibited size selectivity. As the microplastic concentration increased, the number, body size, and biomass of ciliates decreased sharply during the exposure period. Predator biomass in all microplastic treatments was markedly reduced relative to the microplastic-free control. For example, at 72 h of exposure, the biomass in the highest microplastic concentration treatment was observed to decrease by 96.59% relative to the control. There was no obvious difference in the biomass of ciliates exposed to various diameters of microplastics; however, compared with the free bead control, the biomass still significantly decreased. These findings suggest that microplastics in the ocean negatively affect the growth of protozoan microzooplankton that might have accidentally ingested these tiny particles during the feeding process. Generally, this study provides basic and novel data for understanding the effect of microplastics on the microbial loop in marine ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
QT6AME6Z,Does microplastic ingestion dramatically decrease the biomass of protozoa grazers? A case study on the marine ciliate Uronema marinum,"Microplastic debris has become a significant global environmental issue. Yet, the effects on ingestion of microplastics by protozoan grazers?????an important link in the microbial loop?????are scant. Feeding experiments were conducted with the free-living marine ciliate Uronema marinum grazing on cultured bacteria Pseudoaltermonas sp., exposing them to different concentrations or sizes of polystyrene beads for 96 h. The number of beads decreased during exposure experiments. Under the microplastic influence, the ciliate cells were observed to decrease in abundance, body size, and biomass. It was noted that the ciliate biomass in the highest microplastic density treatment was significantly lower than that in the control (98.1% lower) and that microplastics can be ingested by ciliate protozoa which performed an important role in the transportation of energy across the microbial loop. Moreover, carbon biomass of ciliates exposed to microplastics of different particle diameters decreased significantly compared to the control. However, this effect does not seem to vary depending on microplastic sizes. This study is a first step in providing experimental insight into the feeding relationship between microplastics and marine protozoan grazers. Further research based on components of the microbial loop is needed to explore the impacts of microplastics in marine food webs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
Z5TK78GJ,Isotope ratio mass spectrometry and spectroscopic techniques for microplastics characterization,"Micro- and nano-scale plastic particles in the environment result from their direct release and degradation of larger plastic debris. Relative to macro-sized plastics, these small particles are of special concern due to their potential impact on marine, freshwater, and terrestrial systems. While microplastic (MP) pollution has been widely studied in geographic regions globally, many questions remain about its origins. It is assumed that urban environments are the main contributors but systematic studies are lacking. The absence of standard methods to characterize and quantify MPs and smaller particles in environmental and biological matrices has hindered progress in understanding their geographic origins and sources, distribution, and impact. Hence, the development and standardization of methods is needed to establish the potential environmental and human health risks. In this study, we investigated stable carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), attenuated total reflectance - Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and micro-Raman spectroscopy (??-Raman) as complementary techniques for characterization of common plastics. Plastic items selected for comparative analysis included food packaging, containers, straws, and polymer pellets. The ability of IRMS to distinguish weathered samples was also investigated using the simulated weathering conditions of ultraviolet (UV) light and heat. Our IRMS results show a difference between the ??13C values for plant-derived and petroleum-based polymers. We also found differences between plastic items composed of the same polymer but from different countries, and between some recycled and nonrecycled plastics. Furthermore, increasing ??13C values were observed after exposure to UV light. The results of the three techniques, and their advantages and limitations, are discussed. ?? 2020",0
9A47RFNF,Sea-ice dynamics on triangular grids,"We present a discretization of the dynamics of sea-ice on triangular grids. Our numerical approach is based on the nonconforming Crouzeix-Raviart finite element. An advantage of this element is that it facilitates the coupling to an ocean model that employs an Arakawa C-type staggering of variables. We show that the Crouzeix-Raviart element implements a discretization of the viscous-plastic and elastic-viscous-plastic stress tensor that suffers from unacceptable small scale noise in the velocity field. To resolve this issue we introduce an edge-based stabilization of the Crouzeix-Raviart element. Through a blend of theoretical considerations, based on the Korn inequality, and numerical experiments we show that the stabilized Crouzeix-Raviart element provides a stable discretization of sea-ice dynamics on triangular grids that is relevant for sea-ice modelling in ocean and climate science. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",0
RY37K57X,An assessment of the concentration of pharmaceuticals adsorbed on microplastics,"In the last decade, microplastics (MPs) have become an increasing cause for concerning. These particles are scattered throughout seas and oceans and have the capability of transporting adsorbed pollutants as pharmaceutical compounds, which can cause toxic effects and be transferred along the food chain. The development, optimization and validation of a sensitive and reliable analytical procedure for the extraction and determination of ten common pharmaceuticals adsorbed on MPs is reported in this study. This method involves ultrasound-assisted extraction coupled with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. All of the variables included in the extraction process, such as the extraction time and type and solvent volume, were studied and optimised. Under optimal conditions, good reproducibility and repeatability, with relative standard deviations lower than 15% in most cases, were obtained while limits of detection between 0.25 and 15.8 ng g???1 were achieved. Last, the method was applied to the analysis of samples collected from beaches in the Canary Islands (Spain). The results indicated the presence of several analytes adsorbed on MPs in concentrations ranging from 34.0 to 111 ng g???1. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
HQZMXXR7,Microplastics in glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau: Evidence for the long-range transport of microplastics,"Microplastics are globally prevalent on a large scale in various marine and terrestrial environments, including Arctic snow and precipitation in protected areas of the United Sates. However, reports of microplastics from glaciers are rare, especially for the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is widely known as the world's Third Pole and Asian Water Tower. Adjacent to human settlements in South Asia, East China, and Central Asia, the TP features regular cross-border air pollution (e.g., black carbon and mercury), which can affect its vulnerable and pristine environments. In previous studies, abundant microplastics have been reported from Tibetan rivers/lakes water and sediments, and surface soils. We detected microplastics in glacier surface snow on the TP, which were isolated from the impact of human activities, indicating that microplastics can be transported over long distances. This evidence is expected to be significant for understanding the atmospheric transport of microplastics to the TP, and provides a global perspective on the microplastic cycle. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
TLVNX9IX,Pollution by anthropogenic microfibers in North-West Mediterranean Sea and efficiency of microfiber removal by a wastewater treatment plant,"The widespread pollution from the release of microfibers is an emerging concern as they are a potential threat to the environment. Their identification in samples in terms of quantity and pathways remain a challenge as contamination can be a major source of error. A systematic study of synthetic microfibers (MFs) has been carried out in different environmental compartments of an urban area and in the surface waters of the northwestern Mediterranean. The quantity, size and type of polymer of MFs were recorded in air, in waste water from a domestic washing machine, at the inlet and outlet of the Haliotis urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Nice (Provence Alpes C??te-d'Azur, France) and in a variety of coastal and offshore areas. The results showed that MFs released by clothes during washing (on average of 13 ?? 106 MFs per m3) are an important emitter of microplastics. Despite its high removal efficiency (87.5% to 98.5%) by Haliotis, a large number of MFs, estimated at 4.3 billion, enter the marine environment daily from the treatment plant. The attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) characterization of the raw materials showed that 14 to 50% of fibers are synthetic, mostly polyester and polyamide, the remaining 35 to 72% being natural polymers (cotton, wool) or manufactured by processing natural polymers (especially cellulose). MFs were found in all environmental compartments studied and appear to be widespread in coastal and offshore surface waters with concentrations varying from 2.6 ?? 103 to 3.70 ?? 104 m???3. The sources of MFs in the marine environment are multiple, with laundry fibers discharges from WWTP and the atmospheric transport of urban fibers are among the main pathways. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
5XJXJKX6,Geotechnical characterization of plastic waste materials in pavement subgrade applications,"Scarcity of traditional construction materials has motivated researchers to explore alternatives, and besides crushed glass, reclaimed asphalt pavement, and scrap tires, to name a few, plastic waste (unwanted or unusable plastic objects) has also gained attention in recent years. Plastic waste is traditionally re-used or recycled, but it often ends up as trash on curbsides, in landfills, or in our seas and oceans. The substantial amount of plastic waste produced annually worldwide, and its environmental repercussions are the rationale for exploring alternatives in order to recycle plastic waste into construction materials. This exploration can also benefit many industries and would help minimising adverse environmental impacts associated with dumping tones of plastic waste in landfills. Using plastic waste material with soil for soil reinforcement purposes has revealed some improvements in terms of strengths of materials, but nevertheless, this potentiality has not been fully assessed for different types and forms of plastic waste with natural subgrade soil in the road industry. In this paper, ground, flaky, and pelleted shapes of four sorted types of plastic waste from a recycling market were combined with silty or clayey gravel and sand soil of the A-2-7 AASHTO type. These plastic types are: low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), and polypropylene (PP) resins. Their various geotechnical properties have been assessed thoroughly. The investigation process entails assessing compaction, Californian Bearing Ratio (CBR), strength, resilient modulus, and permeability properties for both natural sub-grade soil and modified sub-grade soil with the aforementioned types of plastic waste. The results obtained show that the addition of plastic wastes decrease the maximum dry densities of the subgrade soils because of the lower relative density of the plastic material compared to the soil particles. It is also found that the addition of plastic wastes can increase or decrease the CBR and MR values of the subgrade. The nature of change (increase or decrease) and its magnitude are a function of the plastic content, shape and type. Permeability values of many subgrade soil samples increased with the addition of plastic waste, whereas the hydraulic conductivity of some soils modified with plastic remained unchanged. Subgrade soils with plastic had higher friction angle and lower compressive strength than plastic-free soils. The results of this research suggest that partial replacement of subgrade soil material with plastic waste may prove useful in road subgrade applications. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
KN9YLYH9,"Amount, distribution and composition of large microplastics in typical agricultural soils in Northern Germany","The pollution of the aquatic and terrestrial environment with plastics is a fast growing phenomenon with potential threats to the functioning of ecosystems and organisms therein as well as for human well-being. So far, research activities have mainly focused on the occurrence of microplastics (MP) in marine habitats, while little is known about their distribution and composition in the terrestrial environment. Agricultural practices such as fertilization, mulching or ensilage make agriculture a likely path for MP into the environment. Here, we collected soil samples at 15 farmland locations in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany, to study the amount, distribution and composition of MP in the size range between 1 and 5 mm. In total, 379 MP were identified in a total of 84 kg of dry weight (DW). Particle abundances in the sampling units ranged from 0 to 217.8 MP per kg DW with a mean abundance of 3.7 ?? 11.9 MP per kg DW (median: 0.0, interquartile range: 0.0?????4.9) per site. Although MP were found at all study sites, only 34% of the sampling units contained synthetic particles. Our data contribute to the establishment of a baseline on the amount, type and size of MP in farmland soils. Such a baseline is important for future monitoring schemes and for the development of more environmentally friendly management systems that reduce the input of MP into the agricultural system. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
YTJCJHQX,Application of embedded fibre Bragg grating sensors for structural health monitoring of complex composite structures for marine applications,"Fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) materials are recently widely applied in the marine industry. The high popularity of composites and safety requirements results in the development of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems. One of the sensors types that can be permanently integrated with a composite structure and used as a part of SHM system are fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Among FBG sensors advantages small size, high corrosion resistance, and absence of electric current are especially important in monitoring of composite marine structures. The paper presents an application of embedded FBG sensors arrays for evaluation of complex composite structure ????? a fast patrol boat. The experimental investigations contain spectra analyses for thin laminate sample (skin), a composite sandwich panel and fast patrol boat hull (sandwich structure). The quality of sensors spectra (before/after embedding and loading) was determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The relationship between strain and temperature in exploitation range was determined for laminate and sandwich structures. A linear relationship was achieved for both elements. The relationship for the sandwich panel was then applied during strain analyses of the boat composite hull. The utility of designed FBG sensors array for the panel was also verified by sensors responses on impact excitation in chosen points on the structure. The achieved results were then used during designing FBG sensors array embedded into the hull. FBG sensors spectra deformations due to fast patrol boat hull manufacturing process and exploitation as well as strain curves determined for the boat during tests at dry dock and at sea trials are analysed. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
NT3GQTHD,Fracture formation due to differential compaction under glacial load: a poro-elastoplastic simulation of the Hugin Fracture,"The Hugin Fracture, discovered in 2011, is an approximately 3.5 km long seafloor fracture in the North Sea. This fracture was unexpected and, due to the geology in the North Sea no obvious explanation could be found. In our study, we adopt the hypothesis that the Hugin fracture was formed by differential compaction controlled by glacial load. We construct a simplified 2D geomechanical model partly covered by top load (ice sheet) and test this hypothesis. We employ transient poro-elastoplastic simulation with a finite element method. For the simulations, we had to make assumptions regarding the material properties, because the fracture is located in-between well locations. We used descriptions from drilling site survey reports and literature values and performed seismic matching form well paths to the Hugin Fracture. Nearby well data were only partly useful due to incomplete logging in the first 400 m below seafloor. To overcome this problem, we introduced a mixing k-value which allows us to easily change the material properties from pure clay to sand. Changing the mixing k-value for each simulation provided information about the limits and robustness of the simulation results. Simulation results show isotropic stress and strain distribution in the horizontally layered, isotropic part of the model that is totally covered by the ice. In the central, channelized part of the model a composite stress and strain pattern develops with sub-vertical focus areas tangential to channel edges. Low stress, strain and deformation values under total load increase drastically soon after the load starts to decrease, resulting in the development of fractures along the focussed zones. Surface deformation such as formation of compaction ridges above stiff clay-filled channels and depression associated with plastic deformation is observed. A fracture and associated surface deformation develop above the shallowest sand-filled channel, very much resembling the observed geometry at the Hugin Fracture. The simulation supports the formation hypothesis for the Hugin Fracture as a compaction fracture and suggests that thin ice sheets may induce differential compaction to a depth of several hundred meters. ?? 2021, The Author(s).",0
LAN2XNED,Crashworthiness of circular fiber reinforced plastic tubes filled with composite skeletons/aluminum foam under drop-weight impact loading,"Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) have shown great promise in the design of light-weight thin-walled energy absorbers. Herein, circular CFRP/GFRP hybrid tubes and tubes, reinforced with internal composite skeletons (XS and OS), were fabricated to further enhance the energy absorption capacities. The crashworthiness and failure pattern of reinforced structures were compared with the hollow and aluminum foam-filled composite tubes. Moreover, low-velocity drop-weight impact tests were carried out to investigate the effect of hybridization design and filler types on the energy dissipation mechanism under axial compression. The experimental results revealed that the hollow composite tubes collapsed in progressive and the impact energy was absorbed by the generation of cracks, fiber fracture and friction. Also, the GFRP tubes exhibited better crashworthiness than CFRP tubes under low velocity impact, which was different from the quasi-static compression conditions. In contrast to hollow counterparts, the mean crushing force (MCF) of foam-filled tubes was improved by approximately 40%, whereas the specific energy absorption (SEA) was reduced by 30% due to the low weight efficiency of the aluminum foam. The filling of XS-skeleton divided the tube into four cells and improved the MCF by more than 10%. However, it reduced the SEA by around 8% due to unstable and inefficient deformation of XS-skeleton during crushing. By contrast, the OS-skeleton divided the hollow tube into more cells and collapsed progressively, resulting in superior energy absorption characteristics. Herein, the OS-filled GFRP tube was found to be the most crashworthy structure that improved the crushing force efficiency (CFE) and SEA by 50% and 7%, respectively. ?? 2020",0
AUB2AFDF,Effect of Salt Composition and Microstructure on Stress Corrosion Cracking of 316L Austenitic Stainless Steel for Dry Storage Canisters,"The atmospheric SCC/pitting susceptibility of deposited MgCl2, synthetic sea-salt and site-specific sea-salt (containing ammonium and nitrate ions) on weld, HAZ and base 316L canister material was investigated. Higher SCC/pitting densities were observed for the HAZ region exposed to MgCl2, due to higher tensile residual stresses and plastic strains. Pitting in the weld region exposed to MgCl2 show preferential corrosion of ??-ferrite. Salt composition appears to have had a significant impact on SCC, pitting density and surface corrosion behaviour. Maximum surface crack propagation rates in the HAZ of ??? 4 ?? 10???11 ms???1 were obtained for both synthetic sea-salt and MgCl2. ?? 2020",0
ALG5EPAC,Experimental investigation of the quasi-static and dynamic axial crushing behavior of carbon/glass epoxy hybrid composite tubes,"The energy absorption characteristics of fiber-reinforced composite tubes subjected to axial quasi-static and dynamic crushing were investigated in this research. The influences of fiber volume proportion, ply angle, and loading rate on the specific energy absorption (SEA) were discussed. The SEA of satin weave/carbon unidirectional tape hybrid tubes was more pronounced compared with that of glass weave/carbon unidirectional tape tubes in quasi-static and dynamic tests. The SEA of both tubes was rate insensitive in dynamic tests (7.2 m/s, 10.2 m/s), but the rate effect was remarkable under quasi-static loading (10 mm/min, 600 mm/min). For glass weave of 759/5224 tubes, and carbon unidirectional tapes of G827/5224 tubes with different ply angles and loading rates, the 759/5224 tube shows superior energy absorption capability, and the loading rate effect was observed in quasi-static loading. Finally, the highest mean-load and SEA were obtained when the 759 glass fiber ply angle was equal to 30??, while the lowest energy absorption was observed when the orientation of the 759 fiber plies was ??45??. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
LHYUFPJ3,On energy-absorbing mechanisms and structural crashworthiness of laterally crushed thin-walled structures filled with aluminum foam and CFRP skeleton,"In the present study, thin-walled tubes filled with aluminum foam and CFRP skeleton (FCFTs) are developed and manufactured based on a multiple material system. The structural crashworthiness of the proposed design is investigated under quasi-static lateral loading. Further, the aluminum tube, the foam-filled tube and the tubes filled with CFRP skeleton are also designed and tested to perform a comparative study. It is found that the FCFT-1 (the tube filled with foam and CFRP skeleton with square cells) exhibits superior SEA (specific energy absorption), which is almost five times that of the individual aluminum tube, and almost 10% higher than that of the foam-filled tube. However, FCFT-2 (the tube filled with foam and CFRP skeleton with triangular cells) provides relatively lower energy-absorbing capacity, as its aluminum tube generates several axial cracks during crushing process leading to low deformation level of the foams. Furthermore, crush simulations are conducted to better understand the energy-absorbing mechanisms of the FCFT-1. The numerical results demonstrate that the plastic deformation of the separated foams makes up the major part of the total energy absorption. Besides, the performance improvement of FCFT-1 can be partly attributed to the fact that the separated foams generate larger plastic deformation during crushing process. Apart from this, the increased interaction effects between the separated foams and the CFRP skeleton lead to a higher FE (frictional energy), which also makes a slight contribution to the performance improvement of FCFT-1. Finally, parametric studies are performed to explore the influences of design parameters on the crashworthiness characteristics of FCFT-1. It is indicated that the energy-absorbing capacity can be slightly improved by raising cell number, proportion of 45?? layer or foam density. The present work is expected to provide some insights for researchers and engineers to design such structures for energy absorption applications. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
G83QS3M8,Bisphenol A interferes with first shell formation and development of the serotoninergic system in early larval stages of Mytilus galloprovincialis,"Bisphenol A-BPA, a widespread plastic additive, is an emerging contaminant of high concern and a potential endocrine disruptor in mammals. BPA also represents a potential threat for aquatic species, especially for larval stages. In the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis, BPA has been previously shown to affect early larval development and gene transcription. In this work, the effects of BPA (0.05?????0.5?????5 ??M) were further investigated at different times post fertilization (24?????28?????32?????48 hpf). BPA induced concentration-dependent alterations in deposition of the organic matrix and calcified shell at different larval stages, as shown by double calcofluor/calcein staining, resulting in altered phenotypes at 48hpf. Transcription of Tyrosinase-TYR, that plays a key role in remodelling of the shell organic matrix, and of HOX1, a member of homeobox genes involved in larval shell formation and neurogenesis, were evaluated by In Situ Hybrydization-ISH. BPA altered the spatial pattern of expression of both genes, with distinct effects depending on the concentration and developmental stage. Moreover, BPA affected the time course of mRNA levels for TYR from 24 to 48hpf. BPA impaired development of serotonin-5-HT-immunoreactive neurons at different times pf; at 48hpf, the reduction in the number of serotoninergic neurons was associated with developmental delay and downregulation of the 5-HT receptor-5-HTR. All the effects were observed from the lowest concentration tested, corresponding to detectable BPA levels in contaminated coastal waters. These data demonstrate that BPA interferes with key processes occurring during the first developmental stages of mussels, thus representing a potential threat for natural populations. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
GLQNP9F9,"Facies, sequence framework, and reservoir quality along a Triassic carbonate ramp: Kangan Formation, South Pars Field, Persian Gulf Superbasin","The Lower Triassic Kangan Formation of the Persian Gulf Superbasin forms one of the largest reservoirs in the South Pars/North Field, the world's largest gas field. The upper Khuff-equivalent, gas-hosting carbonate-evaporite succession was formed on a gently-sloping, homoclinal carbonate ramp in a warm, tropical aragonite sea under a hot-and-arid greenhouse climate. This study explores the impact of vertical variations in depositional facies and diagenetic features on the reservoir quality to improve the prediction of the subsurface facies and hydraulic flow unit distribution. Detailed core logging and petrographic analysis resulted in the recognition of twelve distinct carbonate-evaporite facies that are grouped into four major facies associations, from shallowest to deepest: supratidal to restricted subtidal, lagoon, carbonate shoal, and shallow mid-ramp. The facies associations are stacked into two long-term sequences KS2 (58 m) and KS1 (77 m) bounded by anhydrites and/or unconformities; three higher frequency sequences (KS1a, KS1b, and KS1c) can be identified within the KS1. Based on the petrophysical properties, sedimentary facies characteristics and their diagenetic modifications, five hydraulic flow units (HFUs) are identified, with the best porosity-permeability values and flow- and storage capacities in the late transgressive (TSTs) and the earliest highstand systems tracts (HSTs) of the two long-term sequences. The reservoir quality and the distribution of hydraulic flow units are a product of interactions between primary mineralogy, depositional facies and their stacking, and the early- and late-diagenetic alterations. The reservoir quality decreases in landward direction, being the lowest in the mud-supported textures of the lagoon and supratidal to restricted subtidal facies associations. The seaward improvement in reservoir quality reflects a change to grain-supported textures that formed along the tide-and wave-agitated ooid-bioclastic shoals, whereas the best reservoir quality characterizes the shallow mid-ramp open-marine facies association, where secondary porosity was improved by dissolution and dolomitization. Both the early and late diagenetic dolomitization overall improved the reservoir quality, with the dolomitization pathways controlled by the porosity and permeability heterogeneity in the original depositional facies. The results may be useful in reservoir modeling, recognition of the productive zones, and the further development of the South Pars/North Dome Field. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
XTA2PJVL,A probabilistic risk assessment of microplastics in soil ecosystems,"Plastics have a variety of applications due to their versatility, relative cost, and strength-to-weight ratio, and resistance to degradation. As a result, plastic waste can be found in all corners of the Earth. A class of plastic contaminants that have received increasing attention in terms of their potential impact on ecosystems is microplastics (???5 mm). The greatest attention to date has been on their potential effect in marine ecosystems. However, a growing number of studies are examining their potential impact on soil ecosystems. The data reported in the literature on the environmentally-relevant concentrations of microplastics in soils and the concentration of microplastics that causes an adverse effect in soil biota were used to perform a probabilistic risk assessment of microplastics to soil biota. An environmental exposure distribution was constructed from the concentrations of microplastics reported in soil in the literature. Species sensitivity distributions were constructed using concentration of microplastics in soil that had no adverse effect on soil species (NOEC) or the lowest concentrations that had an adverse effect on soil species (LOEC) reported in the literature. The 95th centile of the environmental exposure distribution (8147 microplastic particles per gram of soil) was greater than 22 and 28% of the species sensitivity distribution constructed using NOECs and LOECs, respectively. The assessment concluded that environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics reported in the literature could pose a considerable risk to soil biota. It is also important to note that due to the continued production of large quantities of plastic and the persistence of microplastics in the environment, environmentally-relevant concentrations of microplastics in soil are likely to only rise. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
QZXJRQWF,Plastics and sedimentation foster the spread of a non-native macroalga in seagrass meadows,"Plastics are found in marine environments worldwide, and their effects on macrophytes (seagrasses and macroalgae) colonizing sandy bottoms are still poorly known. Seagrass meadows are valuable but declining ecosystems due to local and global-change related stressors, including sediment disturbance and introduced macroalgae. Understanding whether plastics pose a further threat to seagrasses is critically important. In two simultaneous additive experiments performed in an aquaculture tank, we examined the individual and combined effects of macroplastics (non-biodegradable high-density polyethylene and biodegradable starch-based) and sedimentation (no and repeated sedimentation) on the performance (in terms of biomass and architectural variables) of a native Mediterranean seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) and an introduced macroalga (Caulerpa cylindracea), and on the intensity of their interactions. Macroplastics were still present in sediments after 18 months. Cymodocea nodosa produced a greater biomass and longer horizontal rhizome internodes forming clones with more spaced shoots probably to escape from plastics. Plastics prevented C. nodosa to react to sedimentation by increasing vertical rhizome growth. Under C. cylindracea invasion, C. nodosa allocated more biomass to roots, particularly to fine roots. In the presence of C. nodosa, C. cylindracea performance was reduced. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic and sedimentation shifted species interactions from competitive to neutral. These results suggest that both HDPE and biodegradable starch-based macroplastics, if deposited on marine bottoms, could make seagrasses vulnerable to sedimentation and reduce plant cover within meadows. HDPE plastic and sedimentation could contribute to the decline of seagrass habitats by facilitating the spread of non-native macroalgae within meadows. Overall, the study highlights the urgent need to implement more effective post-marketing management actions to prevent a further entering of plastics in natural environments in the future, as well as to establish to conservation measures specifically tailored to protect seagrass habitats from plastic pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
BBLAXLRM,"Micro-plastic pollution along the Bay of Bengal coastal stretch of Tamil Nadu, South India","In the present-day context, micro-plastic particles in a marine environment are increasingly ubiquitous and of considerable persistence. In line with the micro-plastic pollution, the present contribution is devoted to the investigation of micro-plastic particles (MPs) along the urban sandy beach called Marina, the renowned longest beach in India. Along the sea coast of about 5 km, the quantification of micro-plastic particles using optical microscope evidenced the granular, filamentous, filmy and tubular fragments in a total of 72 marine samples including those filtered in the marine water column (WAT; 24 samples), those found in wet sediment (WET; 24 samples) and those found in dry sand (DSS; 24 samples). The filamentous-typed plastics of 79%, 57% and 52%, respectively in WET, WAT and DSS dominated over the other granular and tubular types. The micro-plastic particles were in the range of 60?????820 items per m3, 60?????1620 items per kg and 20?????1540 items per kg for WAT, WET and DSS, respectively. The standard deviation for the microplastics abundance were 193.1, 396.6 and 364.6 for WAT, WET and DSS respectively. Upon visual inspection, the micro particles were observed in eight different colors and most of the samples were found to contain two different fragment types. Apart from the optical microscopic examination, the micro-plastics particles were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with elemental analysis by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The energy spectral graphs displayed that the micro-filaments and micro-tubular particles contained polyesters and fluoro-polymers. The presence of few micro-filaments of polypropylene and polyethylene was also evidenced from their atomic percentage values of carbon of about 88% and 93%, respectively. The presence of fluoro-polymers and polyesters was also confirmed by Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR). Excepting the fluoro-polymers, the micro-plastics particles contained elements arising from sea water (Na, Cl, S, Mg, Ca, K). Heavy metals such as Cu, Mn, Mo, Ru and Rh were observed in micro-tubular fragments. Fe and Ti elements were detected with the highest atomic percentage of 17.19 and 19.84 in micro-tubular fragments. All the observations and analyses give a photography of the nature and the spatial distribution of MPs along this Indian beach. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
YRJG3PWG,Biodegradable plastics can alter carbon and nitrogen cycles to a greater extent than conventional plastics in marine sediment,"The seabed constitutes a global sink for plastic debris, where they can remain for centuries. Biodegradable plastics offer the advantage of having less persistence in the environment than conventional ones. The seabed is responsible for key ecosystem functions related to the cycling of elements by decomposing the labile fraction of organic matter and fueling primary production, while storing the most recalcitrant part of this organic matter and limiting CO2 emissions. Although plastics are expected to affect these processes, knowledge on this matter is scarce. In controlled microcosms, we show that biodegradable plastics can stimulate the decomposition of marine-buried carbon and reduce the release of inorganic nitrogen. We found that conventional and biodegradable plastics promoted anaerobic sediment metabolic pathways. Biodegradable plastics produced a two-fold CO2 release to the water column, which suggests the decomposition of not only plastics, but also of buried organic carbon. The stimulation of sediment metabolism could be due to excessive carbon consumption by bacteria that derives from a rise in the carbon:nitrogen ratio. Accordingly, the NH4+ flux to the water column lowered. As NOx fluxes also lowered, biodegradable plastics might promote nitrification-denitrification coupling. If biodegradable plastics become a major component of marine pollution, then sediment biogeochemical cycles might be strongly influenced, which could affect the carbon sequestration of coastal ecosystems and compromise their mitigation capacity against climate change. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
9S2A6MNT,Riverine plastic pollution from fisheries: Insights from the Ganges River system,"Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear represents a substantial proportion of global marine plastic pollution and can cause significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. Yet little is known about its presence in, and implications for, freshwater ecosystems or its downstream contribution to plastic pollution in the ocean. This study documents fishing gear-related debris in one of the world's largest plastic pollution contributing river catchments, the Ganges. Riverbank surveys conducted along the length of the river, from the coast in Bangladesh to the Himalaya in India, show that derelict fishing gear density increases with proximity to the sea. Fishing nets were the main gear type by volume and all samples examined for polymer type were plastic. Illegal gear types and restricted net mesh sizes were also recorded. Socio-economic surveys of fisher communities explored the behavioural drivers of plastic waste input from one of the world's largest inland fisheries and revealed short gear lifespans and high turnover rates, lack of appropriate end-of-life gear disposal methods and ineffective fisheries regulations. A biodiversity threat assessment identified the air-breathing aquatic vertebrate species most at risk of entanglement in, and impacts from, derelict fishing gear; namely species of threatened freshwater turtle and otter, and the endangered Ganges river dolphin. This research demonstrates a need for targeted and practical interventions to limit the input of fisheries-related plastic pollution to this major river system and ultimately, the global ocean. The approach used in this study could be replicated to examine the inputs, socio-economic drivers and ecological impacts of this previously uncharacterised but important source of plastic pollution in other major rivers worldwide. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
BQYUJKAV,"The occurrence and abundance of microplastics in surface water and sediment of the West River downstream, in the south of China","Microplastic pollution has aroused great concern in inland waters. Freshwater is the transport routes and potential sources for plastic fragments to the oceans. However, information especially about the occurrence of microplastics in freshwater systems is unclear in certain key areas. This work studied the distribution and characteristics for microplastics in the downstream area of West River. Both sediment and surface water detected microplastics with abundance ranging from 2560 to 10,240 items/kg and 2.99 to 9.87 items/L, respectively. Small size (<0.5 mm) and fiber were the main size and type in both surface waters and sediments. Polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate were the polymer types of microplastics, as identified using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. In addition, findings here might be in consideration of studying about the distribution of microplastics and the degree to which they were influenced by the use of land. In descending order, the highest microplastics abundance was observed in commercial/public/recreational > residential > industrial > natural areas. Our results indicate the occurrence of high abundance microplastics in river impacted by human activities, and suggest that spatial distribution of microplastics varies between different land use areas. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
EEHLGTAY,Preparation and antifouling performance evaluation of fluorine-containing amphiphilic silica nanoparticles,"Ocean-going ships, deep-sea equipment, coastal facilities, and other underwater surfaces are often attached to and fouled by marine microorganisms, animals, and plants, leading to damage, equipment failure or major economic losses in severe cases. Therefore, it is of great significance to take measures to prevent marine biofouling. To date, no single eco-friendly technology has been developed to achieve good antifouling effects. Therefore, the combination of multiple antifouling factors is still one of the main strategies to strengthen antibiofouling performance. In this paper, amphiphilic block copolymer (PTFEMA-co-PSBMA) functionalized silica (SiO2) nanoparticles of SiO2-g-(PTFEMA-co-PSBMA) were prepared by surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP), and then they were physically blended with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix to prepare one kind of novel antifouling coating. Compared with control silicone rubber coating and bare SiO2-dopped silicone rubber coating, the experiment results show that the diatom density on the surface of the copolymer functionalized silica nanoparticle-dopped coating is reduced by approximately 30 % and 50 %, respectively. Furthermore, upon employing washing process, it is found that the highest removal rate of diatoms on the surface of the copolymer functionalized silica nanoparticle coating is 50 %, which is approximately twice the removal rate of the unmodified SiO2 silicone rubber coating. Finally, it is found that the surface of the copolymer functionalized silica nanoparticle coating still has good antifouling and fouling release properties upon encountering wear test. These above results prove that the coatings with functionalized nanosilica nanoparticles have better antifouling performance. Current strategy in this work provides a new route for developing environmentally friendly fouling-releasing antifouling coatings. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
M2IL4EGW,Physiological effects of plastic particles on mussels are mediated by food presence,"Plastic particles cause toxic effects on marine organisms but whether food particles can affect the toxic effects of plastic particles on filter feeding animals remains unknown. To evaluate the intake and physiological effects of different size particles and their exposure ways, the thick shell mussels Mytilus coruscus were exposed to polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics (NPs, 70 nm) and microplastics (MPs, 10 ??m) respectively for two weeks by mixing NPs/MPs with microalgae or exposed to MNPs individually after feeding. Intake of particles and their physiological effects including energy budget, digestive enzymes and oxidative responses were assessed after exposure. Results indicated food presence mediate the effects while MPs decrease the energy budget and increase the catalase activity and malondialdehyde levels. Moreover, exposure way significantly affected energy budget and size of particle had a significant impact on enzyme activities. Our results showed MPs induce more significant effects than NPs on mussels, emphasized the importance of particle exposure way and suggested that mixture exposure with microalgae alleviate the influences on mussels caused by plastic particles alone. This study emphasized that we need to take the food particles into account for evaluating the toxic effects of plastic particles on filter feeding animals in the natural environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
YT72ZYZH,Differential enrichment and physiological impacts of ingested microplastics in scleractinian corals in situ,"Microplastics are emerging contaminants and widespread in the ocean, but their impacts on coral reef ecosystems are poorly understood, and in situ study is still lacking. In the present study, the distribution patterns of microplastics in the environment and inhabiting organisms were investigated along the east coast of Hainan Island, South China Sea, and the physiological impacts of the microplastics on scleractinian corals were analyzed. We documented average microplastic concentrations of 14.90 particles L???1 in seawater, 343.04 particles kg???1 in sediment, 4.97 particles cm???2 in corals, and 0.67?????3.12 particles cm???1 in Tridacnidae, Trochidae and fish intestines. Further analysis revealed that the characteristics of microplastics in the organisms were different from those in the environment, indicating preferential enrichment in the organisms. Furthermore, there was an obvious correlation between microplastic concentration and symbiotic density in corals. Furthermore, caspase3 activity was significantly positively correlated with the microplastic content in the small-polyp coral Pocillopora damicornis, but the large-polyp coral Galaxea fascicularis showed higher tolerance to microplastics. Taken together, our results suggest that microplastics are selectively enriched in corals and other reef-dwellers, in which they exact differential stress (apoptotic) effects, with the potential to impact the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis and alter the coral community structure. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
4CPEAUSP,Screening of suspected micro(nano)plastics in the Ebro Delta (Mediterranean Sea),"This is the first work reporting the use of a double suspect-screening to assess most common polymers and additives in micro(nano)plastics (NPLs/MPLs) found in environmental waters. The method consisted of water filtration followed by ultrasonic-assisted extraction with toluene and analysis employing size exclusion chromatography using an advanced polymer chromatography column coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry with an atmospheric pressure photoionisation source by negative ionisation conditions (LC(APC)-APPI(???)-HRMS). The identification of NPL/MPLs polymers has been based on increasing confirmation level, including the monomers characterisation by the Kendrick Mass Defect and confirmation and quantification when standards were available. In parallel, the identification of main additives in NPL/MPLs composition, as well organic contaminants adsorbed onto the plastic particles were carried out by analysis of the extracts by LC(C18)-APPI (+/???)-HRMS. To assess the impact of plastic pollution it is necessary to assess the composition in terms of polymers but also the additives. This screening approach has been employed to study composition of NPL/MPLs in the Ebro Delta. Two sampling campaigns including freshwater and seawater samples have been investigated to assess plastic composition in the top 5 cm. Polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polyisoprene (PI), polybutadiene (PBD), polypropylene (PP) and polysiloxanes were the most detected polymers and PP and PE, sizing between < 1000 and 2000 Da, were found at concentrations reaching up to 7000 ng/L in some areas. The pentadecanoic acid, 1,2,3-benzotriazoles, 2-ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA), and phthalates such as dimethyl phthalate, mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and the phthalimide were more frequently detected plastic additives. Finally, series of organic contaminants were as well detected in the particulate fraction. These organic contaminants cannot be associated to plastic compositions but can be associated to their adsorption to the particulate matter, in particular to NPL/MPLs, due to their non-polar character. Among these organic contaminants, the more frequently detected were pharmaceutical compounds, food additives and pesticides. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
JD2XD3HF,"Microplastics and other anthropogenic particles are prevalent in mussels from San Francisco Bay, and show no correlation with PAHs","Microplastics are an emerging contaminant of high environmental concern due to their widespread distribution and availability to aquatic organisms. Filter-feeding organisms like bivalves have been identified as particularly susceptible to microplastics, and because of this, it has been suggested bivalves could be useful bioindicators of microplastic pollution in ecosystems. We sampled resident mussels and clams from five sites within San Francisco Bay for microplastics and other anthropogenic microparticles. Cages of depurated mussels (denoted transplants) were also deployed at four sites in the Bay for 90 days to investigate temporal uptake of microplastics and microparticles. Because microplastics can sorb PAHs, and thus may act as a source of these chemicals upon ingestion, transplant mussels and resident clams were also analyzed for PAHs. We found anthropogenic microparticles in all samples at all sites, some of which were identified as microplastics. There was no statistical difference between the mean number of microparticles found in resident and transplant species. There were significant site-specific differences among microparticle abundances in the Bay, with the highest abundances observed in the South Bay. No correlation was found between the number of microparticles and the sum concentrations of PAHs, priority PAHs, or any individual PAH, suggesting the chemical concentrations observed reflect broader chemical trends in the Bay rather than direct exposure through microplastic ingestion. The pattern of spatial distribution of microparticles in transplanted mussels matched that of sediment samples from the Bay, suggesting bivalves could be a useful bioindicator of microplastic abundances in sediment, but not surface water. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
LHLW2L8X,Current situation and key challenges on the use of single-use plastic in Hanoi,"Marine plastic litter, mostly comprising single-use plastics, has been recognised as one of the world's most urgent environmental concerns, and Vietnam has been ranked as one of the top five countries polluting the ocean with plastic waste. This paper examines Hanoi as a case study on single-use plastic by households, investigating the daily generation of single-use plastic waste through a survey, assessing existing policy gaps through a policy review, and providing recommendations on improving management along the supply chain in Vietnam. At almost 27 times a week on average, plastic shopping bags were found to be the most prevalent single-use plastic used by households, followed by wrap/film, straws, coffee cups with plastic lids, cutlery, takeout containers, food packaging, party cups, bottles for water and beverages, and other items. Plastic shopping bags and food packaging are used more often in rural areas than in urban areas. These bags also have a high rate (68.65%) of temporary reuse as kitchen bin liners, a habit that may be difficult to change over the short term. Apart from some components of plastic bottles and packaging that are sold for recycling, most single-use plastic waste is disposed in landfills. Policies are in place to address plastic issues, such as a tax on plastic bags and source separation, but implementation is inconsistent. A behaviour-based combination of top-town and bottom-up approaches along the entire supply chain is recommended to improve existing policy gaps in Vietnam. ?? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",0
TQRIYB5M,Transport and fate of microplastics from riverine sediment dredge piles: Implications for disposal,"Microplastics (MPs) are an environmental problem of growing concern. Aquatic sediments are considered as a final sink for MPs, but dredging can remobilize sedimentary MPs into both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Although dredging is globally used for waterway deepening and ecological restoration, the environmental impacts of dredging on MP pollutants has not been previously assessed. In this study, Nile Red staining combined with micro-FTIR methods showed sediments containing high MP concentrations (6060?????37610 n/kg??DW) from urban/suburban segments of a plain river network in Southeast China. The dredged sediments were stored in piles on farmlands, whereby MPs were subsequently dispersed to surrounding soils and surface waters while awaiting a permanent disposal option. MP concentrations in the soils surrounding the pile were higher in the dry season (wind dispersion), while MP concentrations in waters downstream of the piles were higher in the wet season (rainfall/runoff erosion). Whether dredge sediments are finally used to fertilize farmland, as fill material for coastal land reclamation or dumped into the ocean, MPs have the potential for remobilization into the environment causing concerns with aquatic food webs, agricultural production and human health. Therefore, disposal of dredge sediments containing MPs requires careful assessment to minimize potential environmental impacts. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
G6MYC5CL,Critical effect of iron red pigment on photoaging behavior of polypropylene microplastics in artificial seawater,"Microplastics (MPs) containing chemical additives undergo extensive aging in the environment, but the effect of additives on aging behavior of MPs is not fully understood. This study evaluated the effects of iron red pigment on the photoaging behavior of polypropylene (PP) MPs and the release kinetics of Fe(II) and Fe(III) under simulated sunlight. Based on analyses in surface property and aging products of leachate, the incorporated iron red pigment significantly decreased the photoaging rate of PP MPs. The critical effect mainly depended on the light shielding and the competition of pigment for electrons and reactive oxygen species generated from irradiated MPs. Light irradiation also caused the production of homologous series of organic products containing dicarboxylic acid end groups. Moreover, aging of pigmented MPs enhanced the release of Fe ions in leachates, and the types of released iron ions were different between dark and light conditions, where the iron ion in dark system was mainly as Fe(III), while Fe(II) was the dominant form in light irradiation, since the released Fe(III) reacted with MP-derived organic acids and reactive oxygen species in light condition. The findings highlight the critical role of inorganic pigments in the environmental fate and risk of MPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
IJWAU7SG,An experimental study on low velocity impact performance of bolted composite joints part 1: Influence of halloysite nanotubes on dynamic loading response,"Mechanical joints are a widely utilized to assembly fiber reinforced polymer composites in marine applications. Impact is one of the most encountered unpredictable loading types which significantly diminishes the mechanical properties of structures. The goal of this study is to investigate the dynamic loading response of bolted basalt-epoxy composite laminates under different impact energies. Unlike the existing low velocity impact tests of bolted composite joints, to reveal the effect of localized impact damage, the low-velocity impact tests were conducted on two different regions as the top of bolt (ToB) and the side of washer (SoW). In addition, the effects of HNTs reinforcement on the impact response and the damage propagation were also evaluated. It was obtained that ToB damage was comparatively severe for the composite joints due to the propagation of the damage through the hole center. Moreover, HNTs improved the impact resistance about %15, especially at lower impact energies. However, the nanoreinforcement efficiency diminished with increasing impact energy levels. The obtained results were further supported with macro-size images and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Together with Part II, this study reports an extensive work of impact tests of bolted composite joints utilized in the marine industry. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
5VTF8IAH,Crashworthiness study of circular tubes subjected to radial extrusion under quasi-static loading,"A structure of circular tubes subjected to radial extrusion with variable geometrical configurations was analysed. In a quasi-static experiment, axial grooves were produced on the circular aluminium tube under the action of indenters, without buckling instability. The energy was absorbed by plastic deformation of the aluminium tube and friction between parts. Deformation and driving force?????displacement responses of the circular tube were analysed by way of numerical simulation, which matched the experimental results. Based on the validated finite element (FE) model, the effects of different geometrical configurations on structural crashworthiness were analysed. The results showed that, throughout the deformation stage, a lag was found in force changes in response to the increasing spacing between the aluminium tube and a rib plate and decreasing inclination angle of the indenter. The plastic energy ratio exceeded 60%. The specific energy absorption (SEA) was separately improved by 59.11%, 265.10%, and 75.00% with the increase of the inclination angle and number of the indenters and the decrease of the distance between the indenter and the centre of the tube. The increase in width of the rib plate could not significantly enhance energy absorption effects in the structure. In addition, by utilising the complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) method, it was found that the aluminium tube T3.5 (with wall thickness T of 3.5 mm) exhibited the optimal structural configuration and the best crashworthiness. In conclusion, the use of thin-walled tubes subjected to radial extrusion provide a reference for the development of new energy absorbers. ?? 2020",0
VRAWQ82E,"Surveillance of plasticizers, bisphenol A, steroids and caffeine in surface water of River Ganga and Sundarban wetland along the Bay of Bengal: occurrence, sources, estrogenicity screening and ecotoxicological risk assessment","The transboundary River Ganga serves as a conduit for meltwater from the Himalayas and is a major freshwater source for two thirds of Indian population before emptying into the Sundarban Delta, the largest estuary in the Bay of Bengal. Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) such as phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and bisphenol A (BPA) used as organic plastic additives can pollute the aquatic environment receiving plastic litter. Hence, we have investigated these EDCs in water samples from Ganga and Sundarban wetland of India. Since these compounds exhibit estrogenic potential, we have further measured steroids and evaluated the estrogenic activity (estradiol equivalents, BioE2Eqs) using an in-vitro bioassay (E-Screen). Further BioE2Eqs were compared with the sum of predicted estradiol equivalents based on the chemical concentrations of PAEs and BPA by E-Screen (ChemE2Eq) and YES factors (ChemYES). Caffeine was measured as a marker for anthropogenic wastewater discharge. Results showed that the highest BioE2Eq (below the lowest observable effect of E2 on fish) was associated with sites having sewer outfalls in the middle stretch of the river, and concomitantly coinciding with the elevated concentrations of caffeine. Neither ChemE2Eq nor ChemYES correlated with measured BioE2Eqs. River concentrations of BPA (0.04?????4.46 ??g/L) and ???7plasticizers (0.43?????7.63 ??g/L) were higher than BPA (0.21?????2.82 ??g/L) and ???7plasticizers (0.85?????2 ??g/L) in the Sundarban wetland. The only steroids detected were androgens, found at four sites in Ganga (0.007 ??g/L?? 0.003, mean ?? S.D.). The highest estimated ecotoxicological risk to aquatic insect and fish stemmed from BPA. A secondary effect, and a potential impact on human health could be reflected via fish consumption from the productive fisheries region along the lower stretch of River Ganga. Identification of areas of elevated estrogenicity, plasticizer and steroid concentrations in River Ganga can be used to design and implement interventions for the remediation of such emerging contaminants. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
WLRA7CGV,Multiscale mechanical performance and corrosion behaviour of plasma sprayed AlCoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy coatings,"The combination of technical advantages of high entropy alloys (HEAs) and manufacturing capabilities of thermal spray (TS) offer potential towards new protective coatings to address extreme engineering environments. In this research, equi-atomic AlCoCrFeNi HEA coatings were synthesized via atmospheric plasma spray (APS) using mechanically alloyed feedstock, and a correlation between microstructure and mechanical properties in terms of both hardness and wear were established at multiscale levels. In addition, electrochemical performance in sea water and the overall residual stress distribution in the HEA coatings were also assessed. Superimposition of scanning electron micrographs and statistically analysed heat and contour maps using nanoindentation datasets revealed deviations in localized properties within and across individual phases; which were supported by Weibull plots of individual phases. Scanning wear tests revealed superior nanowear resistance of oxide phases developed by in-flight oxidation during APS process. In comparison, the HEA phases in the coating exhibited significant localized plastic deformation. The outcome of macroscale wear testing postulated that plasma sprayed AlCoCrFeNi HEA coatings exhibited superior wear resistance at high temperature (500 ??C) than at room temperature, signifying high thermal stability of the coating. Residual stress generated due to plasma spray was measured using neutron diffraction and was tensile in nature. The corrosion resistance of the coating was slightly lower than that of SS316L, however, the anodic and cathodic polarization behaviour of HEA coating were identical to that of SS316L, indicating that the AlCoCrFeNi-based HEAs have prospects as corrosion resistant materials. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
BWR7G8L9,Investigation of the performance of asphalt binder modified by sargassum,"Permanent deformations (rutting) are the most frequent problem throughout the world in the design of heavy- traffic pavement roads, which is a consequence of the accumulation of small amounts of plastic deformations occurring whenever a load is applied on the asphalt. This problem arises when the asphalt binders are prepared from hot asphalt mixtures. For this reason, asphalt modifiers are used to minimize failures, avoiding both permanent deformations and the subsequent cracks appearing on the pavements. In this study, seaweed Sargassum (SGZ) was used for the first time as a modifier of asphalt binders, as a response to the urgent need of finding a way to handle and take advantage of the massive amounts of this biomass, which has been found in recent years on the beach coasts of the equatorial Atlantic Ocean forming what the authors call the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt. The rheological properties of these asphalt binders were evaluated by means of a DSR (dynamic shear rheometer) equipment; the results showed that the addition of sargassum at different concentrations (0.5?????4% wt) increased the permanent deformation factor (G*/sin??), and that higher elastic behavior is reached on the 2.5% SGZ sample. Additionally, the thermal resistance towards high temperatures was identified and compared with the control sample, observing the best results on the SGZ 2.5% sample. This behavior was confirmed by the calculation of the penetration index (PI). Moreover, the thermal stability test was efficient for demonstrating an improvement of the compatibility between the sargassum and the asphalt caused by a reduction in the difference between their densities. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
C66C8I92,"Pelagic microplastics in surface water of the Eastern Indian Ocean during monsoon transition period: Abundance, distribution, and characteristics","Microplastics (MPs) have been documented in almost all marine environments, including coastal regions, the open ocean, and the deep sea. However, relatively little knowledge was available about MP pollution in the open ocean, especially the Indian Ocean. We conducted field observations at 36 stations in the Eastern Indian Ocean (EIO), using a typical manta trawl with a mesh size of 330 ??m for surface water sampling. Ours is the first study to obtained comprehensive and comparable baseline data about MPs in the EIO, including abundance, spatial distribution and characteristics. Abundance of MPs in the EIO varied from 0.01 items m???2 to 4.53 items m???2, with an average concentration of 0.34 ?? 0.80 item m???2. The mean concentration of MPs in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) was 2.04 ?? 2.26 items m???2 and 0.16 ?? 0.17 items m???2 in the open ocean of the EIO. These results illustrate the high spatial heterogeneity of MPs distribution. Micro-FTIR analysis of polymer composition showed that the vast majority of MPs consisted of polypropylene (PP, 51.11%) and polyethylene (PE, 20.07%). Our data show that MP pollution in the EIO, whether in the epeiric sea or the open ocean, is among the highest of the world's oceans. The BoB is likely to become a MP hotspot due to the vast input of land-based plastics and the presence of multiscale recirculation gyres. These results are absolutely thought provoking: The EIO needs more attention on MPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
9D22F7WB,Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon sorption and bacterial community composition of biodegradable and conventional plastics incubated in coastal sediments,"Resistant to degradation, plastic litter poses a long-term threat to marine ecosystems. Biodegradable materials have been developed to replace conventional plastics, but little is known of their impacts and degradation in marine environments. A 14-week laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the sorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to conventional (polystyrene PS and polyamide PA) and bio-based, biodegradable plastic films (cellulose acetate CA and poly-L-lactic acid PLLA), and to examine the composition of bacterial communities colonizing these materials. Mesoplastics (1 cm2) of these materials were incubated in sediment and seawater collected from two sites in the Gulf of Finland, on the coast of the highly urbanized area of Helsinki, Finland. PS sorbed more PAHs than did the other plastic types at both sites, and the concentration of PAHs was consistently and considerably smaller in plastics than in the sediment. In general, the plastic bacterial biofilms resembled those in the surrounding media (water and/or sediment). However, in the sediment incubations, the community composition on CA diverged from that of the other three plastic types and was enriched with Bacteroidia and potentially cellulolytic Spirochaetia at both sites. The results indicate that certain biodegradable plastics, such as CA, may harbour potential bioplastic-degrading communities and that PAH sorption capacity varies between polymer types. Since biodegradable plastics are presented as replacements for conventional plastics in applications with risk of ending up in the marine environment, the results highlight the need to carefully examine the environmental behaviour of each biodegradable plastic type before they are extensively introduced to the market. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",0
VIIXVWI7,UV degradation of natural and synthetic microfibers causes fragmentation and release of polymer degradation products and chemical additives,"A high proportion of the total microplastic (MP) load in the marine environment has been identified as microfibers (MFs), with polyester (PET) and polyamide (PA) typically found in the highest abundance. The potential for negative environmental impacts from MPs may be dependent on their degree of degradation in the environment, which is influenced by both intrinsic properties (polymer type, density, size, additive chemicals) and extrinsic environmental parameters. Most polymer products break down slowly through a combination of environmental processes, but UV degradation can be a significant source of degradation. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of UV irradiance on the degradation of natural (wool) and synthetic (PET and PA) MFs. Degradation of MFs was conducted in seawater under environmentally relevant accelerated exposure conditions using simulated sunlight. After 56 days of UV exposure, PA primarily exhibited changes in surface morphology with no significant fragmentation observed. PET and wool fibers exhibited both changes in surface morphology and fragmentation into smaller particles. A range of molecular degradation products were identified in seawater leachates after UV exposure, with increasing abundance over the duration of the experiment. Furthermore, a variety of additive chemicals were shown to leach from the MFs into seawater. While some of these chemicals were also susceptible to UV degradation and some are expected to biodegrade rapidly, others may be persistent and contribute to the overall load of chemical pollution in the marine environment. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",0
P3J6H83U,Durability of GFRP reinforcing bars in seawater concrete,"This paper presents an experimental study that investigated the durability performance of unstressed glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars embedded in concrete mixed with seawater (seawater concrete). GFRP bars were extracted from concrete elements made with two different seawater concrete mix designs and exposed to different environmental conditions for 1, 6, 12, and 24 months. The concrete samples????? exposure environments consisted of typical field conditions of a subtropical region and seawater at 60 ??C as an accelerated aging method. The mechanical test results of GFRP bars are reported in residual capacities of tensile strength, longitudinal elastic modulus, transverse shear strength, and apparent horizontal shear strength. Furthermore, the physical evaluations are in terms of glass transition temperature (Tg) and microstructural integrity through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. Among all tested properties, tensile strength was the most affected by environmental conditioning. Based on an exponential degradation model, the long-term prediction of the tensile strength capacity was on average 92% under typical field exposure and 72% under the more aggressive conditioning (seawater at 60 ??C). ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
XNGEAHMV,Global patterns for the spatial distribution of floating microfibers: Arctic Ocean as a potential accumulation zone,"Despite their representativeness, most studies to date have underestimated the amount of microfibers (MFs) in the marine environment. Therefore, further research is still necessary to identify key processes governing MF distribution. Here, the interaction among surface water temperature, salinity, currents and winds explained the patterns of MF accumulation. The estimated density of floating MFs is ???5900 ?? 6800 items m???3 in the global ocean; and three patterns of accumulation were predicted by the proposed model: (i) intermediate densities in ocean gyres, Seas of Japan and of Okhotsk, Mediterranean and around the Antarctic Ocean; (ii) high densities in the Arctic Ocean; and (iii) point zones of highest densities inside the Arctic Seas. Coastal areas and upwelling systems have low accumulation potential. At the same time, zones of divergences between westerlies and trade winds, located above the tropical oceanic gyres, are predicted to accumulate MFs. In addition, it is likely that the warm branch of the thermohaline circulation has an important role in the transport of MFs towards the Arctic Ocean, emphasizing that surface water masses are important predictors. This study highlights that the Arctic Ocean is a dead end for floating MFs. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
Q5B8MLUG,Interactions between microplastics and oil dispersion in the marine environment,"Microplastics (MPs) and spilled oil are both major concerns in the marine environment. In this study, we investigated if and how MPs would interact with crude oil and potentially reduce the effectiveness of oil dispersants applied during oil spill response operations. With the addition of dispersant, MPs and oil (covered by dispersants through their hydrophobic tails) formed MPs-oil-dispersant agglomerates that were found to exist from the surface layer to the bottom of the seawater column. Their resurfacing and sinking led to a decrease in oil dispersion effectiveness. Effects of MP concentration, MP aging, and dispersant-to-oil volumetric ratios (DORs) on oil dispersion were examined. We found that the dispersion effectiveness of light oil and heavy oil decreased 38.26 % and 38.25 %, respectively, with an increased MP concentration. The dispersion effectiveness of light oil and heavy oil was 82.86 ?? 10.87 % and 40.39 ?? 4.96 % with pristine MPs and increased up to 109.75 ?? 0.71 % and 58.30 ?? 0.00 % when using MPs aged for 56 days. MPs reduced oil dispersion effectiveness under different DORs. The findings of this first report to understand the interactions among MPs, oil and dispersants have provided fundamental insights that may influence future decision making on the selection and use of oil spill response strategies. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
RXUNABCF,"Uptake, tissue distribution and toxicological effects of environmental microplastics in early juvenile fish Dicentrarchus labrax","As the smallest environmental microplastics (EMPs), even at nanoscale, are increasingly present in the environment, their availability and physical and chemical effects on marine organisms are poorly documented. In the present study, we primarily investigated the uptake and accumulation of a mixture of environmental microplastics (EMPs) obtained during an artificial degradation process in early-juvenile sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Moreover, we evaluated their hazardous effects using biochemical markers of cytotoxicity. Polymer distribution and composition in gill, gut, and liver were analyzed using polarized light microscopy (PLM) and Raman microspectroscopy (RMS). Our findings revealed the size-dependent ingestion and accumulation of smaller MPs (0.45?????3 ??m) in fish tissues even after a short-term exposure (3 and 5 days). In addition to MPs, our results showed the presence of plastic additives including plasticizers, flame retardants, curing agents, heat stabilizers, and fiber-reinforced plastic materials in fish tissues, which contributed mostly to the larger-sized range (??? 1.2 ??m). Our data showed that significant oxidative alterations were highly correlated with MPs size range. Our results emphasized that the toxicity of smaller EMPs (??? 3 ??m) was closely related to different factors, including the target tissue, exposure duration, size range of MPs, and their chemical properties. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
3KU5DMXV,"Assessment of origin and abundance of beach litter in Homa Lagoon coast, West Mediterranean Sea of Turkey","The pollution of beach litter was seasonally evaluated in a selected beach in the West Mediterranean Region of Turkey between December 2019 and September 2020. Beach litter survey was carried out seasonally according to ?????Guidance on Monitoring of Marine Litter in European Seas????? published by European Marine Strategy Framework Directive Technical Subgroup on Marine Litter. During the study, a total of 2.324 items and 105.44 kg were collected. The average litter density was 581.0 ?? 60.04 items/m2 and 26.36 ?? 0.85 g/m2. The results indicated that the most common type of litter were plastic/polystyrene (35%), unidentifiable (18%) followed by cloth/textile (16%). Litter density showed significant seasonal differences with the highest in summer (P &lt; 0.05). Homa beach was classified as ?????dirty????? according to Clean Coast Index. It was observed that the litter in the region averagely consisted of mixed packaging litter (24.25%), fisheries related litter (19%) and unclassified litter (15.25%) items. Our results show that the coast of Homa Lagoon exposed to a significant amount of marine litter pollution originated from land-based sources. This study provides further evidence that there is a significant litter pollution in the West Mediterranean Sea of Turkey and that the main component are plastics, which pose a great treat to the Mediterranean Sea environments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
SRVDL4E5,From nanoplastic to microplastic: A bibliometric analysis on the presence of plastic particles in the environment,"Identifying leading publications, authors, and countries in microplastic and nanoplastic research is beneficial for regulatory decisions, determining standardized research methodology, and solidifying definitions. Here, bibliometric analysis was performed using Web of Science's Core Collection to evaluate publication trends. A total of 3820 publications were downloaded and analyzed with the majority being journal articles. Since 2009, the number of publications has substantially increased. Results revealed that although the USA and China are the topmost publishing countries, two out of three of the top publishing institutions lie outside of these countries. The year with highest total number of citations was 2019 (42,000 citations), followed by 2018 (25,000 citations) and 2017 (13,000 citations). The journal Marine Pollution Bulletin published the highest number of records and included the top cited publications. Top publishing countries and the top cited publications and authors will likely pave the way for standardization in both microplastic and nanoplastic research. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
WQ88HUWS,"Microplastics accumulation in sediments and Periophthalmus waltoni fish, mangrove forests in southern Iran","This investigation was aimed to identify microplastics in the sediment and mudskipper fish (Periophthalmus waltoni) in mangrove forests in southern Iran. Sediments and mudskipper samples were collected at high, mid, and low tidal points of five stations. A total of 2657 plastic particles in different size, color, shape, and genera were identified from sediment samples and 15 microplastic were isolated from mudskippers. The highest and lowest abundance of isolated microplastics from sediments was observed in mangrove forests of Bidkhoun (urban area) and Bordkhon, respectively while no microplastics were found in the fish tissue in those stations. The black (60%) and white (7%) color microplastics in the mudskipper had the highest and the lowest frequency. The highest and lowest polymers in mangrove forest sediments were corresponded to polystyrene (26%) and polycarbonate (3%), respectively. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques were used to identify the type of the polymer. Most of the microplastics found were made of polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate. The type of studied area and texture of sediment separately affected the frequency of microplastic and mesoplastic (P-value <0.05) in the sediment samples. The abundance of microplastics in the sediment samples of the Bidkhoun mangrove forest was higher than other studied stations due to proximity to urban and industrial areas. The findings of this study raised concerns about microplastic pollution in the mangrove forests of southern Iran, a threat to the ecosystem and public health, which requires careful actions to prevent and diminish its adverse effects. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
Q4BHK272,Microplastics in the edible tissues of shellfishes sold for human consumption,"Microplastics in seafood are an emerging area of seafood safety concern. In this study, we investigated the presence of microplastics (100 ??m ????? 5 mm) in the edible tissues of four species of shellfishes - two species of shrimp, Metapenaeus dobsoni and Fenneropenaeus indicus; one species of crab, Portunus pelagicus; and one species of squid Uroteuthis (Photololigo) duvaucelii -all bought from fishing harbours of Kerala, India. An average of 2.7 ?? 12 microplastic particles kg???1 of edible tissue (wet weight) and 0.07 ?? 0.3 microplastic particles/individual were obtained from the sampled shellfishes. No microplastics were found in the edible tissues of shrimps examined, while U.

There was significant species variation in the microplastic contamination of shellfish soft tissues (p &lt; 0.05). The study is the first of its kind to report the detection of microplastics in edible tissues of a squid species. Results suggested an annual dietary intake of about 13 ?? 58 microplastic particles per year by shellfish consumers, which can vary based on the species, quantity, and extent of gut removal of seafood consumed. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
35U9KLXG,"Ecological risk assessment of microplastics in coastal, shelf, and deep sea waters with a consideration of environmentally relevant size and shape","Ecological risk assessment was conducted by matching size range and morphology of microplastics in both toxicity data and field monitoring data. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd This study assessed the ecological risk posed by microplastics in surface and subsurface seawaters in coastal, continental shelf, and deep-sea areas of South Korea. The target microplastics for risk assessment were specified as only non-spherical type microplastics in the size range 20?????300 ??m, because this type was predominantly observed in our study areas, and adverse biological effects have previously been reported. Exposure data for non-spherical microplastics were obtained from a previous study or were measured for microplastics of sizes down to 20 ??m. A predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of 12 particles/L was derived by employing a species sensitivity distribution approach. Then the results were compared to the in situ observed concentrations at each site. The detected microplastic concentrations did not exceed the derived PNEC, i.e., the current pollution levels of fragment and fiber microplastics in the size range 20?????300 ??m would not pose a significant threat to the marine ecosystem in South Korea. However, predictions are that microplastic pollution will increase to 50-fold by 2100 at the current rates, and in this scenario, the microplastic concentration is expected to far exceed the derived PNEC values for marine ecosystems. It is therefore urgent to take precautionary actions to prevent a further increase in microplastic concentrations in these environments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
CK6QZP92,Microplastic accumulation via trophic transfer: Can a predatory crab counter the adverse effects of microplastics by body defence?,"Microplastics are considered detrimental to aquatic organisms due to their potential accumulation along food chains. Thus, it is puzzling why some of them appear unaffected by microplastics. Here, we assessed the contribution of water filtration and food consumption to microplastic accumulation in a predatory marine crab (Charybdis japonica) and examined the associated impacts of microplastics (particle size: 5 ??m) following ingestion for one week. Results showed that water filtration and food consumption contributed similarly to the accumulation of microplastics, which were distributed among organs in this order: hepatopancreas &gt; guts &gt; gills &gt; muscles. Yet, biomagnification (i.e. accumulation through consumption of microplastic-contaminated mussels) did not occur possibly due to egestion of microplastics. The crabs upregulated detoxification capacity (EROD) and antioxidant defence (GST) in response to the microplastics accumulated in their tissues. However, these defence mechanisms collapsed when the microplastic concentration in hepatopancreas exceeded 3 mg g???1, leading to severe hepatic injury (elevated AST and ALT) and impaired neural activity (reduced AChE). Our results suggest that marine organisms have an innate capacity to counter the acute effects of microplastics, but there is a limit beyond which the defence mechanisms fail and hence physiological functions are impaired. As microplastic pollution will deteriorate in the future, the fitness and survival of marine organisms may be undermined by microplastics, affecting the stability and functioning of marine ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
VXP4IGIA,"First insights into plastic and microplastic occurrence in biotic and abiotic compartments, and snow from a high-mountain lake (Carnic Alps)","Plastic pollution has become a pervasive environmental problem on a global scale, from the ocean depths to the aquatic ecosystems of the Tibetan Plateau. To date, data on plastic and microplastic occurrence in pristine ecosystems like high-mountain lakes are lacking. In this study, plastic (&gt;5000 ??m) and microplastic (10?????5000 ??m) levels were measured in snow at the end of the winter season (April 2020), and in water, sediment, and biological samples collected monthly (June?????October 2019) during the ice-free season from the Dimon Lake, a high-mountain lake in the Carnic Alps, northeast Italy. Biological samples consisted of chironomids (Diptera, Chironomidae; n = 150) and stomach contents of Cottus gobio (n = 40). Analysis of the water, sediment, and biological samples revealed the absence of plastic and microplastics larger than 10 ??m, whereas the snow samples contained microplastics of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) albeit at very low levels (0.11 ?? 0.19 L-1). These results show that while the lake ecosystem could be considered unpolluted by microplastics, abundant snow precipitation in winter can trap microplastic particles that deposit on the ground. The very low levels of PET microparticles recorded in the snow samples suggest the need for further research to better understand the source of microplastic pollution in this environmental matrix. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
2WCIVHME,Nationwide monitoring of microplastics in bivalves from the coastal environment of Korea,"Bivalves are useful bioindicators of microplastic contamination in the marine environment for several reasons, such as extensive filter feeding activity, broad geographical distribution, and limited movement capability. This study conducted a nationwide monitoring of microplastic pollution along the Korean coasts using filter-feeding bivalves (including oyster, mussel, and Manila clam) as bioindicators to identify the national contamination level and characteristics of microplastics. Seawater sample was collected from the same sampling stations of oyster and mussel for comparison. Microplastics were widely distributed in both coastal bivalves and waters with mean concentrations of 0.33 ?? 0.23 n/g (1.21 ?? 0.68 n/individual) in oyster/mussel, 0.43 ?? 0.32 n/g (2.19 ?? 1.20 n/individual) in Manila clam, and 1400 ?? 560 n/m3 in seawater. Despite the lack of significant relationship in the abundance of microplastics, their dominant features such as size, shape, color and polymer type were similar between bivalves and seawater. Fragments (69% for oyster/mussel, 72% for Manila clam, and 77% for seawater), particles smaller than 300 ??m (96% for oyster/mussel, 83% for Manila clam, and 84% for seawater) and colorless (79% for oyster/mussel, 85% for Manila clam, 75% for seawater) were the dominant shape, size and color, respectively. The major polymer types were polypropylene, polyethylene, and polyester. The microplastic level in bivalves was relatively high in urbanized areas with a wide diversity of polymer types compared with those in non-urbanized areas, and the proportion of polystyrene in the Korean samples was abundant compared with other regions due to wide use of polystyrene products in Korea. Our result suggests that microplastic contamination is widespread in the Korean coastal environment, and bivalves can reflect the microplastic pollution characteristics of the surrounding waters where they live. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd A nationwide biomonitoring study was conducted to identify the national contamination level and characteristics of microplastics in Korea. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
ID2L2KF9,Assessment of beach litter pollution in Adana Akyatan Lagoon Coast of the East Mediterranean,"This study is the first study to determine beach litter pollution in the Eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey. The pollution of beach litter were seasonally evaluated in a selected beach in the East Mediterranean Sea between August 2019 and April 2020. Beach litter survey was carried out seasonally according to ?????Guidance on Monitoring of Marine Litter in European Seas????? published by European Marine Strategy Framework Directive Technical Subgroup on Marine Litter. During the study, a total of 10.717 items and 229.29 kg were collected. The average litter abundance was 2.679 ?? 0.418 items/m2 and 57.326 ?? 7.165 g/m2. The results indicated that the most common type of litter were plastic and cloth/textile (84%) followed by paper/cardboard (56%), the unidentifiable (51%). Litter density showed significant seasonal differences with the highest in summer (P &lt; 0.05). Akyatan beach was classified as extremely dirty according to Clean Coast Index. It was observed that the litter in the region averagely consisted mostly of mixed packaging litter (23.75%), domestic litter (20%) and unclassified litter (16.2%) items. Our results show that the coast of Akyatan Lagoon exposed to a significant amount of marine litter pollution originated from land-based sources. This study provides further evidence that there is a significant litter pollution in the East Mediterranean Sea and that the main component are plastics, which pose a great treat to Mediterranean Sea environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
SVK82GGK,Microfiber abundance associated with coral tissue varies geographically on the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System,"Ocean plastic pollution is a global problem that causes ecosystem degradation. Crucial knowledge gaps exist concerning patterns in microfiber abundance across regions and ecosystems, as well as the role of these pollutants within the environment. Here, we quantified the abundance of microfibers in coral samples collected from the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) using a polarized light microscope and identified a subsample of these to the polymer level using an Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy microscope. Microfibers were found in all coral samples with rayon being identified as the most common microfiber, comprising 85% of quantified pollutants. We found a greater average abundance of microfibers in coral samples from the Sapodilla Cayes (296 ?? SE 89) than in samples from the Drowned Cayes (75 ?? SE 14), indicating spatial variation in microfiber abundance within coral tissue along the MBRS. These results demonstrate that corals on the Belize MBRS interact with microfibers and that microfiber abundance on reefs varies spatially due to point sources of pollution and local oceanography. As rayon from clothing typically enters the ocean through wastewater effluent, alterations to waste water infrastructure may prove useful in decreasing rayon pollution in coastal waters. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
Y5YRVIPD,Characteristics and spatial distribution of microplastics in the lower Ganga River water and sediment,"Although India is one of the major plastic-waste-generating countries, few studies have been conducted on microplastics (MPs) in freshwater systems that are key contributors to oceans. The current study explores MPs in sediments and water that were collected at five major cities across the Ganga River. MPs number and mass density range in sediment were found to be 17 to 36 items/kg dry weight (d.w.) and 10 to 45 mg/kg d.w. of sediments, respectively, while in the water sample, they were 380 to 684 items/1000 m3 and 143 to 340 mg/1000 m3, respectively. Overall, white color and film-shaped MPs were the major contributors in all samples. MPs of 2.5?????5 mm size contributed to a greater number and mass as compared to other fractions. Polyethylene was found to be a widely distributed plastic-type reflecting its high usability. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
4GCV6K34,Effect of chronic exposure to microplastic fibre ingestion in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus,"Microplastics (MPs) in the form of microfibres (MFs) are of great concern because of their size and increasing abundance, which increase their potential to interact with or be ingested by aquatic organisms. Although MFs are the dominant shape of MPs ingested by sea cucumbers in habitats, their effect on sea cucumbers remains unclear. This study examined the effect of dietary exposure to MFs on the growth and physiological status of both juvenile and adult Apostichopus japonicus sea cucumbers. MFs were mixed into the diet of sea cucumbers for 60 d at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.6 MFs g???1, 1.2 MFs g???1 and 10 MFs g???1. Dietary exposure to MFs, with concentrations at or above those commonly found in the habitats, did not significantly affect the growth and faecal production rate of either juvenile or adult sea cucumbers. However, a disruption in immunity indices (acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activity) and oxidative stress indices (total antioxidant capacity and malondialdehyde content) was observed in juvenile and adult sea cucumbers, indicating that these indices might be useful as potential biomarkers of the exposure to MF ingestion in sea cucumbers. This study provides insights into the toxicity mechanism of MF ingestion in a commercially and ecologically important species. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
72JL4CQR,Lensless digital holographic microscopy as an efficient method to monitor enzymatic plastic degradation,"A big challenge of the 21st century is to cope with the huge amounts of plastic waste on Earth. Especially the oceans are heavily polluted with plastics. To counteract this issue, biological (enzymatic) plastic decomposition is increasingly gaining attention. Recently it was shown that polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be degraded in a saltwater-based environment using bacterial PETase produced by a marine diatom. At moderate temperatures, plastic biodegradation is slow and requires sensitive methods for detection, at least at initial stages. However, conventional methods for verifying the plastic degradation are either complex, expensive, time-consuming or they interfere with the degradation process. Here, we adapt lensless digital holographic microscopy (LDHM) as a new application for efficiently monitoring enzymatic degradation of a PET glycol copolymer (PETG). LDHM is a cost-effective, compact and sensitive optical method. We demonstrate enzymatic PETG degradation over a time course of 43 days employing numerical analysis of LDHM images. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
K5R5X7JL,What we need to know about PPE associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the marine environment,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak was declared as a global health emergency, the use of multiple types of plastic-based PPEs as a measure to reduce the infection increased tremendously. Recent evidence suggests that the overuse of PPEs during the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening plastic pollution in the marine environment. In this short focus, we discussed the potential sources, fate, and effects of PPE plastic to the marine environment and proposed five key research needs, involving (1) the occurrence and abundance of PPEs, (2) the sources, fate, and drivers of PPEs, (3) PPEs as a source of microplastics, (4) PPEs as a vector of invasive species and pathogens, and (5) PPEs as a source and vector of chemical pollutants in the marine environment. We suggest that addressing these knowledge gaps will lay the groundwork for improved COVID-19-associated waste management and legislation to prevent marine plastic pollution to continue exacerbating. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
8YQIX5HL,"Abundance and characteristics of microplastics in sediments from the world's longest natural beach, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh","This study aimed to provide the first description of the presence, quantity, and diversity of microplastics (MPs) in intertidal sediments from the world's longest natural beach, Cox's Bazar. MPs were extracted from 24 surficial sediment samples through the density separation method, and identification was carried out using a stereomicroscope. Results showed that the abundance of MPs varied from 200 to 378.8 items kg???1 with the mean abundance of 368.68 ?? 10.65 items kg???1. Fibers were the dominant (53%) MPs in this study, followed by films (20%) and fragments (12%). The dominant plastic particle color was purple (18%), followed by pink (14%) and red (7%), with shapes that were mainly filamentous (53%) and irregular (41%).

QUEQMUYP,Assessing microplastic as a vector for chemical entry into fish larvae using a novel tube-feeding approach,"A tube-feeding model for administering microplastic (MP, ?? = 30 ??m) spheres to fish larvae was employed to quantify the uptake of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) into the larval body through a single administration of MP. Polychlorinated biphenyl-153 (PCB-153) was used as a representative HOC that can be sorbed to MP in the sea. Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) larvae (34?????51 days post-hatching) were selected as the animal model. The herring larvae were tube-fed a single load of up to 200 polystyrene or polyethylene MP spheres spiked with 14C-labelled PCB-153, and the control larvae were tube-fed an isotonic solution without MP. At the time of sampling (24 h post feeding), some larvae had evacuated all MP spheres from the gut, while others still had MP remaining in the gut. In larvae with a significant number of MP spheres still present in the gut, whole-body scintillation counting (including the MP in the gut lumen) showed elevated levels of the tracer compared to those in the control fish larvae. For larvae in which all or almost all MP had been evacuated by the time of sampling, the tracer levels of the whole body were not significantly different compared to those for the control fish larvae. These data indicate that there was no significant transfer of PCB-153 from contaminated MP into fish larvae within a gut-transit time of &lt;24 h. This study suggests that the vector role of MP in HOC uptake and absorption may be minor compared to that of other HOC uptake pathways. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",0
WSZEMDRR,"Microplastics and suspended particles in a strongly impacted coastal environment: Composition, abundance, surface texture, and interaction with metal ions","The composition and the interaction of the suspended particulate matter (SPM) with metal ions, along with the presence and characteristics of microplastics, were analyzed for the first time in the water column of the inner zone of Bah??a Blanca Estuary during winter (June, July, and August) 2019. Surface analysis techniques (Scanning Electron Microscopy combined with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, and X-ray Diffraction) were employed to obtain an in-depth characterization of the particulate matter, suggesting the presence of Fe in our samples, with a mixture of Fe3+/Fe2+ oxidation states. Microplastics ranged in concentrations between 3 and 11.5 items L???1, with an average of 6.50 items L???1 (S.E: ??4.01), being fibers the most abundant type. Infrared Spectroscopy suggests that these fibers correspond to semi-synthetic cellulose-based and poly(amide) remains. We concluded that the SPM is a significant vehicle for metals which might have adverse effects on marine organisms. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
N7SUYQXX,Preferences for coastal and marine conservation in Vietnam: Accounting for differences in individual choice set formation,"This paper has two objectives. The first is to estimate the value of implementing new coastal and marine conservation measures in Vietnam, focussing on the relative benefits of water quality improvements, coral conservation and control of marine plastic pollution. The second is to explicitly model any tendency of respondents to fail to give consideration to the ?????opt-out????? or status quo option in a choice experiment, due to social and cultural factors. The analysis employs the independent availability logit model with random coefficients to simultaneously account for heterogeneity of preferences and choice set formation. Results show significantly improved model fit when consideration set heterogeneity is taken into account. However, estimates of preference weights and marginal willingness to pay for marine conservation measures are unaffected by this modelling choice. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
8LWLBM2T,The use of an in vitro approach to assess marine invertebrate carboxylesterase responses to chemicals of environmental concern,"Carboxylesterases (CEs) are key enzymes which catalyse the hydrolysis reactions of multiple xenobiotics and endogenous ester moieties. Given their growing interest in the context of marine pollution and biomonitoring, this study focused on the in vitro sensitivity of marine invertebrate CEs to some pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products and plastic additives to assess their potential interaction on this enzymatic system and its suitability as biomarkers. Three bivalves, one gastropod and two crustaceans were used and CEs were quantified following current protocols set for mammalian models. Four substrates were screened for CEs determination and to test their adequacy in the hepatic fraction measures of the selected invertebrates. Two commercial recombinant human isoforms (hCE1 and hCE2) were also included for methodological validation. Among the invertebrates, mussels were revealed as the most sensitive to xenobiotic exposures while gastropods were the least as well as with particular substrate-specific preferences. Among chemicals of environmental concern, the plastic additive tetrabromobisphenol A displayed the highest CE-inhibitory capacity in all species. Since plastic additives easily breakdown from the polymer and may accumulate and metabolise in marine biota, their interaction with the CE key metabolic/detoxification processes may have consequences in invertebrate's physiology, affect bioaccumulation and therefore trophic web transfer and, ultimately, human health as shellfish consumers. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
UIWX5DFL,Acute exposure of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) induces immune signal regulation and ferroptosis in oryzias melastigma,"The plasticizer di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is becoming increasingly abundant throughout the global environment as plastic pollution becomes highly severe, especially in the ocean. The adverse effects of DEHP have garnered increasing concern as they are recognized as endocrine disruptors. However, information on the effects of DEHP in marine organisms remains limited. In this study, acute toxic effects on marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) following DEHP exposure were investigated. Transcriptome analysis was performed on the livers of medaka exposed to DEHP for 6 and 24 h. Results showed that 1595 genes were affected in all the analyzed specimens, and several genes expressed variably according to sex. Some pathways associated with immunity, metabolism, and endocrine system were significantly enriched, with the complement system appearing to be the most affected immune pathway. Pathway enrichment indicated that, under acute DEHP exposure, the immune response of females tended to be more sensitive than that of males. In addition, ferroptosis occurred in response to DEHP exposure, which resulted in an enrichment of the ferroptosis pathway along with iron overload, an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) content, and a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels. These results indicate that a form of cell death characterized by iron-dependence occurred following DEHP exposure, but the underlying mechanism requires further analysis. This study implies that DEHP can alter some molecular regulation patterns within a short period and induce cell death through ferroptosis. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
L3IYBG7M,Walking the talk: The responsibility of the scientific community for mitigating conference-generated waste,"An estimated 19?????23 million metric tons of global plastic waste reportedly entered aquatic environments in 2016 with mounting evidence that plastic marine debris causes ecological effects across all levels of biological organization in aquatic systems. Scientific conferences generate opportunities for waste through food and beverage services, giveaways, marketing and registration materials, poster and trade exhibits, attendee travel, lodging services, and local transportation. Zero waste measures instituted at the Sixth International Marine Debris Conference resulted in the avoidance of 76,300 single-use items. Zero waste is a process defined by a spectrum of actions ranging from no reduction whatsoever to generation of absolutely no waste. Achieving 100% zero waste is very difficult. Deciding where on the spectrum you wish to land and being comfortable with that target is paramount for event planning. Planning for reduced waste takes time, funding, and determination, but environmentally-themed organizations have a responsibility to lead by example. ?? 2021",0
MMJZSL8E,Experimental evidence of physiological and behavioral effects of microplastic ingestion in Sparus aurata,"Increasing global research has identified microplastics (MPs) to be impacting marine organisms. The present work aimed at investigating the physiological and behavioral effects of thirty-six juvenile Sparus aurata exposed to control, virgin and weathered MPs enriched diets during a 21-day period under controlled conditions. Physiological effects were assessed in liver and brain using the following biomarkers: activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GRd), the detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) and malondialdehyde (MDA) as indicative of lipid peroxidation. Individuals were recorded for behavior analysis (i.e. social interactions and feeding behavior). Results revealed an increase in cellular stress from control to weathered fish groups, with the virgin group showing intermediate levels in all quantified biomarkers. Significant differences were found in the liver for all biomarkers except for MDA, suggesting that exposure time to MPs in this experiment is long enough to trigger the activation of antioxidant enzymes but not to produce cell damage by lipid peroxidation. In brain tissue samples, fish from the weathered group presented significantly higher values for CAT and SOD, highlighting its function as primary antioxidants. Regarding behavioral effects, results showed that the two MPs enriched groups were significantly bolder during social interactions and, although no significantly, tended to be more active during feeding. In conclusion, MPs which have been weathered in marine environmental conditions produces a higher physiological response than virgin MPs but also, a physiological response is variable depending on the tissue analyzed. In addition, a short period to MP exposure seems to affect overall social and feeding behavior but, further research is needed to assess long-term effects of MP ingestion and its potential consequences on fish populations. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",0
WISH9PDG,The effects of cyclic loading on the reconsolidation behaviours of marine sedimentary clays under intermittent drainage conditions,"The reconsolidation settlement of marine sedimentary clay subgrade subjected to cyclic dynamic loading under intermittent drainage conditions needs to be further studied. In this study, a series of triaxial tests was conducted on natural Wenzhou soft clays to investigate the reconsolidation responses induced by staged cyclic loading under intermittent drainage conditions. The dynamic behaviours of the test specimens, such as the evolution of excess pore water pressure, variations in stress-strain hysteresis loops and resilient modulus, and cumulative strain development, are analysed and discussed. The experimental results show that during the intermittent quiescent drainage period, the dissipation of the excess pore pressure generated during the cyclic loading period results in reconsolidation of the test specimen. Hardening occurs throughout the tests, as determined by observing the variations in the hysteresis loops and resilient modulus. Throughout the tests, a higher percentage of the axial plastic strain in the quiescent period to the total axial plastic strain indicates that the reconsolidation deformation of the soft clay subgrade caused by intermittent drainage cannot be ignored. These conclusions have significant value for performing in-depth research on the dynamic behaviours of marine sedimentary clays subjected to cyclic traffic loading and predicting the settlement of roads in engineering practice. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
DGRS6ZP2,Marine litter on a highly urbanized beach at Southeast Brazil: A contribution to the development of litter monitoring programs,"Seasonal distribution of Marine Litter (ML) on Santos beaches was assessed using a citizen science strategy. Plastics and cigarette butts (CB) were the dominant items in all sampling campaigns. Seasonal distribution did not result in significant differences for most items. Plastic and CB amounts were high in summer compared to autumn. For all sampled sites the presence of beach users influenced ML densities. However, results showed that some sites presented an additional influence of local hydrodynamic. Moderate amounts of hazardous items including metal, glass, CB, sanitary waste and plastic tubes used to pack and market illicit drugs represented between 20.8 and 31% of all ML over the seasons. The beaches of Santos were classified as dirty in autumn and spring and as extremely dirty in winter and summer. These findings can serve as a baseline to support mitigating actions by public authorities and start monitoring programs of ML not only in Santos but also in other urbanized beaches. ?? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",1

EWYS3TXQ,Time-dependent metabolic disorders induced by short-term exposure to polystyrene microplastics in the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis,"In the modern society, plastic has achieved a crucial status in a myriad of applications because of its favourable properties. Despite the societal benefits, plastic has become a growing global concern due to it is persistence and bioavailability as microplastics (MPs) to aquatic biota. In order to provide mechanistic insights into the early toxicity effects of MPs on aquatic invertebrates, a short-term (up to 72 h) exposure to 3 ??m red polystyrene MPs (50 particles/mL) was conducted on marine mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, selected as model organism for their ability to ingest MPs and their commercial relevance. The use of protonic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR)-based metabolomics, combined with chemometrics, enabled a comprehensive exploration at fixed exposure time-points (T24, T48, T72) of the impact of MPs accumulated in mussel digestive glands, chosen as the major site for pollutants storage and detoxification processes. In detail, 1H NMR metabolic fingerprints of MP-treated mussels were clearly separated from control and grouped for experimental time-points by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Numerous metabolites, including amino acids, osmolytes, metabolites involved in energy metabolism, and antioxidants, participating in various metabolic pathways significantly changed over time in MP-exposed mussel digestive glands related to control, reflecting also the fluctuations in MPs accumulation and pointing out the occurrence of disorders in amino acid metabolism, osmotic equilibrium, antioxidant defense system and energy metabolism. Overall, the present work provides the first insights into the early mechanisms of toxicity of polystyrene MPs in marine invertebrates. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
Y6F6I99Q,Converting beach wrack into a resource as a challenge for the Baltic Sea (an overview),"The paper distinguishes beach wrack, the marine generated organic part of beach cast, as a separate management object and discusses research questions related to its management and economically viable use. Based on experiences from the Baltic Sea and existing practices from countries with different management systems clear distinction between the management of natural and anthropogenic components of cast material is seen as an essential prerequisite for developing sustainable product chains that allow beach wrack to be used as a resource of commercial value. Presenting and discussing examples from Denmark (K??ge Municipality), Germany (K??hlungsborn, R??gen and Poel Island), Poland (Gulf of Gdansk), Russia (Curonian and Vistula spits) and Sweden (Kalmar municipality and ??land), social, ecological, and economic consequences of beach wrack removal are analysed to improve the attractiveness of beaches for recreational purposes. It also includes potential contribution to Baltic Sea water restoration processes through the removal of the organic part of beach cast, where indeed more studies about the chemical (nutrients, metals) composition of beach wrack are required for reliable calculation of a depuration rate. For local economies within the Baltic Sea region, the organic part of beach cast (beach wrack and terrestrial debris) has reasonable economic prospects as a renewable natural resource, e.g. for soil improvement products, in fertilisers and bio-coal production, for landfill covers (contributing to climate change mitigation), biogas generation, and even for coastal protection by providing humus-like material for accelerated dune vegetation succession. For all these recycling options the development of cost-efficient technologies for collecting beach cast on sandy as well as stony beaches and also for separating the organic part from sand and anthropogenic litter (mainly plastic), is urgently required. Amendments of legal regulations, that better reflect the dualism of beach cast are also required. In essence, dualism results from the fact that beach wrack is a part of nature (or a natural resource) when it remains on a beach. However, beach wrack immediately becomes legally categorised as waste once humans collect it irrespective of its litter content. Another legal aspect being dealt with originates from the migration of the beach wrack between water and beach, whilst it is an object of ??????leagl cleaning operations only at the beach it onto the beach, but not whilst in the water. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
BD9JRP6J,A comparative study on the adsorption behavior of pesticides by pristine and aged microplastics from agricultural polyethylene soil films,"Compared with pristine agricultural polyethylene (PE) soil films microplastics (MPs), aged agricultural polyethylene (APE) soil films MPs have a rougher surface, more cracks and have some oxygen-containing functional groups that makes them adsorb organic pollutants, such as pesticides more easily. This may be more harmful to human beings than marine MPs as the agricultural soil films are closer to our living environment. But few works focused on the adsorption of pesticides on pristine or aged agricultural polyethylene soil films MPs. In order to promote the risk assessment of co-exposure of pesticides and agricultural polyethylene soil films MPs, a comparative study on the adsorption behavior and mechanism of four pesticides (carbendazim, diflubenzuron, malathion, difenoconazole) by pristine PE MPs and APE MPs were carried out in this paper. The results showed microcracks and surface oxidation observed on APE MPs. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm models indicated that the adsorption capacity of APE MPs was higher than that of PE MPs, which attribute to the larger surface area of APE MPs. The adsorption capacities of pesticides on APE MPs were positively correlated with LogKow (Water octanol partition coefficient) values of these four pesticides, showed the hydrophobic partitioning played the most important part in the adsorption, but also some H-bonding between secondary amines in the molecular of diflubenzuron and polar O-containing functional groups on APE MPs may be formed. And electrostatic forces or interactions are not the determining factor for these pesticides adsorption behavior of PE MPs, and the effect of pH is mainly driven by changes in sorbate properties rather than changes in surface properties of MPs. The results presented herein show the APE MPs can be a better vector of most hydrophobic pesticides than pristine MPs in the agricultural field, and more attention should be paid to the problem of films and pesticides residue in farmland soil. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
4PH3A3IQ,"Ductile, durable, and reliable alternative to FRP bars for reinforcing seawater sea-sand recycled concrete beams: steel/FRP composite bars","The combination of seawater, sea-sand and recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) to make the so-called seawater sea-sand recycled concrete (SSRC) is a promising alternative to mitigate the shortage of raw construction materials, e.g. river sand, freshwater and crushed stone. Although equipped with anti-corrosion and high strength, the reduced ductility due to the linear elastic nature of conventional fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars hinders their application scope in civil engineering. Inherited the advantages of FRP bars, steel fiber-reinforced polymer composite bars (SFCBs) are also characterized by good ductility and stable post-yield stiffness, which can potentially be ideal reinforcement for concrete structures made with un-desalted corrosive raw materials. This paper presents experimental and theoretical investigations on the flexural performance of SFCB reinforced SSRC beams. Test results indicate that the displacement ductility factor of almost all the SFCB reinforced SSRC beams are in a range from 3.7 to 4.9. The ratios of peak load-to-yielding load of SFCB reinforced SSRC beams varied from 1.5 to 3.1, indicating a remarkable post-yield behavior. Compared with the counterparts with natural aggregates, SSRC beams show slightly reduced flexural strength and comparable ductility. Theoretical models were proposed to predict the load-deflection responses of SFCB reinforced SSRC beams, which paves the way for the design of such members. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
A9CEJLU4,Insights on the adhesive properties and debonding mechanism of CFRP/concrete interface under sulfate environment: From experiments to molecular dynamics,"Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP)-reinforced concrete structures serving in the marine environment are susceptible to sulfate attack, and the CFRP/concrete interface becomes the most vulnerable due to adhesive degradation. In this paper, the influences of the sulfate on the adhesion of the CFRP/concrete interface are investigated by combination of experiments and molecular dynamics simulation. Macro experiments show that the debonding between CFRP and concretes generally results from the adhesive failure at the epoxy/concrete interface. As the corrosion age increases, the maximum shear stress of the interface decreases gradually and tends to transfer to the non-loading side. Meanwhile, both of the fracture energy and adhesive strength of the CFRP/concrete interface is reduced due to the sulfate attack. Besides, molecular dynamics simulations reveal the micro-adhesive mechanism of the epoxy/calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) interface, and offer an atomic explanation for the sulfate environment weakening the adhesion of epoxy/C-S-H interface. Expectantly, this study can promote a comprehensive understanding of sustainable and durable CFRP-reinforced concrete. ?? 2020",0
T98AXNIP,The effects of magnesium concentration in low-salinity water on growth of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei),"The current study evaluates the effect of different Mg levels in low-salinity (3 g/L) water on growth, survival, haemolymph osmolality, cationic composition in haemolymph, carapace and whole body of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. A low-cost salt mixture (LCSM) comprised of Na, K, Ca and Mg concentrations of 298, 9, 17 and 39 mg/L, respectively, in a 1-g/L solution was modified by decreasing the Mg level of LCSM to allow different Mg levels in the culture medium (100, 78, 55, 30, 17, 13 and 12 mg/L). Reconstituted sea salt (RSS) was used as the control treatment with Mg level of 129 mg/L. A 42-day growth trial (initial weight: 0.11 ?? 0.01 g and stocking density: 20 shrimp/tank) was carried out in 150-L plastic tanks, each equipped with a fluidized bed biofilter. As Mg2+ level was reduced, there was a subsequent reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in shrimp performance reflected in final weight, weight gain, haemolymph osmolality, osmoregulatory capacity, Mg2+ concentration in haemolymph, carapace and whole body of shrimp paralleled by an increase in feed conversion ratio (FCR). Low haemolymph osmolality and Mg2+ concentrations (p &lt; 0.05) in shrimp haemolymph were found to be indicative of stress, which was ultimately reflected as reduced growth and increased FCR in low Mg2+ concentrations at 3 g/L salinity. ?? 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",0
B26HJEF5,A method to measure the integral vertical intensity and angular distribution of atmospheric muons with a stationary plastic scintillator bar detector,"We present a method to measure the integral vertical intensity and angular distribution of atmospheric muons using a stationary thick plastic scintillator bar detector with PMTs at both of its ends over exposures of a few hours in a laboratory setting. The total flux is obtained from the event rate and the angular distribution is inferred from the distribution of the recorded pulse charges, which are correlated with the track length inside the plastic scintillator. A muon generator algorithm was developed and used together with a simple simulation including the effects of the detector resolution, nonlinear saturation of the PMTs, and laboratory building coverage. As a proof of principle we made a measurement assuming a standard cosn?? omnienergetic angular distribution with azimuthal isotropy and different models for the energy spectrum of the source. Using measurements at 5 different azimuthal orientations, we measure an average exponent n=(1.90??0.06(stat)??0.10(syst)), and an average vertical intensity of I0=(101.2??1.8(stat)??5.5(syst))m???2s???1sr???1 at the location with geographic coordinates 19.33??N 99.19??W, altitude 2268 m above sea level, and geomagnetic cut-off of 8.2 GV. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
NZUQ65T3,Experimental study of mechanical and fresh properties of HVFA-SCC with and without PP fibers,"This paper aims to study the mechanical and fresh properties of novel high-volume fly ash-self compacting concretes (HVFA-SCCs). Firstly, the mechanical and flowability properties of SCCs with different fly ash replacement ratio are investigated. Thereafter, the high-volume polypropylene (PP) fibers were added into the HVFA-SCC, and the effects of some parameters on its performance are explored for proposing its mix proportion design scheme. Finally, the hardening and fresh properties of seawater and sea-sand HVFA-SCCs are discussed. The results show that HVFA-SCC, high-volume PP fibers reinforced HVFA-SCC, seawater and sea-sand HVFA-SCC are feasible used in various constructions. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
P4A98M8J,Systematic identification of microplastics in abyssal and hadal sediments of the Kuril Kamchatka trench,"The occurrence of microplastics throughout marine environments worldwide, from pelagic to benthic habitats, has become serious cause for concern. Hadal zones were recently described as the ?????trash bins of the oceans????? and ultimate sink for marine plastic debris. The Kuril region covers a substantial area of the North Pacific Ocean and is characterised by high biological productivity, intense marine traffic through the Kuril straits, and anthropogenic activity. Moreover, strong tidal currents and eddy activity, as well as the influence of Pacific currents, have the potential for long distance transport and retention of microplastics in this area. To verify the hypothesis that the underlying Kuril Kamchatka Trench might accumulate microplastics from the surrounding environments and act as the final sink for high quantities of microplastics, we analysed eight sediment samples collected in the Kuril Kamchatka Trench at a depth range of 5143?????8250 m during the Kuril Kamchatka Biodiversity Studies II (KuramBio II) expedition in summer 2016. Microplastics were characterised via Micro Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. All samples were analysed in their entirety to avoid inaccuracies due to extrapolations of microplastic concentrations and polymer diversities, which would otherwise be based on commonly applied representative aliquots. The number of microplastic particles detected ranged from 14 to 209 kg???1 sediment (dry weight) with a total of 15 different plastic polymers detected. Polypropylene accounted for the largest proportion (33.2%), followed by acrylates/polyurethane/varnish (19%) and oxidized polypropylene (17.4%). By comparing extrapolated sample aliquots with in toto results, it was shown that aliquot-based extrapolations lead to severe under- or overestimations of microplastic concentrations, and an underestimation of polymer diversity. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Microplastics were detected in the abyssal and hadal zones of the Kuril Kamchatka trench.By comparing extrapolated sample aliquots with in toto results, it was shown that aliquot-based extrapolations lead to severe under- or overestimations of microplastic concentrations and an underestimation of polymer diversity. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
N4TCX4HW,Developmental toxicity of plastic leachates on the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus,"Microplastic pollution has become ubiquitous, affecting a wide variety of biota. Although microplastics are known to alter the development of a range of marine invertebrates, no studies provide a detailed morphological characterisation of the developmental defects. Likewise, the developmental toxicity of chemicals leached from plastic particles is understudied. The consequences of these developmental effects are likely underestimated, and the effects on ecosystems are unknown. Using the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus as a model, we studied the effects of leachates of three forms of plastic pellet: new industrial pre-production plastic nurdles, beached pre-production nurdles, and floating filters, known as biobeads, also retrieved from the environment. Our chemical analyses show that leachates from beached pellets (biobead and nurdle pellets) and highly plasticised industrial pellets (PVC) contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls, which are known to be detrimental to development and other life stages of animals. We also demonstrate that these microplastic leachates elicit severe, consistent and treatment-specific developmental abnormalities in P. lividus at embryonic and larval stages. Those embryos exposed to virgin polyethylene leachates with no additives nor environmental contaminants developed normally, suggesting that the abnormalities observed are the result of exposure to either environmentally adsorbed contaminants or pre-existing industrial additives within the polymer matrix. In the light of the chemical contents of the leachates and other characteristics of the plastic particles used, we discuss the phenotypes observed during our study, which include abnormal gastrulation, impaired skeletogenesis, abnormal neurogenesis, redistribution of pigmented cells and embryo radialisation. ?? 2020 The Author(s) Capsule: We demonstrate that plastic particles retrieved from the marine environment or factory settings leach contaminants to the water that adversely affect early development of sea-urchins. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",0
APJB5CKC,"Microplastic content of Kutum fish, Rutilus frisii kutum in the southern Caspian Sea","The occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in the digestive tract of commercial Kutum fish, Rutilus frisii kutum was investigated. Fish samples, ranging from 33 to 48.5 cm fork length which sold for human consumption, were collected from local fish markets in Bandar-e Torkaman (the south-eastern of Caspian Sea) on November 2017, and March 2018. The MPs were characterized using optical microscopy, NR staining, and SEM-EDS for number, shape, color, surface morphology, and elemental composition. On average, 11.4 MP items per fish (0.015 items per 1 g fish wet weight) were found in Kutum's stomach at an individual detection rate of 80%. Around 66% of all identified MP items were < 500 ??m, and 53% possessed light colors. Morphological researches indicated that fish ingested the degradation fragments from larger plastic pieces, fibers, and manufactured microbeads. Microfibers are the most dominant items accounting for over 75% of all MPs. The SEM images indicated the various degrees of erosions upon environmental exposure. Some MPs had surface cracks, broken margins, scaly appearances, and obvious pores. Considering the commercial importance which the Kutum plays for Iran's fishery, the potential effect of MPs on the trophic food web, particularly for human consumption and health, should be urgently investigated. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
P9XBP9YP,Preferential transport of microplastics by wind,"Contamination of terrestrial and marine environments by plastic waste has been widely documented. Most research into the distribution of microplastics has focused on water but here we show that wind transport can be very effective in mobilising microplastic particles. A series of wind tunnel experiments using two different substrates (sand and soil), two different microplastics (microbeads and fibres) and 5 different concentrations of microplastics (ranging from 0 mg kg???1dw to 1040 mg kg???1dw) is used to demonstrate that microplastics are preferentially transported by wind compared to sand and soil. When compared to either of the untreated substrate beds (0 mg kg???1dw), the inclusion of microplastics was not found to significantly affect the wind erosion threshold for any of the concentrations or geometric forms (fibres or beads) tested. Averaged over all concentrations of microplastics and both substrate types, microplastic enrichment was lower for microbeads than fibres. The enrichment of microplastic fibres within the entrained particulate matter was one to two orders of magnitude higher for both test bed substrates, ranging from 98 to 498 for the sand and 278 to 726 for the soil. This suggests microplastic shape needs to be carefully parameterized in models of atmospheric microplastic transport. We suggest that microplastic research could benefit from previous investigations into the wind erosion of soil organic carbon. ?? 2020",0
I5NQ33MG,Microplastic retention by marine vegetated canopies: Simulations with seagrass meadows in a hydraulic flume,"Main finding: marine canopies with high shoot density might act as sinks for microplastics of high polymer density in areas of low flow velocity. ?? 2020 The Author(s) Marine canopies formed by seagrass and other coastal vegetated ecosystems could act as sinks of microplastics for being efficient particle traps. Here we investigated for the first time the occurrence of microplastic retention by marine canopies in a hydraulic flume under unidirectional flow velocities from 2 to 30 cm s???1. We used as model canopy-forming species the seagrass Zostera marina with four canopy shoot density (0, 50, 100, 200 shoots m???2), and we used as microplastic particles industrial pristine pellets with specific densities from 0.90 to 1.34 g cm???3 (polypropylene PP; polystyrene PS; polyamide 6 PA; and polyethylene terephthalate PET). Overall, microplastics particles transported with the flow were retained in the seagrass canopies but not in bare sand. While seagrass canopies retained floating microplastics (PP) only at low velocities (&lt;12 cm s???1) due to a barrier created by the canopy touching the water surface, the retention of sinking particles (PS, PA, PET) occurred across a wider range of flow velocities. Our simulations revealed that less dense sinking particles (PS) might escape from the canopy at high velocities, while denser sinking particles can be trapped in scouring areas created by erosive processes around the eelgrass shoots. Our results show that marine canopies might act as potential barriers or sinks for microplastics at certain bio-physical conditions, with the probability of retention generally increasing with the seagrass shoot density and polymer specific density and decreasing with the flow velocity. We conclude that seagrass meadows, and other aquatic canopy-forming ecosystems, should be prioritized habitats in assessment of microplastic exposure and impact on coastal areas since they may accumulate high concentration of microplastic particles that could affect associated fauna. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",0
56WINP6G,Species-specific impact of microplastics on coral physiology,"There is evidence that microplastic (MP) pollution can negatively influence coral health; however, mechanisms are unknown and most studies have used MP exposure concentrations that are considerably higher than current environmental conditions. Furthermore, whether MP exposure influences coral susceptibility to other stressors such as ocean warming is unknown. Our objective was to determine the physiology response of corals exposed to MP concentrations that have been observed in-situ at ambient and elevated temperature that replicates ocean warming. Here, two sets of short-term experiments were conducted at ambient and elevated temperature, exposing the corals Acropora sp. and Seriatopora hystrix to microspheres and microfibres. Throughout the experiments, gross photosynthesis and net respiration was quantified using a 4-chamber coral respirometer, and photosynthetic yields of photosystem II were measured using Pulse-Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry. Results indicate the effect of MP exposure is dependent on MP type, coral species, and temperature. MP fibres (but not spheres) reduced photosynthetic capability of Acropora sp., with a 41% decrease in photochemical efficiency at ambient temperature over 12 days. No additional stress response was observed at elevated temperature; photosynthetic performance significantly increased in Seriatopora hystrix exposed to MP spheres. These findings show that a disruption to coral photosynthetic ability can occur at MP concentrations that have been observed in the marine environment and that MP pollution impact on corals remains an important aspect for further research. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
27R7A6PA,Impact of weathering on the chemical identification of microplastics from usual packaging polymers in the marine environment,"Most of the plastics produced worldwide are finally disposed into the environment, most of them being one-use plastic packaging. Once released, plastics may undergone degradation through several agents, such as solar radiation, mechanical forces, and microbial action. Weathered plastics and microplastics (MPs) collected from the marine environment show considerable physical and chemical differences regarding their pristine counterparts; most notably on their surface, where spectrometric measurements are done. Hence, it is crucial to consider aging for their correct identification and quantification in environmental monitoring. Five of the most common polymers employed worldwide for packaging (LDPE, HDPE, PS, PP and PET) were weathered in a pilot-scale system simulating dry and marine conditions for more than 10 weeks. Aliquots were withdrawn periodically to monitor their weathering processes by means of infrared spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy; their spectra were compared and band ratios calculated. Results showed that an individual study of each polymer is necessary since degradation pathways and products depend on the polymer type. Moreover, including spectra of weathered polymers in the spectral libraries to obtain reliable identifications in microplastics pollution studies was critical. ?? 2020",0
LT4QZSXQ,"Toxic effects of exposure to microplastics with environmentally relevant shapes and concentrations: Accumulation, energy metabolism and tissue damage in oyster Crassostrea gigas","Microplastics (MPs) are widely found in coastal areas and oceans worldwide. The MPs are environmentally concerning due to their bioavailability and potential impacts on a wide range of marine biota, so assessing their impact on the biota has become an urgent research priority. In the present study, we exposed Crassostrea gigas oysters to irregular MPs of two polymer types (polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) at concentrations of 10 and 1000 ??g L???1 for 21 days. Accumulation of MPs, changes in metabolic enzyme activity, and histological damage were evaluated, and metabolomics analysis was conducted. Results demonstrated that PE and PET MPs were detected in the gills and digestive gland following exposure to both tested concentrations, confirming ingestion of MPs by the organisms. Moreover, both PE and PET MPs inhibited lipid metabolism, while energy metabolism enzyme activities were activated in the oysters. Histopathological damage of exposed oysters was also observed in this study. Integrated biomarker response (IBR) results showed that MPs toxicity increased with increasing MPs concentration, and the toxic effects of PET MPs on oysters was greater than PE MPs. In addition, metabolomics analysis suggested that MPs exposure induced alterations in metabolic profiles in oysters, with changes in energy metabolism and inflammatory responses. This study reports new insights into the consequences of MPs exposure in marine bivalves at environmentally relevant concentrations, providing valuable information for ecological risk assessment of MPs in a realistic conditions. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
H6IN33ZG,Chemotaxis-selective colonization of mangrove rhizosphere microbes on nine different microplastics,"Microplastics pollution poses a new threat to the environment of intertidal zone. The sea forest, mangrove, has been polluted by a large number of plastic debris worldwide. To fill the gaps in knowledge of mangrove rhizosphere microbes connected with the ?????plasticsphere?????, a semi-controlled in situ exposure experiment for nine different types of microplastics were conducted in mangrove ecosystem. A sign of biodegrading was observed on polyethylene, polyamide 6 and polyvinyl chloride microplastics surface after 3 months exposure. We discovered that the metabolic activities of the dominant bacteria on certain microplastics were related to the specific groups on polymers molecule. The selective colonization may be driven by the chemotaxis of bacteria. Specially, microplastics biofilms of polyethylene, polyamide 6, polyvinyl chloride and expanded polystyrene possess distinctive dominant bacteria assemblages which have great significance in ecosystem processes involving carbon cycle or sulfur cycle. Community of mangrove soil microorganism and microplastic biofilm varies as the seasons changes. As a new niche, microplastics has higher inclusivity to bacteria than surrounding soil. Additionally, pathogens for human beings (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Escherichia-Shigella) were detected both in microplastics and soil. We stress that the interaction between microplastics and rhizosphere microorganisms may affect the growth and health of mangrove plants. Besides, we point out that mangrove rhizosphere microorganism can be an ideal candidate for plastics-degradation. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
EU97N2SE,Analysis of microplastics of a broad size range in commercially important mussels by combining FTIR and Raman spectroscopy approaches,"Microplastic (MP) contamination is present in the entire marine environment from the sediment to the water surface and down to the deep sea. This ubiquitous presence of MP particles opens the possibility for their ingestion by nearly all species in the marine ecosystem. Reports have shown that MP particles are present in local commercial seafood species leading to the possible human ingestion of these particles. However, due to a lack of harmonized methods to identify microplastics (MPs), results from different studies and locations can hardly be compared. Hence, this study was aimed to detect, quantify, and estimate MP contamination in commercially important mussels originating from 12 different countries distributed worldwide. All mussels were obtained from supermarkets and were intended for human consumption. Using a combinatorial approach of focal plane array (FPA)-based micro- Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy allowed the detection and characterization of MP down to a size of 3 ??m in the investigated mussels. Further, a gentle sample purification method based on enzymes has been modified in order to optimize the digestion of organic material in mussels. A random forest classification (RFC) approach, which allows a rapid discrimination between different polymer types and thus fast generation of data on MP abundance and size distributions with high accuracy, was implemented in the analytical pipeline for IR spectra. Additionally, for the first time we also applied a RFC approach for the automated characterization of Raman spectra of MPs. Combinatorial approach of FTIR and Raman spectroscopy techniques coupled with enzymatic digestion and machine learning applied for the detection and analysis of MPs in commercial mussels obtained from supermarkets. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
FGI7H4M3,Projecting the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions onto microplastics in global aquatic environments using artificial neural networks,"Microplastics pollution and their interaction with heavy metal ions have gained global concern. It is essential to develop models to predict the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions onto microplastics in global aquatic environments, and to connect the laboratory study results with the field measurement results. In this paper, the artificial neural networks (ANN) models were established based on literature data. for The results showed that the ANN model could predict the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions (including Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, and Zn) onto microplastics in the global environments with high correlation coefficient (R) values (0.926???0.994). The predicted sorption capacity was influenced by the initial concentration of heavy metal ions and the salinity in surrounding water. The predicted sorption capacity in rivers and lakes was higher than that in the ocean. Aged microplastics had higher affinity to heavy metal ions than virgin microplastics. The predicted sorption capacity of Cd, Pb, and Zn ions onto large microplastics (5 mm) was less than 0.12 ??g/g. The predicted amount was in agreement with the field measurement results, suggesting that the laboratory studies can provide useful information for projecting the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions onto microplastics in global aquatic environments. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
QUN89VUW,Gut microbiota protects honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) against polystyrene microplastics exposure risks,"Microplastic contamination is not only a pressing environmental concern in oceans, but also terrestrial ecosystems. However, little is known about its potential impacts on pollinators. Here, we reported the effects of 25 ??m-diameter spherical polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) alone or in combination with the antibiotic tetracycline on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in the laboratory. We noticed that PS-MPs exposure for 14 d had sublethal effects, with low mortalities (up to 1.6 %) across three different treatments (0.5, 5, and 50 mg/L) and no changes to the body weight gains compared to the control bees. Nevertheless, PS-MPs exposure led to significant decreases in the ??-diversity of bees????? gut microbiota accompanied by changes to the core microbial population structure. Additionally, PS-MPs lead to alterations in the expression of antioxidative (Cat), detoxification (CypQ1 and GstS3), and immune system-related genes (Domeless, Hopscotch, and Symplekin) in guts. More interestingly, we observed that PS-MPs accumulated and degraded inside of the hindgut and interacted with gut bacteria. The depletion of the normal gut microbiota using tetracycline dramatically increased the lethality of microplastics. These results provide a resource for future research on microplastic-microbiome interactions in other insects and also shed light on understanding the potential effects of microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
HQ4U8IXL,Alleviation of tributyltin-induced toxicity by diet and microplastics in the marine rotifer Brachionus koreanus,"To determine the effects of tributyltin (TBT) upon multiple exposures of diet and microplastic in rotifer, in vivo life parameters were measured. In 10 ??g/L TBT-exposed rotifer, the 1 and 0.5 x diet groups resulted in reproduction reduction. However, 10 x diet treatment showed no significant changes in the total fecundity, despite a decrease in daily reproduction. Besides, differences in the lifespan were observed in response to different diet regimens. TBT and/or MP-exposed parental rotifer (F0) showed a significant delay in the pre-reproductive day under 0.5 x diet regimen. In all dietary regimens, exposure to TBT and MP induced an increase in reactive oxygen species, but antioxidant activities were perturbed. To further verify the carryover effect of TBT toxicity, progeny rotifer (F1) obtained from 24 h TBT and/or MP-exposed F0 was used. Interestingly, the faster hatching rate was observed only in F1 obtained from 1 x diet regimen-exposed F0. However, in the 0.5 x diet, the total fecundity was reduced and the pattern of the daily reproduction was collapsed. Thus, the toxicity of TBT can be alleviated by MP and nutrition status, but TBT-induced toxicity and its carryover effect are inevitable. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
EPRSP9SN,Fabrication of oil- and water-resistant paper without creating microplastics on disposal,"The proliferation of microplastics in the ocean and other water bodies is becoming an alarming issue. The development of plastic-free water- and oil-resistant paper can contribute toward mitigating this problem. Herein we report a plastic-free paper coating derived from chitosan and sunflower oil. Chitosan grafted sunflower oil paper coatings were prepared via the ring opening of the partially epoxidized sunflower oil with chitosan. The product of these reactions was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy techniques. The sunflower oil grafted chitosan solution was coated onto a Kraft paper.

2P93V7L8,Hazardous microplastic characteristics and its role as a vector of heavy metal in groundwater and surface water of coastal south India,"Study of hazardous microplastics in the natural water resources is minimal compared to the sea salt, seafood and even packaged water. We presented results of the first baseline research of microplastics in groundwater and surface water from the coastal south India (Tamil Nadu state) and evaluated the heavy metal adsorption capacities of different polymers. The microplastics (up to 19.9 particles/L) were of relatively larger size in surface water (0.34?????4.30 mm) compared to the groundwater (0.12?????2.50 mm). Polyamide (nylon), polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and cellulose were the common polymers and all of them showed different capacities of heavy metal adsorption. In two different experimental sites, the polypropylene showed higher capacity of adsorption compared to other polymers in the following orders: (i) cadmium > manganese > lead > arsenic and (ii) manganese > zinc > arsenic > lead > copper. The polyamide, however, exhibited better adsorption only for manganese. Similar to other recent findings, our results associate microplastics as a major vector to transport heavy metals in the water system. Formulation of strategies to reduce the environmental risks of particulate plastics as a potent vector for transportation of the toxic trace elements and subsequent, impact on human health through the OSPRC framework (Origins, Sources, Pathways, Receptors and Consequence) in the study area would require future research. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
33GLL276,Accumulation and ecotoxicological risk of weathered polyethylene (wPE) microplastics on green mussel (Perna viridis),"Recent studies have shown that organisms including humans are exposed to microplastics directly or indirectly. The present study aims to examine the ingestion of these microplastics and the consequences of the same by studying the accumulation behavior of weathered Polyethylene (wPE) microplastics. The Perna viridis were exposed chronically to three different environmentally relevant concentrations of wPE for 30 days, followed by a one-week depuration phase. There was no mortality observed in the control and exposed groups, but the feeding rate was observed to have substantially decreased in the group exposed to higher concentration (3 ??gL?????1) of wPE. It was also observed that a higher number of wPE particles accumulated in the intestine of exposed organisms. Interestingly, the present study revealed the presence of the substantial number of wPE particles in exposed organisms, which may adversely affect the internal organs as well as growth and reproduction. This study perceived that accumulation is marginally influenced by size of wPE. Similarly, biomarker analysis showed that wPE exposure significantly altered both the metabolism and histology of the internal organs of the exposed organisms. Overall, the study confirmed that the intestine was the most sensitive organ followed by gills, adductor muscles, and foot tissue adding new insights into the adverse effects of wPE in the marine ecosystem. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
B858VAKC,"Tyre and road wear particles - A calculation of generation, transport and release to water and soil with special regard to German roads","Tyre and road wear is one of the main emission sources of particulate plastics (microplastics). In this study, the emissions of tyre wear particles (TWP) which are annually generated on the German road network were calculated. Emissions are calculated by applying two different data sets of emission factors and the annual mileage for distinct vehicles and road types (urban roads, rural roads, highways). Environmental entry paths of tyre and road wear particles (TRWP) were considered including releases to ambient air, soils and surface waters. Road runoff treatment was taken into account differentiated into sewage systems in urban areas and at non-urban roads. This study identifies the soundest data available concerning emission factors, data on traffic and road systems as well as comprehensive information on road runoff treatment in Germany. Applying this data and assuming that 5% of the total emissions are ?????fine????? air-borne particles, the emissions of coarse ?????non-airborne????? particles are 75,200?????98,400 t/a;. the transport to road banks and soils near roads is 57,300?????65,400 t/a (66?????76%) including runoff and drift; 8700?????19,800 t/a (12?????20%) are released to surface waters. Due to lack of data, degradation in soils and surface waters was not considered. Besides soils, urban wastewater treatment plants are expected to be an important sink of TRWP assuming that most of the particles are incorporated in the sewage sludge. Due to the application of sewage sludge as a fertilizer, 1400?????2800 t/a TWP are currently deposited on agricultural areas. No reliable data was available to estimate the masses of TWP which are transported from freshwaters into the marine environment. Existing mitigation measures should be improved according to the principle of precaution by installation of road runoff treatment systems and retrofitting of existing plants regarding optimum fine particle retention. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
86VJGLT5,Theoretical and experimental calculation of underwater acoustic insertion loss of monolithic panels,"Underwater insertion loss of a material is a key parameter for many applications where acoustic requirements exist. Typically, environmental noise control and mitigation or SONAR are disciplines commonly demanding the knowledge of insertion losses of the material used for such purposes. Materials selected for these applications usually have good structural properties but also are lightweight and have good corrosion behavior and specific acoustic performances (e.g. baffling, transparency). In this sense, glass-reinforced plastics, as well as carbon fiber materials, synthetic or natural rubbers, urethane compounds, etc. are, more and more, part of tailored underwater structures, pods, covers, or acoustic windows. In this work, the underwater acoustic insertion losses of monolithic and isotropic typical panels are theoretically calculated and properly validated via measurements for a wide range of frequencies (10?????60 kHz) and angles of incidence (0?????80??). The theoretical calculation is carried out through the model proposed by G. Roche and based on the Brekhovskikh formulation, which is implemented within an ad hoc software tool developed by the authors (Sailor). The measurements were performed by the Centro Tecnol??gico Naval y del Mar ????? Marine Technology Center (CTN) in a freshwater-calibrated pool/tank located in the town of Cartagena (Spain). The results reveal a solid agreement between the measurements and the simulations carried out with the Sailor software, therefore validating the model proposed by Roche and shedding new light on a field where, to the best of the authors????? knowledge, previous investigations were scarce or lacking. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
QCEDDJL5,Influence of concrete properties on the initial biological colonisation of marine artificial structures,"Artificial marine infrastructures now cover large stretches of the available natural shoreline in many parts of the world. This is having a substantial impact on the local marine ecosystems as biodiverse natural hard substrata are being replaced with man-made structures, which have been shown to support lower levels of biodiversity. The ecological value of artificial coastal structures could be enhanced through careful design of pre-fabricated ecologically engineered units. Material selection is a critical parameter in the design of these units. To maximise the potential of concrete units to support and increase biodiversity, this paper explores the impact of binder composition, aggregate type and plasticizer on surface chemistry and early biofilm formation which influence subsequent colonisation. Experiments in the current study have shown that the addition of ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) to the mix can increase the levels of biodiversity supported while maintaining engineering performance requirements in terms of strength, chloride resistance and alkalinity. Conversely the aggregate type and use of a plasticizer have a minor influence. In particular, the addition of GGBS was shown to increase the biomass of diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae and barnacle abundance one month after immersion on both sheltered surfaces and those exposed to wave action. Results suggest that concrete composition can alter the surface chemistry of artificial structures and thereby can improve the ecological value of these structures as habitats for marine life. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
Q4FS9NW5,Plastic deformation and energy absorption of polycrystalline-like lattice structures,"Polycrystalline-like (PL) lattices are potential energy-absorbing structures composed of basic periodic mono-crystals arranged in different orientations. A series of numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the in-plane crushing resistance and energy absorption of different polycrystalline-like lattice structures. The finite element modelling (FEM) results clearly reveal that the PL lattice structures provide more excellent impact resistance and energy absorbing efficiency compared with conventional monocrystalline (MC) lattices. Compared with the four-cell ML lattice structure, the nine-cell PL lattice structures improve the mean crushing force (MCF) and specific energy absorption (SEA) by 1.5 times, and can effectively suppress the growth rate of the initial peak force (PF). The improvements in the MCF and the SEA originate from the grain boundaries of the PL lattice structures which restrain the evolution of the shear bands and change the shear failure mode of the MC lattice structures into a layer-by-layer progressive crushing mode. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
NDA5AXCX,Sub-axial deformation in oceanic lower crust: Insights from seismic reflection profiles in the Enderby Basin and comparison with the Oman ophiolite,"We analyzed high-quality seismic reflection profiles across the ocean-continent transition in the Enderby Basin between the Kerguelen Plateau and the Antarctic margin. There, we observe numerous high-amplitude dipping reflections in the lower oceanic crust which was accreted at a magmatic spreading center as testified by the almost uniform 6.4-7 km thick crust and its unfaulted, flat top basement. The deep reflections are rooting onto the Moho and are dipping both ridgeward and continentward. They occur in dense networks in mature oceanic crust as well as close to the continentward termination of oceanic crust and in the ocean-continent transition zone. The comparison with field observations in the Oman ophiolite suggests that these lower crustal dipping reflectors could correspond to syn-magmatic faults. In Oman, very high temperature (up to syn-magmatic), high temperature (sub-solidus plastic deformation) and low temperature (brittle) deformation coexist along the same fault over distances of a few hundred meters at Moho level. This very high temperature gradient may be explained by the sudden and intense interaction between crystallizing magmas and hydrothermal fluids induced by the episodic nucleation of faults in a context of continuous magmatic spreading. The igneous layering becomes extremely irregular compared to its monotonous sub-horizontal orientation away from the faults which, together with enhanced hydrothermal alteration restricted to the fault zones, might change the physical properties (velocity, density) and increase the reflectivity of syn-magmatic faults. We further speculate that these processes could explain the brightness of the lower crustal dipping reflectors observed in our seismic reflection data. Both the seismic reflection profiles of the Enderby Basin and the Oman ophiolite show evidence for syn-accretion tectonism at depth together with the systematic rotation of originally horizontal lava flows or originally vertical dikes, pre-dating cessation of magmatic activity. This indicates ubiquitous deformation processes within the axial zone of magmatic spreading centers. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
MZM5HTSU,Special issue on advanced corrosion-resistance materials and emerging applications. The progress on antifouling organic coating: From biocide to biomimetic surface,"The advancement in material science and engineering technology has led to the development of antifouling (AF) coatings which are cheaper, durable, less toxic, and safe to the environment. The use of AF coatings containing tributyltin compounds was prohibited at the beginning of 2003, this necessitated the development of environmentally friendly coatings. The fouling release coating (FRC) lacks biocides and has low surface energy, low elastic modulus with smooth surface properties, hence a better release effect to fouling organisms. Several functional coatings have been recently developed based on fouling release (FR) technology to combat the effects of biofouling. Here, we provide a brief overview of innovative technologies and recent developments based on FRCs, including silicone, modified fluorinated polymer, cross-linked coatings, amphiphilic copolymer coating, hydrogel coatings, and biomimetic coatings. We also highlight the key issues and shortcomings of innovative technologies based on FRCs. This may give new insights into the future development of marine AF coatings. ?? 2020",0
9J27P9DY,Experimental and numerical investigation of underwater composite repair with fibre reinforced polymers in corroded tubular offshore structural members under concentric and eccentric axial loads,"Repair of offshore steel structural members become essential due to the corrosive marine environment in which they exist. Structural repair using composite material has significant advantages in these cases than the conventional repair by welding or bolting steel sleeves. However, the composite repair technology with fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) is not very well established for their usage on load bearing offshore steel structural members either in underwater or above water conditions. The study had attempted to do a pilot experimental study on steel tubular members under the combination of axial compression and bending loads to address this gap in knowledge. The specimens were grouped into four categories: intact, corroded, repaired in air and repaired underwater. The repair scheme remained the same for in air and underwater repairs with one layer of glass and two layers of carbon fibre reinforced polymers, but with resin and repair methodology being different for both. The repaired specimens showed notable improvement in the ultimate strength from the corroded members to match the intact strength. Underwater repairs proved to be adequate to replicate the ultimate strength achieved by the conventional in air repairs. Investigations into parameters like load displacement behaviour, energy absorption, ductility and strain values also revealed that the underwater repair performed very similar to the conventional in air repair. A simplified Finite Element model simulating the repaired specimens was also presented in the paper which had predicted the experimental behaviour with great accuracy. In conclusion, the underwater and above water repair of structural steel tubular members using FRP composite materials seem a very viable solution for the corroded load bearing members in the offshore industry, however more detailed study on long term performance and cyclic behaviour of the composite repaired members is yet to be carried out. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
2IS4E9DU,Revealing of sugar utilization systems in Halomonas sp. YLGW01 and application for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) production with low-cost medium and easy recovery,"Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is a common polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) with potential as an alternative for petroleum-based plastics. Previously, we reported a new strain, Halomonas sp. YLGW01, which hyperproduces PHB with 94% yield using fructose. In this study, we examined the PHB production machinery of Halomonas sp. YLGW01 in more detail by deep-genome sequencing, which revealed a 3,453,067-bp genome with 65.1% guanine-cytosine content and 3054 genes. We found two acetyl-CoA acetyltransferases (Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, PhaA), one acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB), two PHB synthases (PhaC1, PhaC2), PHB depolymerase (PhaZ), and Enoyl-CoA hydratase (PhaJ) in the genome, along with two fructose kinases and fructose transporter systems, including the phosphotransferase system (PTS) and ATP-binding transport genes. We then examined the PHB production by Halomonas sp. YLGW01 using high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) containing fructose, glucose, and sucrose in sea water medium, resulting in 7.95 ?? 0.11 g/L PHB (content, 67.39 ?? 0.34%). PHB was recovered from Halomonas sp. YLGW01 using different detergents; the use of Tween 20 and SDS yielded micro-sized granules with high purity. Overall, these results reveal the distribution of PHB synthetic genes and the sugar utilization system in Halomonas sp. YLGW01 and suggest a possible method for PHB recovery. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
ZGUTK8VI,Chemicals sorbed to environmental microplastics are toxic to early life stages of aquatic organisms,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems, but little information is currently available on the dangers and risks to living organisms. In order to assess the ecotoxicity of environmental microplastics (MPs), samples were collected from the beaches of two islands in the Guadeloupe archipelago, Petit-Bourg (PB) located on the main island of Guadeloupe and Marie-Galante (MG) on the second island of the archipelago. These samples have a similar polymer composition with mainly polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). However, these two samples are very dissimilar with regard to their contamination profile and their toxicity. MPs from MG contain more lead, cadmium and organochlorine compounds while those from PB have higher levels of copper, zinc and hydrocarbons. The leachates of these two samples of MPs induced sublethal effects on the growth of sea urchins and on the pulsation frequency of jellyfish ephyrae but not on the development of zebrafish embryos. The toxic effects are much more marked for samples from the PB site than those from the MG site. This work demonstrates that MPs can contain high levels of potentially bioavailable toxic substances that may represent a significant ecotoxicological risk, particularly for the early life stages of aquatic animals. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
SPE8CI5B,Responses to environmentally relevant microplastics are species-specific with dietary habit as a potential sensitivity indicator,"There is a lack of information on understanding how marine organisms respond to environmentally relevant microplastics (MP) which hampers decision making for waste management strategies. This study addresses this information gap by determining whether responses to MPs are species specific within a functional group. Benthic residing sea urchins, Psammechinus miliaris and Paracentrotus lividus were used as a case study. Psammechinus miliaris are strong omnivores with dietary intake including hard components (e.g. shell, tubeworms) and therefore likely to cope with the ingestion of MPs, while P. lividus are strong herbivores consuming softer dietary items (e.g. biofilms, algae) and therefore more likely sensitive. Responses to environmentally relevant MPs were conducted across two trials. Trial one determined the impact of short term (24 h) external exposure to storm-like sediment resuspension of MP concentrations (53 ??m polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 25,000 MP L???1) compared to a control without MPs. No significant impacts were observed for both P. lividus and P. miliaris on metabolic rate or righting time, and urchins were able to remove MPs from the body surface using pedicellariae and cilia. Trial two determined the impact of medium term (2 months) ingestion of a diet laced with PVC MPs (59 ??m) at an inclusion rate of 0.5% mass and a control diet (without MPs) on somatic growth and animal condition. The ingestion of MPs did not significantly impact P. miliaris but significantly reduced the alimentary index within P. lividus, indicating a compromised nutritional state. This study shows that responses to microplastics are species-specific and therefore cannot be generalized. Furthermore, feeding habit could act as a potential indicator for sensitivity to MP ingestion which will be important for impact assessments of plastic pollution and management strategies. ?? 2020",0
22DFRUHZ,"Abundance, composition and sources of marine debris trawled-up in the fishing grounds along the north-east Arabian coast","The pollution due to marine debris is a serious environmental threat in many parts of the world. The abundance of marine debris, composition and its distribution over the seafloor along north-east coast of Arabian coast was studied through trawl based swept method. Experimental fishing was conducted fortnightly using shrimp bottom trawl and collected debris was categorized as per standard protocols. A total of 1077 pieces of debris (11.7 kg dry weight) were collected from 25 hauls. The average number and weight of debris were 943 items/km2 and 10.2 kg/km2 respectively. The estimated total marine debris along this coast was 379 t (dry weight). Plastic-based debris contributed maximum (87.1%) to the total debris collected in numbers and among this, plastic bags and food wrappers were dominant. Debris produced by shoreline/recreational activities comprised the major source of debris (88.6%) along this coast. This study provides the evidence that the effective use of available fishing trawlers and co-management practices (?????Make fishers friend?????) can help to remove the seabed debris. The base data generated through this study would facilitate region-based effective control and management of plastic debris pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
JC25BRGA,Microplastics do not increase bioaccumulation of petroleum hydrocarbons in Arctic zooplankton but trigger feeding suppression under co-exposure conditions,"Arctic sea ice has alarmingly high concentrations of microplastics (MPs). Additionally, sea ice reduction in the Arctic is opening new opportunities for the oil and maritime industries, which could increase oil pollution in the region. Yet knowledge of the effects of co-exposure to MPs and crude oil on Arctic zooplankton is lacking. We tested the influence of MPs (polyethylene, 20.7 ??m) on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bioaccumulation and oil toxicity in the key arctic copepod Calanus hyperboreus after exposure to oil with and without dispersant. Up to 30% of the copepods stopped feeding and fecal pellet production rates were reduced after co-exposure to oil (1 ??L L???1) and MPs (20 MPs mL???1). The PAH body burden was 3 times higher in feeding than in non-feeding copepods. Copepods ingested both MPs and crude oil droplets. MPs did not influence bioaccumulation of PAHs in copepods or their fecal pellets, but chemical dispersant increased bioaccumulation, especially of ???4 ring-PAHs. Our results suggest that MPs do not act as vectors of PAHs in Arctic marine food webs after oil spills, but, at high concentrations (20 MPs mL???1), MPs can trigger behavioral stress responses (e.g., feeding suppression) to oil pollution in zooplankton. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
L6G5DWME,Drivers of Pine Island Glacier speed-up between 1996 and 2016,"Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica is among the fastest changing glaciers worldwide. Over the last 2 decades, the glacier has lost in excess of a trillion tons of ice, or the equivalent of 3mm of sea level rise. The ongoing changes are thought to have been triggered by ocean-induced thinning of its floating ice shelf, grounding line retreat, and the associated reduction in buttressing forces. However, other drivers of change, such as large-scale calving and changes in ice rheology and basal slipperiness, could play a vital, yet unquantified, role in controlling the ongoing and future evolution of the glacier. In addition, recent studies have shown that mechanical properties of the bed are key to explaining the observed speed-up. Here we used a combination of the latest remote sensing datasets between 1996 and 2016, data assimilation tools, and numerical perturbation experiments to quantify the relative importance of all processes in driving the recent changes in Pine Island Glacier dynamics. We show that (1) calving and ice shelf thinning have caused a comparable reduction in ice shelf buttressing over the past 2 decades; that (2) simulated changes in ice flow over a viscously deforming bed are only compatible with observations if large and widespread changes in ice viscosity and/or basal slipperiness are taken into account; and that (3) a spatially varying, predominantly plastic bed rheology can closely reproduce observed changes in flow without marked variations in ice-internal and basal properties. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to its evolving ice thickness, calving processes and a heterogeneous bed rheology play a key role in the contemporary evolution of Pine Island Glacier. ?? 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

CHZ9SVB8,"Environmental fate, toxicity and risk management strategies of nanoplastics in the environment: Current status and future perspectives","Tiny plastic particles considered as emerging contaminants have attracted considerable interest in the last few years. Mechanical abrasion, photochemical oxidation and biological degradation of larger plastic debris result in the formation of microplastics (MPs, 1 ??m to 5 mm) and nanoplastics (NPs, 1 nm to 1000 nm). Compared with MPs, the environmental fate, ecosystem toxicity and potential risks associated with NPs have so far been less explored. This review provides a state-of-the-art overview of current research on NPs with focus on currently less-investigated fields, such as the environmental fate in agroecosystems, migration in porous media, weathering, and toxic effects on plants. The co-transport of NPs with organic contaminants and heavy metals threaten human health and ecosystems. Furthermore, NPs may serve as a novel habitat for microbial colonization, and may act as carriers for pathogens (i.e., bacteria and viruses). An integrated framework is proposed to better understand the interrelationships between NPs, ecosystems and the human society. In order to fully understand the sources and sinks of NPs, more studies should focus on the total environment, including freshwater, ocean, groundwater, soil and air, and more attempts should be made to explore the aging and aggregation of NPs in environmentally relevant conditions. Considering the fact that naturally-weathered plastic debris may have distinct physicochemical characteristics, future studies should explore the environmental behavior of naturally-aged NPs rather than synthetic polystyrene nanobeads. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
MF93PRGD,Response of rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots to nanoplastic treatment at seedling stage,"Potential adverse effects of nanoplastics (NPs) on marine organisms have received increased attention in recent years. In contrast, few data are available on terrestrial plants, especially on the mechanisms for transport of NPs in plants and phytotoxicity (at both phenotypic and molecular levels) of plants induced by NPs. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a microcosm study in which hydroponically-cultured rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings were exposed to polystyrene (PS)-NPs at 0, 10, 50, and 100 mg L???1 for 16 d and examined for morphological and physiological phenotypes and transcriptomics. Laser confocal scanning micrographs confirmed PS-NPs were uptaken by rice roots, greatly benefitted from the transport activity of aquaporin in rice roots. The significant enhancement (p &lt; 0.05) of antioxidant enzyme activities reflected the oxidative stress response of rice roots upon exposure to PS-NPs. Treatment by PS-NPs decreased root length and increased lateral root numbers. Carbon metabolism was activated (e.g., increased carbon and soluble sugar contents) whereas jasmonic acid and lignin biosynthesis were inhibited. The present study demonstrated the likelihood for transport of PS-NPs in rice roots and induced phytotoxicity by PS-NPs, which should inspire further investigations into the potential human health risks from rice consumption. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
IDQIUA73,Application of internal persistent fluorescent fibers in tracking microplastics in vivo processes in aquatic organisms,"Tracking the in vivo transportation and localization of microplastics is the prerequisite for a better understanding of the toxicity but has not been reported yet. Fluorescent microbeads are widely used for tracking in the laboratory, whereas the most abundant microplastic (e.g., fiber) found in the field is rarely adapted. In this study, we used fiber slicer and blades to cut spinning materials into fluorescent micro-sized fibers with various lengths. Fiber slicer and blades are efficient tools to produce specific lengths of fibers. The microfibers showed a specific color under the ultraviolet irradiation; therefore, these microfibers can be clearly visualized when they are within aquatic organisms, such as water flea, shrimp, medaka, and zebrafish, which enables us to observe the whole biological processes of microfibers directly. Thus, the present study provides a novel method of microfibers preparation, and this kind of fluorescent fiber is applicable to be an efficient and convenient tracer for in vivo process observation and potential toxicological analysis in the future. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
7L6WYDJ9,Mechanical optimization of concrete with recycled pet fibres based on a statistical-experimental study,"Discarded polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles have damaged our ecosystem. Problems of marine fauna conservation and land fertility have been related to the disposal of these materials. Recycled fibre is an opportunity to reduce the levels of waste in the world and increase the mechanical performance of the concrete. PET as concrete reinforcement has demonstrated ductility and postcracking strength. However, its performance could be optimized. This study considers a statisticalexperimental analysis to evaluate recycled PET fibre reinforced concrete with various fibre dose and aspect ratio. 120 samples were experimented under workability, compressive, flexural, and splitting tensile tests. The results pointed out that the fibre dose has more influence on the responses than its fibre aspect ratio, with statistical relation on the tensional toughness, equivalent flexural strength ratio, volumetric weight, and the number of fibres. Moreover, the fibre aspect ratio has a statistical impact on the tensional toughness. In general, the data indicates that the optimal recycled PET fibre reinforced concrete generates a superior performance than control samples, with an improvement similar to those reinforced with virgin fibres. ?? 2021 by the authors.

E4QBYR5I,Ingestion of nano/micro plastic particles by the mussel Mytilus coruscus is size dependent,"Plastic particles are thought to accumulate in aquatic organisms and cause potential physiological effects. The uneven sizes of plastic particles may affect the ingestion by marine filter feeding bivalves and may lead to differential further physiological effects. To tackle this scientific question, we investigated the size dependent ingestion and dynamic accumulation of nano/micro plastic particles with different diameters (0.07, 0.5, 5, 10 and 100 ??m) in the thick shell mussel Mytilus coruscus. The accumulation of particles in gill, digestive tract and mantle of mussels was measured after 3, 15, 87 h exposure and following 87 h depuration. The results showed that particle ingestion was negatively size dependant and positively related to time in digestive tract. In mantle, particles accumulated over the depuration time with a delay, indicating the translocation of particles. Moreover, our results showed that gill was not a target tissue for steady particle accumulation but the digestive tract was. This study showed size dependent and dynamic ingestion of nano/micro particles in mussels which are one of the main marine organisms for accumulating microplastics. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
XVHC5H8R,Filling in the knowledge gap: Observing MacroPlastic litter in South Africa's rivers,"Only 12% of the world's published plastic research includes references to Africa despite it being a significant contributor to the global plastic waste and mismanagement problem ( 88.5% of Africa's plastic waste is mismanaged). Ocean plastics are transported from land by rivers to the sea. However, source contextualization is complex. Many African rivers predominantly run alongside human settlements that host informal waste dumpsites. In this study a simple cost effective, easily deployed, consistent and replicable survey methodology was employed. The study quantified macroplastic in three rivers discharging into Algoa Bay, South Africa. The results indicated that industrial Swartkops and metropolitan Baakens Rivers both illustrate moderate plastic pollution (>3000 plastic particles/day), with the relatively natural Sundays River to showing minimal evidence of river macro plastic (<100 plastic particles/day). The types of plastic were noted using the RIMMEL app (premier African implementation), enabling proportional comparison of different plastic litter types to be completed. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
S5WEC7TC,Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of plastic particles in surface waters of the Western Black Sea,"Microplastic abundances have been studied intensively in the last years in marine and freshwater environments worldwide. Though several articles have been published about the Mediterranean Sea, only few studies about the Black Sea exist. The Black Sea drains into the Mediterranean Sea and may therefore significantly contribute to the Mediterranean marine pollution. So far, only very few articles have been published about micro-, meso- and macroplastic abundances in the Western Black Sea. In order to fill this knowledge gap and to decipher the number of plastics on the water surface, 12 samples were collected from surface waters with a neustonic net (mesh size 200 ??m) in the Black Sea close to the Danube Delta and the Romanian shore. Organic matter was digested and plastic particles were isolated by density separation. The results of visual inspection, pyrolysis GC-MS (for microplastics) and ATR-FTIR (for mesoplastics >5 mm) revealed an average concentration of 7 plastic particles/m??, dominated by fibers (???76%), followed by foils (???13%) and fragments (???11%). Only very few spherules were detected. The polymers polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) dominated which is in line with other studies analyzing surface waters from rivers in Western Europe as well as in China. Statistical analyses show that the plastic concentration close to the mouth of the Danube River was significantly higher than at four nearshore regions along the Romanian and Bulgarian coastline. This could be explained by plastic inputs from the Danube River into the western part of the Black Sea. ?? 2020 The Authors",1
BTYBPT9U,"Microplastic pollution in surface seawater of Sanggou Bay, China: Occurrence, source and inventory","Microplastic pollution in marine environments has become a major global environmental issue. However, the source of microplastics in marine environments is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the distribution and the source of microplastics in surface seawater from Sanggou Bay, China. The results showed that the average abundance of microplastics was 20.06 ?? 4.73 items/L, which represented a medium and high level relative to other sea areas. Microplastics of <0.5 mm dominated. Most particles were granular and transparent, and polyethylene was the dominant polymer. We estimated that 62.76% of the microplastics originated from mariculture facilities, an indication that mariculture contributes significantly to microplastics pollution, and calculated that 96.15 kg was present in surface seawater of Sanggou Bay. Our findings indicated that more attention should be paid to mariculture-derived microplastics pollution in the future. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
A89HSG6W,"Microplastic uptake in commercial fishes from the Bohai Sea, China","Microplastic (MP) pollution has become an emerging global concern in marine environments, but research on the uptake of MPs by commercial marine fish is relatively sparse. In this study, 29 commercial fish species (n = 584) with different feeding habits and trophic levels were collected from 8 sites along the Bohai Sea for MP uptake analysis. Approximately 85.4% of the total fish among all species ingested MPs, and there was an average abundance of 2.14 items/individual or 0.043 items/g of wet weight. Compared with other studies, MP pollution in fishes from the Bohai Sea was relatively moderate. The MPs were predominantly fibrous in shape and were cellophane, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) in polymer composition. The highest abundance and polymer composition of MPs was observed in benthivores, suggesting that they might ingest these MPs from their food. The small fish Konosirus punctatus, which had a high level of MPs, may increase the risk of human exposure to the MPs when it is dried and consumed. Moreover, the spatial variation of MPs was determined in terms of abundance, shape composition, and major polymer types, but there was no marked relationship between MP abundance and the trophic levels of fish. Overall, this study provides a basis for the ecological risk assessment of MPs in fish and for a health risk assessment for human beings. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
FAYREPUS,In the business of dirty oceans: Overview of startups and entrepreneurs managing marine plastic,"Plastic pollution, especially in marine environments, is a global problem that is currently inadequately managed. Solutions for marine plastic can occur through policy, behavior change and infrastructure improvements, but also through entrepreneurial ventures and technological innovations. Currently, information about these ventures and innovations is scattered and lacks coherence. This study presents the first comprehensive overview of entrepreneurial and SME led solutions for marine plastic by analyzing a database of 105 SMEs categorized into four functions: prevention, collection, transformation and monitoring. We find that small businesses are successfully commercializing goods and services to reduce the damage of plastics on the marine environment through innovative business models, with a steep growth of startups founded between 2016 and 2019. However, efforts to manage marine plastic are still underdeveloped in many areas, including microplastic management and monitoring. Practitioners, policymakers and researchers can utilize the database to identify solutions, best practices, synergies and avenues for further research, such as quantifying the environmental impacts of this industry. ?? 2020",0
FRGY59IF,Photo aging and fragmentation of polypropylene food packaging materials in artificial seawater,"Plastic litters in marine environment usually contain varied types and contents of additives that can significantly affect the photochemical aging and fragmentation process of microplastics (MPs). This study investigated the photo aging process of two common polypropylene (PP) food packaging materials (i.e., meal box and tea cup) in artificial seawater within 12 d of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Results revealed that the aging of both plastic materials were critically inhibited compared with pure PP, indicating that PP food packaging materials in natural seawater may share longer aging time than pure ones. GC-MS analysis revealed that antioxidant Irgafos 168 (tris (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite) was the dominant additive in these plastic materials. Photo reaction between Irgafos 168 and hydroperoxide species on the surface of MPs to prevent the formation of hydroxyl radical was the possible mechanism for the inhibiting effects. After antioxidant was exhausted, its photo degradation products could become the dominant contributor to influence the aging process of MPs. This is the first work exploring the role of antioxidant on the aging process of PP MPs in simulated ocean environment. The findings could be of great help for unraveling the effect of antioxidants on the aging-related environmental risk of hydrocarbon plastics in ocean environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
6P2RBA2Q,Extraction of microplastics from commonly used sea salts in India and their toxicological evaluation,"Microplastics (MPs) are one of the marine debris, accumulated in the ocean as a result of the successive breakdown of a large piece of plastics over several years. MPs are about less than 5 mM, have a detrimental impact on marine organisms/products (seafood/sea salts) and therefore they are considered as a global environmental pollutant. The occurrence and impact of MPs in commercial sea salts that are consumed by humans are not well studied so far. In the present study, we attempted to characterize and evaluate the in vitro toxicity of isolated MPs. Here, we have used ten brands of commercial sea salts of different origins for the identification and characterization of MPs. The average abundance of MPs in all commercial brands is &lt; 700 MP/kg and the particle size range between 5.2 mM and 3.8 ??M. The most common types of MPs were identified as fragments, fibers, and pellets. By Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), it was found that the MPs in abundance were made of cellophane (CP), polystyrene (PR), polyamide (PA) and polyarylether (PAR). Further, in vitro toxicity assessment revealed that HEK-293 cells get detached upon treatment with MPs (MIC-75 ??g mL-1) Consequently, the AO/EB dual staining confirmed that the induction and rate of apoptosis were comparatively higher in microplastic treated HEK-293 cells. Taken together, the MPs identified are the origin of anthropogenic derivatives and they exert a lethal effect on human cells, which might be associated with health risk complications in human beings. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
N3MUJMTZ,"Concentration, anisotropic and apparent colour effects on optical reflectance properties of virgin and ocean-harvested plastics","We present reflectance measurements collected from virgin and ocean-harvested plastics. Virgin plastics included high and low density polyethylene (HDPE, LDPE), polypropylene (PP) as well as polystyrene (PS). Ocean-harvested plastics were ropes, sheets, foam, pellets and fragmented items previously trawled from the North Pacific Garbage Patch. Nadir viewing angles and plastic pixel coverage were varied to advance our understanding of how reflectance shape and magnitude can be influenced by these parameters. We also investigated the effect of apparent colour of plastics on the measured reflectance from the ultraviolet (UV - 350 nm), visible, near to shortwave infrared (NIR, SWIR - 2500 nm). Statistical analyses indicated that the spectral reflectance of the plastics was significantly correlated to the percentage pixel coverage. There was no clear relationship between the reflectance observed and the viewing nadir angle but dampened materials seemed to be more isotropic (near-Lambertian) than their dry counterparts. A loss in reflectance was also determined between dry and wet plastics. Location of absorption features was not affected by the apparent colour of objects. In general, ocean-harvested plastics shared more identical absorption features ( 960, 1215, 1440, 1732, 1920 nm) and had lower reflectance intensity compared to the virgin plastics ( 980 nm). Prospects for satellite retrieval of plastic type and pixel plastic coverage are discussed based on Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) signal simulated through radiative transfer computation using the documented plastic reflectances. Non-linear relationships between TOA reflectance and plastic coverage were observed depending on wavelength and plastic type. Most of the plastics analysed impact significantly the TOA signal but two plastic types did not produce strong signal at TOA (hard fragments, LDPE). Nevertheless, all plastic types produced detectable signals when observations were simulated within the sunglint direction. The measurements collected in this study are an extension to available high quality spectral reference libraries and can support further research in developing remote sensing algorithms for marine litter. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
RBP3VUBS,"Microplastic contamination in surface waters of the K??????k??ekmece Lagoon, Marmara Sea (Turkey): Sources and areal distribution","The distribution of freshwater and marine microplastics (MPs) varies due to the difference in fresh and seawater densities and MP sources. This study aims to investigate the abundance of MPs and their possible sources in surface waters of different ecosystems, such as sea, lagoon, and lake. We classified MPs in terms of their color and type and established the relationship between the MPs in surface waters with different characteristics. The mean MP abundance (33 particles L???1) detected herein was higher than that in the previously conducted studies. Fragment particles (37.95%) were determined to be the dominant MP type, and the predominant MP color was blue (75.28%). As for the seasonal MP distribution, its highest content (48.03 particles L???1) was observed in autumn, unlike that reported by other studies. The findings of this study reveal the effects of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge and current flow on the MP distribution in the study area. This study aims to provide representative data on the MP abundance and distribution, as well as MP-affecting parameters for similar aquatic areas in other parts of the world. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
H3GYHGVM,Marine mussel-based biomarkers as risk indicators to assess oceanic region-specific microplastics impact potential,"Microplastics (MPs) pollution in the ocean is an area of growing concern. Marine fauna subject to MPs exposure from various environmental sources are most likely to have detrimental effects on their immune system. However, studies of potential risks of MPs on marine ecosystems in light of environmental concentrations are largely limited. To this end, we presented an approach for assessing potential impact of MPs on marine ecosystems based on marine mussel Mytilus-based probabilistic risk assessment framework. The immunotoxic-based biomarkers of Mytilus were used to assess the impact of MPs on marine environment appraised with datasets by compiling oceanic region-specific and comprehensive MPs???environment studies along with published toxicity experiments. The immunological effects of MPs on lysosomal destabilization and phagocytosis in hemocytes of Mytilus were reconstructed as the concentration?????response functions. We assessed the risk for marine environment exceeding a threshold of Mytilus-based immunological toxicity based on the benchmark concentration (BMC) approach corresponding to a 10% inhibition effect (BMC10). We estimated BMC10 values for inhibitions of lysosomal membrane stability and phagocytosis to be 1.4 and 0.4 mg L???1, respectively. Here we showed that the overall MPs-associated impact potential was low among South Pacific Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and South Atlantic Ocean. However, we found that MPs from North Pacific Ocean were very likely (&gt;90% probability) to pose a potential threat to marine mussels. Our findings have important implications for understanding the linked relationships between environmental MPs and likelihood of exposure risk for marine organisms in different oceanic regions around the world. We suggest that Mytilus-based risk indicator for estimating risk metrics of essential marine ecosystems posed by environmentally relevant MPs concentrations can help inform practices for the sustainable management and for mitigating the environmental MPs-induced negative impact on marine organisms. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
UEG2LVFY,The difference of aggregation mechanism between microplastics and nanoplastics: Role of Brownian motion and structural layer force,"Main finding: Physical process controls aggregation behavior of MPs, while Brownian motion and structural layer force dominate that of NPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd In recent years, microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have attracted worldwide attention because of the potential risks they pose to aquatic environments, but there are few studies on the difference of aggregation mechanism between MPs and NPs. In this study, 100 nm and 1 ??m polystyrene plastics were selected as models to explore the aggregation mechanism of MPs/NPs under different aquatic environments. The influence of ion species and concentrations on the aggregation behaviors and kinetics were systematically investigated to predict the effects of water quality on the occurrence form of MPs and NPs based on DLVO theory and revised modified Smoluchowski theory. Results showed concentration, valence and hydrated ability of cations jointly affected the aggregation behavior of NPs. The critical coagulation concentration ratio of cations were consistent with Schulze-Hardy rules. But the different aggregation rate coefficients of same valent cations were ascribed to the structural layer force. Anion species played a role in the reaction-controlled regime by producing hydrogen ions to neutralize negative charges on NPs surfaces. Due to the strong Brownian motion and structural layer force, NPs would be stable in freshwater but preferentially aggregated when transport through brackish water, estuaries, eutrophication and high hardness areas and sea water, forming the accumulation hot spots of NPs in the sediment. While for MPs, physical process controlled the aggregation mechanism of them, leading to high stability in natural water and eventually transporting into marine environments. This study provided a theoretical foundation for assessing the transport, distribution, fate and ecological risks of MPs and NPs in realistic aquatic environments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
CMK5LCXG,Microplastics accumulate to thin layers in the stratified Baltic Sea,"In the Baltic Sea, water is stratified due to differences in density and salinity. The stratification prevents water from mixing, which could affect sinking rates of microplastics in the sea. We studied the accumulation of microplastics to halocline and thermocline. We sampled water with a 100 ??m plankton net from vertical transects between halo- and thermocline, and a 30 L water sampler from the end of halocline and the beginning of thermocline. Thereafter, microplastics in the whole sample volumes were analyzed with imaging Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The plankton net results showed that water column between halo- and thermoclines contained on average 0.92 ?? 0.61 MP m???3 (237 ?? 277 ng/m???3; mean ?? SD), whereas the 30 L samples from the end of halocline and the beginning of thermocline contained 0.44 ?? 0.52 MP L???1 (106 ?? 209 ng L???1). Hence, microplastics are likely to accumulate to thin layers in the halocline and thermocline. The vast majority of the found microplastics were polyethylene, polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate, which are common plastic types. We did not observe any trend between the density of microplastics and the sampling depth, probably because biofilm formation affected the sinking rates of the particles. Our results indicate the need to sample deeper water layers in addition to surface waters at least in the stratified water bodies to obtain a comprehensive overview of the abundance of microplastics in the aquatic environment. ?? 2020 The Author(s) Microplastic concentrations were high in halo- and thermoclines compared to waters surrounding them. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",1
WIS4U9Y5,Potential effects of biodegradable single-use items in the sea: Polylactic acid (PLA) and solitary ascidians,"With conventional plastics posing a great threat to marine organisms, and potentially also to humans, bio-based, biodegradable plastics are being offered as an ecological solution by which to reduce the environmental impact. Inside compost facilities, bioplastics that comply with the EN 13432:2000 international standard biodegrade almost completely within 180 days. However, outside compost facilities, and specifically in marine environments, these bioplastics may have a similar effect to that of fossil-fuel based plastics. Here we investigated the effects of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polylactic acid (PLA) single-use cups and plates on a solitary ascidian's biological and ecological features. Both PET and PLA microparticles reduced the fertilization rate of Microcosmus exasperatus, with no significant difference between materials. Accumulation rates in adult M. exasperatus exposed to micronized PET and PLA particles at two concentrations were similar for both the bioplastic material and the conventional plastic particles, with no significant difference between the two materials. A microbial-based digestive protocol was developed in order to recover the bioplastic material from ascidian tissue and reduce any material-loss caused by the known digestion protocols. Finally, PET plates submerged for three months in the Red Sea exhibited a significantly higher community richness and cover area in comparison to PLA plates, which did not provide a firm substrate for settlers. Indeed, coverage by the solitary ascidian Herdmania momus was significantly higher on PET plates. The current study demonstrates that discarded bioplastic products may have similar effects to those of conventional plastics on marine organism fertilization and biological accumulation, emphasizing the need to revise both the production and marketing of ?????biodegradable????? and ?????compostable????? plastics in order to prevent a further negative impact on ecosystems due to the mismanagement of bioplastic products. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Bioplastic products may have similar effects to those of conventional plastics on marine organism fertilization and biological accumulation, emphasizing the need to revise both the production and marketing of ?????biodegradable????? and ?????compostable????? plastics. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
SMDE24VF,The gut retention time of microplastics in barnacle naupliar larvae from different climatic zones and marine habitats,"Microplastic ingestion has been widely documented in marine zooplankton, but the retention time of microplastics in their digestive gut are still poorly studied, especially among species from different climatic zones and marine habitats. This study evaluated the ingestion and gut retention time of four sizes of fluorescent microplastic beads (1.3, 7.3, 10.6, and 19.0 ??m) in stage II naupliar larvae of nine barnacle species from different habitats (epibiotic on turtles, mangroves, coral reefs, and rocky shores) and climatic zones (subtropical/tropical and temperate). Microbeads were not lethal to all species (climatic zones/habitats) tested from the four sizes of non-fluorescent virgin microbeads (1.7, 6.8, 10.4 and 19.0 ??m, each at concentrations 1, 10, 100, and 1000 beads mL???1). Gut retention time of microplastic beads in barnacle naupliar larvae significantly increased with decreasing size. Microbeads resided in digestive tracts generally 3?????4 times longer in rocky shore and coral reef barnacles than in muddy shore and epibiotic ones. However, species from different climatic zone did not differ in retention time. Our results suggested nauplius larvae from rocky shore and coral reef barnacles appear to be more susceptible to the impacts of longer retained microplastics (e.g., toxic chemicals present on the surface). ?? 2020 Microplastic retention times are size- and species-dependent with muddy shore barnacles the most efficient in egesting microplastics. ?? 2020",0
JKS24PG4,Microplastics in wastewater outlets of Bandar Abbas city (Iran): A potential point source of microplastics into the Persian Gulf,"Wastewater discharge is considered to be a significant point source of microplastic (MPs) release into the marine environment. This study is the first attempt to quantify MPs released from the wastewater outfall from Bandar Abbas City into the Persian Gulf. Two wastewater discharge stations at Gursuzan and Suru were sampled. MPs were isolated by an oxidative procedure and subsequent density separation using ZnCl2 solution. The average MP concentration in wastewater and sludge were 70.66 (??14.12, SD) MP.35 L???1 and 6070 (??807.25) MPs.kg???1, respectively at Confidence Level (CL) (95.0%). The most commonly recovered polymers were polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) in all size classes. Our findings provides a baseline of MP concentration in wastewater streams and slurry that is discharged from the Bandar Abbas wastewater treatment facility into the Persian Gulf. This highlights the need to undertake more studies at water treatment plants in the region for a realistic assessment of MP discharge into the Persian Gulf. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0

U3UXL6WD,"Microplastics in three typical benthic species from the Arctic: Occurrence, characteristics, sources, and environmental implications","Microplastics (MPs) in the Arctic have raised increasing concern, but knowledge on MP contamination in benthic organisms from Arctic shelf regions, e.g., the Chukchi Sea is still limited. Therefore, the present study investigated the occurrence, characteristics, sources, and environmental implications of MPs in the three most common benthic species, namely sea anemone (Actiniidae und.), deposit-feeding starfish (Ctenodiscus crispatus), and snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio), from the Chukchi Sea. The abundances of MPs in the three benthic species were significantly greater than those from the Bering Sea, but lower than those from other regions globally. The top three compositions of MPs in the three species were polyester, nylon, and polyethylene terephthalate. The detection limit for MP size in the present study was 0.03 mm and the mean size of MP in the three species was 0.89 ?? 0.06 mm. The surfaces of MPs found in the starfish and crabs were covered with many attachments, cracks, and hollows, while the surfaces of MPs found in the sea anemones were smooth, which was likely a consequence of different feeding behaviors. There was a significantly positive correlation between the abundances of MPs and other anthropogenic substances. The mean MP abundances in the sea anemones ranged from 0.2 items/individual to 1.7 items/individual, which was significantly higher than that in the deposit-feeding starfish (0.1?????1.4 items/individual) and snow crabs (0.0?????0.6 items/individual). Sea anemones inhabiting lower latitudes ingested relatively higher levels of MPs than those inhabiting higher latitudes. The MP abundances in the sea anemones are significantly and positively correlated with the seasonal reduced ratio of sea ice coverage from August to September. Our findings indicate that sea anemones could function as a bioindicator of MP pollution, and that the MPs in the benthos from the Chukchi Sea might originate from the melting sea ice, fishery activities and ocean currents. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",0
224PNS34,Fluorescence sensing of microplastics on surfaces,"Microplastics, nanoplastics and related products have been recently found in marine ecosystems worldwide, calling for new analytical methods for rapid detection and risk assessment. Fluorescence is a sensitive technique that when used with polarity probes can potentially detect low-polarity plastic particles in environments. Here, we evaluated the fluorescence technique to sense polystyrene microparticles directly on salt, silica and sand surfaces, using Nile Red and pyrene as polarity probes. Results show that all probes displayed fluorescence on silica and sand, whereas strong fluorescence quenching was observed on NaCl. Polystyrene particles increase the fluorescence intensity due to probe migration into their nonpolar microenvironment. In the presence of polystyrene, the spectra of Nile Red are shifted to shorter wavelengths, while the ratio of vibronic bands I1/I3 of fluorescence of pyrene decreases to about 1. Pyrene showed similar sensitivity toward surface-modified carboxyl polystyrene particles. On NaCl, the emission of pyrene increases linearly with polystyrene content for concentrations from 0.5 to 20 ??g/g. The detection limit of polystyrene microparticles on natural sea salt using pyrene as probe is about 0.2 ??g/g, while on sand, the sensitivity is about one order of magnitude lower. Overall, although being of relatively low selectivity, the fluorescence technique can be used to determine a maximum content of plastic particles of few micrometers size with little sample preparation. Fluorescence, when used in conjunction with pyrene probe, allows for detection and quantification of microplastic particles in the sub-ppm range. ?? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",0
T9Q4CG58,Microbial carrying capacity and carbon biomass of plastic marine debris,"Trillions of plastic debris fragments are floating at sea, presenting a substantial surface area for microbial colonization. Numerous cultivation-independent surveys have characterized plastic-associated microbial biofilms, however, quantitative studies addressing microbial carbon biomass are lacking. Our confocal laser scanning microscopy data show that early biofilm development on polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and glass substrates displayed variable cell size, abundance, and carbon biomass, whereas these parameters stabilized in mature biofilms. Unexpectedly, plastic substrates presented lower volume proportions of photosynthetic cells after 8 weeks, compared to glass. Early biofilms displayed the highest proportions of diatoms, which could influence the vertical transport of plastic debris. In total, conservative estimates suggest 2.1 ?? 1021 to 3.4 ?? 1021 cells, corresponding to about 1% of the microbial cells in the ocean surface microlayer (1.5 ?? 103 to 1.1 ?? 104 tons of carbon biomass), inhabit plastic debris globally. As an unnatural addition to sea surface waters, the large quantity of cells and biomass carried by plastic debris has the potential to impact biodiversity, autochthonous ecological functions, and biogeochemical cycles within the ocean. ?? 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Society for Microbial Ecology.",0
2QZ9XVLW,Plastic waste from marine environment: Demonstration of possible routes for recycling by different manufacturing technologies,"The increasing amount of marine plastic waste poses challenges including, not only the collection, but also the subsequent recyclability of the plastic. An artificial accelerated weathering procedure was developed, which modelled the marine environment and investigated the recyclability of weathered and non-weathered PET. Marine conditions were simulated for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottle material and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) cap material. It consisted of 2520 h cyclical weathering, alternating the sample between a salt spray and a Xenon-chamber?????this corresponds to roughly 3?????4 years on the surface of an ocean. It was proved that the molecular weight of PET is a function of weathering time and can be described mathematically. Microscopic examination of the surface of the PET bottles and HDPE caps proved that these surfaces were damaged. After weathering, manufacturing tests were performed on the PET material by extrusion, injection moulding, 3D printing and thermoforming. Quantitative comparison between products manufactured by the same technology was performed in order to compare the qualities of products made from original PET, non-weathered PET waste, which was the example of classical recycling, and weathered PET. In the case of products made from weathered PET, certain mechanical and optical properties (e.g. impact strength and transparency) were significantly impaired compared to the original PET and the recycled, non-weathered PET. Certain other properties (e.g. strength and rigidity) did not change significantly. It was proved that the samples from weathered plastic material can be successfully recycled mechanically and used to manufacture plastic products. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
NR9JDZEE,Impact of microplastic addition on degradation of dibutyl phthalate in offshore sediments,"In this work, effects of microplastics (polypropylene and polystyrene) at four concentrations (0.2?????10%, w/w) on di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) degradation in offshore sediments were investigated. DBP degradation percentage was enhanced by 0.2% microplastics (7.3?????11.0% increment) but was reduced by 2?????10% microplastics (3.7?????27.7% decrement). Meanwhile, addition of microplastics with higher sorption ability to DBP led to lower DBP degradation percentage. The initial concentration of bioavailable DBP in sediments decreased with the increase of microplastic sorption ability to DBP and microplastic concentration. Microbial community structure was more significantly influenced by microplastic type than by microplastic concentration. Significant positive correlation was observed between the total relative abundances of dominant DBP-degraders and DBP degradation percentage. The results indicated that the changes in DBP degradation percentage were related to both DBP bioavailability and the total relative abundances of dominant DBP-degraders. Hence, persistence of the pollutant in the coastal environment was microplastic type- and concentration-dependent. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
8SKZPE29,"Preliminary screening for microplastic concentrations in the surface water of the ob and tom rivers in Siberia, Russia","To date, the largest Russian rivers discharging to the Arctic Ocean remain a ?????blank spot????? on the world map of data on the distribution of microplastics in freshwater systems. This study characterizes the abundance and morphology of microplastics in surface water of the Ob River and its large tributary, the Tom River, in western Siberia. The average number of particles for the two rivers ranged from 44.2 to 51.2 items per m3 or from 79.4 to 87.5 ??g per m3 in the Tom River and in the Ob River, respectively. Of the recovered microplastics, 93.5% were less than 1 mm in their largest dimension, the largest group (45.5% of total counts) consisted of particles with sizes range 0.30?????1.00 mm. Generally, microfragments of irregular shape were the most abundant among the Ob and Tom samples (47.4%) and exceeded microfibers (22.1%), microfilms (20.8%), and micro-spheres (9.74%) by average counts. Results from this study provide a baseline for understanding the scale of the transport of microplastics by the Ob River system into the Arctic Ocean and add to currently available data on microplastics abundance and diversity in freshwater systems of dif-fering global geographic locations. ?? 2020 by the authors.

UF3M4TVL,Microplastic fibres from synthetic textiles: Environmental degradation and additive chemical content,"Microplastic fibres (MPFs) often make up the largest fraction of microplastic pollution in aquatic environments, yet little is known about their degradative fate and persistence. This study investigates the environmentally relevant photodegradation of common MPFs: polyester (PET), polyamide (PA) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN), their respective additive chemical profile, together with their potential for additive leaching. MPFs were subject to ultraviolet (UV) exposure in seawater and freshwater media over 10 months. PET and PA MPFs showed significant fragmentation and surface changes following UV exposure, additionally PA showed evidence of chemical changes. PAN did not undergo significant photodegradation in the same exposure period. Chemicals tentatively identified in MPFs and aqueous leachates via non-target gas chromatography-mass spectrometry include monomers, UV stabilisers and degradation products. Characterisation of several bisphenols (BPs) and benzophenones (BzPs) was performed via ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Bisphenol A, bisphenol S and benzophenone-3 were quantified in all MPFs and wool at concentrations between 4.3 and 501 ng/g, with wool displaying the highest sum concentration of BPs and BzPs at 863 and 27 ng/g, respectively. Environmental parameters and material-specific properties influence the degradative fate of microplastic plastic fibres and their additive chemical leaching in aquatic environments. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",0
JDLRZ3F7,Comparative analysis of the behaviour of marine litter in thermochemical waste treatment processes,"Plastic in the ocean, especially plastic on the ocean surface is not only researched intensively but also photos and reports rise awareness of the challenge in the general public. While research is concerned with the fate of marine litter in the environment, recycling of these materials after collection is rarely addressed, mainly because there is neither considerable data on composition nor a suggested process to do so. This study is the first to analyse and evaluate chemical recycling (pyrolysis, gasification) and energy recovery (incineration) of marine litter. Two heterogenous marine litter samples from Sylt and Norderney, North Sea, Germany, were analysed, consisting of six different material groups. Agricultural mulch foil was used as reference material. The thermochemical treatment processes were reproduced by thermogravimetric analysis. Furthermore, pyrolysis trials on a semi-technical scale were conducted and the residues were analysed by proximate, ultimate and X-ray fluorescence analysis. The results indicate that heterogeneous and weathered material mixtures can be treated by thermochemical processes. Finally, the pyrolysis condensates are discussed as substrate for biotechnological upcycling. In summary, we present a comprehensive approach from the material characterisation of marine litter to the analysis of three different thermochemical treatment processes and the possibility to use the generated pyrolysis condensate for subsequent upcycling. The data collected form the basis for the evaluation and application of possible treatment options for the collected marine litter. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",0
9GPWCGFC,Effect of cadmium on the sorption of tylosin by polystyrene microplastics,"Microplastics are widespread in the environment and might transport readily by ocean currents, wind and atmospheric deposition. Simultaneously, antibiotics and heavy metals could often be detected in the environment. They are both positively charged, it is necessary to clarify the interactions of these pollutants with microplastics when they were coexist. In this study, the most commonly used polystyrene (PS) was selected as a representative microplastic. This study investigated the effect of Cd(II) on the sorption of TYL by PS in different coexistence systems. The results showed that: in the composite system, when TYL and Cd(II) coexist, the presence of Cd(II) could inhibit the sorption of TYL by PS, and the inhibitory effect increases with the increase of the concentration of Cd(II), indicating that competitive sorption dominates the sorption. When PS adsorbed Cd(II) first and then adsorbed TYL, the presence of Cd(II) was conducive to the sorption of TYL, and the sorption strengthened with the increase of Cd(II) concentration, indicating that the complexation between TYL and Cd(II) enhanced the sorption of TYL. In addition, initial pH values and ionic strength were essential in the sorption process. Therefore, this study could provide an important basis for evaluating the environmental behavior and ecological risk of microplastics in the process of compound pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",0
PU5T6P9L,Prokaryotic community succession and assembly on different types of microplastics in a mariculture cage,"This study provides new insights into the prokaryotic community succession and assembly on different microplastics in a nearshore mariculture cage by a three-month in situ incubation experiment. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Microplastics have emerged as a new anthropogenic substrate that can readily be colonized by microorganisms. Nevertheless, microbial community succession and assembly among different microplastics in nearshore mariculture cages remains poorly understood. Using an in situ incubation experiment, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the neutral model, we investigated the prokaryotic communities attached to polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP) in a mariculture cage in Xiangshan Harbor, China. The ??-diversities and compositions of microplastic-attached prokaryotic communities were significantly distinct from free-living and small particle-attached communities in the surrounding water but relatively similar to the large particle-attached communities. Although a distinct prokaryotic community was developed on each type of microplastic, the communities on PE and PP more closely resembled each other. Furthermore, the prokaryotic community dissimilarity among all media (microplastics and water fractions) tended to decrease over time. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria Alcanivorax preferentially colonized PE, and the genus Vibrio with opportunistically pathogenic members has the potential to colonize PET. Additionally, neutral processes dominated the prokaryotic community assembly on PE and PP, while selection was more responsible for the prokaryotic assembly on PET. The assembly of Planctomycetaceae and Thaumarchaeota Marine Group I taxa on three microplastics were mainly governed by selection and neutral processes, respectively. Our study provides further understanding of microplastic-associated microbial ecology in mariculture environments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0

24EWWZRQ,The potential of fluorescent dyes?????comparative study of Nile red and three derivatives for the detection of microplastics,"During the last years, microplastics in the environment came to the fore in environmental science research. For an appropriate risk assessment, it is essential to know the levels of microplastic contamination in the environment. In the field of microplastic detection, extensive research has been carried out in recent years. While common methods such as Raman spectroscopy and pyrolysis GC-MS are time-consuming and require trained staff and expensive equipment, there is the need for a cheap and easily applicable method. Staining microplastics with the fluorescent dye Nile red (NR) has a high potential to fulfill these criteria. In our work, we tested Nile red and newly developed derivatives, with the aim of achieving greater selectivity for plastic particles and more intense fluorescence. In addition, the influence of using different solvents and water at different pH values in the dyeing process was investigated by analyzing solid sample fluorescence spectra of dyed microplastics and natural particles. Finally, the method developed from the acquired knowledge was tested for sea salt. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] ?? 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",0
J2MKBNWY,Effect of environmentally relevant concentrations of potentially toxic microplastic on coastal copepods,"Tire wear particles (TWP) are both abundant and potentially toxic types of microplastic (MP) in the coastal ocean. We tested the effects of TWP type (new tires, old tires, rubber granules from artificial turfs) and concentration (10?????10,000 TWP L???1) on feeding, reproduction and fecal pellet production of two common coastal copepods at high (400 ??g C L???1) and low (40 ??g C L???1) food concentration consisting of a cryptophyte Rhodomonas sp. We did not observe any effect of TWP on copepods at environmentally relevant concentrations of &lt;10 TWP L???1. At TWP concentrations that were &gt;100 times higher than the MP concentrations measured in coastal waters, food concentration, copepod feeding mode, TWP concentration and TWP type interacted to influence copepod feeding and pellet production, while reproduction was unaffected. Our results suggest that TWP at the current measured concentrations in the ocean environment is not likely to be a threat to the common coastal copepods. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
UTAW3Z7G,Pre-detection of microplastics using active thermography,"Spectrometric analysis is one of the most widely used approaches to characterize the chemical nature of microplastics. Despite recent developments, this key step remains time consuming. The aim of this paper is to propose a new method for the pre-detection of microplastics based on mid-infrared imaging. Plastic particles were mixed with sand particles and placed on a glass filter. Infrared observation with a thermal camera shows a stronger thermal contrast measured between the filter and the plastics than between the filter and the sand, which reveals the plastic particles in a few tens of seconds. An image processing tool is then used to amplify this contrast. Furthermore, this pre-detection method makes it possible to propose hypotheses on the most probable chemical nature of the particles identified. Consequently, pre-detection using active thermography constitutes a promising way of significantly accelerating microplastic study. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
RPVV2RSA,Sponges as bioindicators for microparticulate pollutants?,"Amongst other threats, the world's oceans are faced with man-made pollution, including an increasing number of microparticulate pollutants. Sponges, aquatic filter-feeding animals, are able to incorporate fine foreign particles, and thus may be a potential bioindicator for microparticulate pollutants. To address this question, 15 coral reef demosponges sampled around Bangka Island (North Sulawesi, Indonesia) were analyzed for the nature of their foreign particle content using traditional histological methods, advanced light microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Sampled sponges accumulated and embedded the very fine sediment fraction (<200 ??m), absent in the surrounding sand, in the ectosome (outer epithelia) and spongin fibers (skeletal elements), which was confirmed by two-photon microscopy. A total of 34 different particle types were identified, of which degraded man-made products, i.e., polystyrene, particulate cotton, titanium dioxide and blue-pigmented particles, were incorporated by eight specimens at concentrations between 91 and 612 particle/g dry sponge tissue. As sponges can weigh several hundreds of grams, we conservatively extrapolate that sponges can incorporate on average 10,000 microparticulate pollutants in their tissue. The uptake of particles, however, appears independent of the material, which suggests that the fluctuation in material ratios is due to the spatial variation of surrounding microparticles. Therefore, particle-bearing sponges have a strong potential to biomonitor microparticulate pollutants, such as microplastics and other degraded industrial products. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
G48VQ4EV,Microplastics on the sea surface of the semi-closed Tokyo Bay,"Microplastics (MPs) pollution surveys were conducted in Tokyo Bay using neuston nets (May 2019 and January 2020). Although the pollution level in Tokyo Bay was high (3.98 pcs/m3, May), it was lower than reported in other semi-closed bays because of differences in the Enclosed Index. It was found that polyethylene fragments dominated the retrieved MPs; the mode of MPs size was 800 ??m. As MPs abundance in rivers had the same seasonality as found in the inner bay, rivers were considered the main source of MPs. The seawater residence time is shorter than the time required for the density of MPs to become greater than that of seawater; therefore, it was considered that MPs are transported out of the bay instead of sinking. MPs were aggregated into a convergence zone by residual currents (the thermohaline front) in May (January). These findings will improve understanding of MPs pollution in other bays. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
ML3688CS,"Impacts of microplastic fibres on the marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovinciallis","Tumble dryer lint has been employed as a surrogate for synthetic and processed (microplastic) fibres discharged to the environment from laundering activities and exposed to marine mussels (Mytilus galloprovinciallis) in controlled experiments for a period of 7 d. A range of biological responses at different levels of organisation were subsequently determined, with copper employed concurrently as a positive control. Physiological changes were assessed from measurements of clearance rate, histopathological effects were evaluated from abnormalities in (or injuries to) gill and digestive gland tissues, and genetic damage was determined by measuring DNA strand breaks using the comet assay. With increasing lint concentration (over the range 56?????180 mg L???1) we observed a reduction in mean clearance rate, increasing extents of abnormality in both gills (e.g. deciliation and hypertrophy) and digestive gland (e.g. atrophy and necrosis), and an increase in damage to DNA. The precise causes of these effects are unclear but likely arise from both the fibrous material itself and from chemicals (e.g. additives and metals) that are mobilised from the polymers into seawater or the digestive tract. The latter assertion is consistent with an observed increase in the release of certain trace elements (e.g. zinc) into the exposure medium with increasing lint concentration. Although microfibre concentrations we employed are significantly greater than those typically encountered in the environment, the results indicate the potential for this type of material to exert a range of adverse effects on exposed marine animals. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
RGZSRQMH,NetPlus: Achieving a net positive impact plastic,"Once seen as a miracle material, petroleum-based plastics are now arguably one of the largest sources of pollution on the planet. With 80% of land-based litter ending up in our oceans, ocean plastic is now reported to be on track to outweigh fish by 2050. Conservationists have been able to identify the most harmful form of ocean plastic pollution for marine mammals, turtles, and seabirds worldwide to be discarded fishing gear. Bureo, a company operating between Chile and California in partnership with sustainable outdoor retailer Patagonia, is addressing this issue by transforming this harmful material into high-value products. Through their shared-value business model and life cycle thinking, they have built a network of partnering fishing communities across the coast of Chile committed to return their fishing nets at their end of life in exchange for compensation towards community programs. Through their innovative supply chain and the living product challenge framework, Bureo is setting out to achieve the first plastic with a net positive impact on the environment and people.

5L47MRSU,Vibrio colonization is highly dynamic in early microplastic-associated biofilms as well as on field-collected microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems and provide a habitat for biofilm-forming bacteria. The genus Vibrio, which includes potential pathogens, was detected irregularly on microplastics. Since then, the potential of microplastics to enrich (and serve as a vector for) Vibrio has been widely discussed. We investigated Vibrio abundance and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) composition on polyethylene and polystyrene within the first 10 h of colonization during an in situ incubation experiment, along with those found on particles collected from the Baltic Sea. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and co-occurrence networks to elaborate the role of Vibrio within biofilms. Colonization of plastics with Vibrio was detectable after one hour of incubation; however, Vibrio numbers and composition were very dynamic, with a more stable population at the site with highest nutrients and lowest salinity. Likewise, Vibrio abundances on field-collected particles were variable but correlated with proximity to major cities. Vibrio was poorly connected within biofilm networks. Taken together, this indicates that Vibrio is an early colonizer of plastics, but that the process is undirected and independent of the specific surface. Still, higher nutrients could enhance a faster establishment of Vibrio populations. These parameters should be considered when planning studies investigating Vibrio on microplastics. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",0
NZUQVUDH,Microplastics and their associated organic pollutants from the coastal waters of the central Adriatic Sea (Italy): Investigation of adipogenic effects in vitro,"Even though microplastic (MP) pollution in aquatic environment is nowadays widely studied, a huge gap of knowledge exists on their actual biological effects. In this study we first reported environmental baseline data on the occurrence and characterization of ???oating MPs in Italian coastal waters of the Central Adriatic Sea by using a standardized monitoring protocol. Further, we analyzed the concentrations of MP-associated chemicals and evaluated their potential adipogenic effects using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. MPs were found in each sampling stations showing the highest abundance (1.88 ?? 1.78 items/m3) in the sites more distant from the coast with fragments as the most common shape category. All targeted organic pollutants (i.e. polychlorinated biphenyls - PCBs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -PAHs, organophosphorus - OP, and organochlorine - OC pesticides) have been detected on the surface of the collected MPs. The highest concentrations of PAHs were found on MPs from inshore (i.e. &lt;1.5 NM) surface waters with low-ring PAHs as dominant components. Similarly, MPs from inshore waters had higher ??PCB concentrations (64.72 ng/g plastic) than those found in offshore (i.e. &gt;6 NM) waters (10.37 ng/g plastic). Among pesticides, all measured OPs were detected in each sample analyzed with pirimiphos-methyl as the most representative compound. For OCs, the sum of all concentrations of congeners was higher in coastal with respect to offshore waters. Moreover, in vitro 3T3-L1 screening of MP extracts indicated potential metabolic effects resulting in both adipogenesis and lipid uptake/storage. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
P8RLY39F,Composition and abundance of macrolitter along the Italian coastline: The first baseline assessment within the european Marine Strategy Framework Directive,"Main findings: The first baseline for beach litter density (2015?????2018) was established for Italy in the framework of the MSFD. Litter quantity and composition was found to differ significantly among subregions, indicating the need for targeted measures to reduce litter inputs in the marine environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd The main objective of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) was to achieve a Good Environmental Status (GES) in European waters by 2020, according to 11 descriptors. Descriptor 10 is related to marine litter and envisages that the properties and quantities of marine litter are at a level that does not cause harm to the coastal and marine environment. Even if GES was not achieved by 2020, the first MSFD implementation cycle filled many gaps in knowledge. Here we present the first data (2015?????2018) on beach litter densities along Italian coasts and discuss lessons learnt and future perspectives. The beach litter median density was 477 items/100 m (interquartile range: 261?????934 items/100 m), but subregional differences emerged both in terms of litter quantities and composition. The Adriatic Sea was the most polluted subregion (590 items/100 m), followed by the Western Mediterranean Sea (491 items/100 m) and the Ionian Sea and Central Mediterranean Sea subregion (274 items/100 m). A high presence of aquaculture-related litter (mainly mussel nets) characterised beaches in the Adriatic Sea. At the same time, the numbers of cotton bud sticks were extremely high in some beaches of the Western Mediterranean Sea. General litter (items discarded or left by the public on the coast or inland and carried by winds and rivers or objects originating from tourism and recreation at land or sea, poor waste management practices, etc.) was the most common litter typology (38.8%). The results of this study represent the first baseline to compare achievement towards GES in the next years and the efficacy of the program of measures which entered into force in 2016, concerning beach litter densities and composition. They also highlight the necessity of a joint effort for deploying harmonised marine litter monitoring methodologies across the European Member States to obtain comparable results. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
LA9LDULN,Fate of lost fishing gears: Experimental evidence of biofouling colonization patterns from the northwestern Mediterranean Sea,"ALDFGs (abandoned, lost or otherwise discharged fishing gears) represent a major pollutant in the world's oceans, including the Mediterranean Sea, but very little is known about their long-term fate in the underwater environment. Here we investigate the destiny of ALDFGs in a coralligenous benthic community by studying the biofouling growing on them at 30 m depth over a three-year period. Results indicate that ALDFGs are quickly covered by biofouling, reaching maximum values of cover in one year. At this depth, the biofouling community results highly influenced by light-dependent seasonal cycles and a general four-steps colonization scheme is tentatively depicted: i) biofouling community is initially dominated by fast-growing organisms, with algae and hydrozoans settling after two weeks; ii) small-sized carbonatic organisms (e.g. bryozoans) appear after two months; iii) the same organisms (including coralline algae) become abundant after five to eight months; iv) conspicuous carbonatic skeletons (serpulids, bivalves and bryozoans) occur after one year increasing in complexity in the following months. The biofouling settled on ALDFGs, as well as growth rates of large carbonatic species, could provide useful information to estimate the age of lost lines and nets in retrieved material and in situ photo footage complementing the overview of the fishing impact in this specific environment. Finally, no signs of nylon degradation are reported, suggesting that the prevailing physical conditions and the biofouling cover extent could alter microplastics release from nylon ALDFGs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd biofouling colonization patterns and growth rates are used to evaluate the fate of abandoned, lost or otherwise discharged fishing gears. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
BZBKJGJH,Polymer types ingested by northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) and southern hemisphere relatives,"Although ingestion of plastic by tubenosed seabirds has been documented regularly, identification of the polymer composition of these plastics has rarely been described. Polymer assessment may assist in identifying sources and may indicate risks from additives occurring in specific types of polymers. Using known test materials, two identification methods Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and near infrared spectroscopy (FTIR and NIR) were compared. Although both methods were found to be similarly suitable for identification of plastic polymers, a significant difference was observed in identification of natural materials. FTIR frequently misclassified natural materials as being a synthetic polymer. Within our results, an 80% match score threshold functioned best to distinguish between natural items and synthetics. Using NIR, the historical variability of plastics ingested by northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) from the Dutch sector of the North Sea was analysed for three time periods since the 1980s. For the more recent decade, variability between fulmars from different regions in the northeast Atlantic was investigated. Regional variation was further explored by analysing plastics obtained from the stomachs of southern hemisphere relatives of the fulmar (southern fulmar, cape petrel, snow petrel) and Wilson?????s storm petrel. Results show that proportional abundance of polymer types in these seabirds is closely related to the plastic categories that they ingest (e.g. pellets, foam, fragments). The uptake of different plastic categories and related polymer types most likely reflects spatial and temporal variations in availability rather than ingestion preferences of the birds. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",0
KCV3UMD8,Characterization and spatial distribution of microplastics in two wild captured economic freshwater fish from north and west rivers of Guangdong province,"As a new type of pollutant, microplastics are of emerging widespread concern, while amount of research done in freshwater environments and organisms is litter compared to that in marine. Following this reality, the categories of MPs in two economic freshwater fish at 25 sites from 11 cities in the north and west rivers of Guangdong province were documented. Here, 76 individuals belong Oreochromis niloticus and Cirrhinus molitorella were investigated and microplastics were found in the GITs of 43.4% and gills of 25%. The average abundances of microplastics have significant difference between Oreochromis niloticus (0.015 items/ g) and Cirrhinus molitorella (0.031 items/g), while no difference by individual ( 1.9 items). The plastics were dominated by white in color (61%), fragment in shape (67%), and lass than 1 mm in size (74%). The spatial distribution of microplastics revealed that there are significant differences between different cities in average abundances, and the highest average abundances of MPs were found in Zhanjiang city (4.25 items/individual) and Guangzhou city (0.044 items/g), respectively. Our results fully proved that the microplastics was widely ingested by wild fish species and suggested that the abundance and distribution of microplastics are positively related with the development of economy, tourism, industry, agriculture, and fishery. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
DL4YDHLU,First evaluation of microplastics in two commercial fish species from the lagoons of Bizerte and Ghar El Melh (Northern Tunisia),"Microplastic contamination was investigated, for the first time, in the gastrointestinal tract of two commercial fish species Sarpa salpa and Liza aurata from the lagoons of Bizerte and Ghar El Melh, during February 2019. Microplastics, ranging from 0.2 to 5 mm, were found in the two investigated fish species with high levels in fishes from the lagoon of Bizerte (65.33 ?? 6.50 and 66.40 ?? 5.12 items individual???1 in L. aurata and S. salpa, respectively). In the lagoon of Ghar El Melh, microplastic ingestion showed statistically significant variability between the two species (42.00 ?? 6.08 items individual???1 in S. sapla and 22.40 ?? 3.97 items individual???1in L. aurata). Isolated microplastics appeared in a variety of coloured types, such as fibres&gt; fragments&gt; films and were identified as Polypropylene and Polyethylene polymers by FTIR-ATR analysis. The obtained results indicate the growing threat that affects the two sampling sites and suggest the inclusion of the studied fish species on the list of marine plastic ingestion bioindicators. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
Q7W8Q2K4,Volunteer beach cleanups: civic environmental stewardship combating global plastic pollution,"Marine litter, the majority of which is plastic, is one of the most pressing global environmental challenges impacting the planet. One way coastal communities respond to this challenge is through the environmental stewardship practice of volunteer beach cleanups. Beyond providing temporarily cleaner local beaches, how might these beach cleanups have broader impacts in the global struggle against plastic pollution? Using the lenses of environmental stewardship and civic ecology, we conducted a content analysis of primary source materials created by 50 groups involved in volunteer beach cleanups. We collected data on the scale at which groups coordinate volunteer beach cleanups, the roles they play in conducting these cleanups, how they interact with other volunteer beach cleanup groups, and the other forms of stewardship they conduct, if any. Within our sample, we identified groups coordinating volunteer beach cleanups at five geographic scales: local, sub-national, national, multi-national, and global. Within the groups operating at each scale, we found groups conducting environmental stewardship in the forms of education, advocacy, research, and monitoring in addition to their conservation work through beach cleanups. Our findings demonstrate that groups branch out their impacts by combining different forms of environmental stewardship targeting plastic pollution, and they collaborate to scale up their actions in ways that contribute to plastic pollution governance. Connecting these findings with the literature on the broader impacts of civic ecology practices allows us to theorize how volunteer beach cleanup groups branch out and scale up their efforts to weave a global net of ocean stewardship. ?? 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",0
H9LYIGJJ,Historical anecdotes of fishing pressure: Misconstrued ?????sea serpent????? sightings provide evidence for antecedent entanglement of marine biota in the British Isles,"Marine scholars have come to realize the importance of including historical perspectives as part of comprehensive assessments made of the social?????ecological systems involved in sustainable fisheries management.

LAWHCUJQ,"Characteristics of expanded polystyrene microplastics on island beaches in the Pearl River Estuary: abundance, size, surface texture and their metals-carrying capacity","While expanded polystyrene (EPS) microplastics have been widely recognized as one of the most important components of plastic litter in the intertidal zones of the global ocean, our understanding of their environmental fate on island beaches is insufficient. In this study, we intended to reveal that the latest EPS microplastic pollution status on 5 island beaches in the Pearl River Estuary, China, by comprehensively assessing the abundance, distribution, size, surface texture and carrying capacity of heavy metals (Cd, As, Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb, Mn, Fe, Al). High level of EPS microplastic abundance ranged from 328 to 82,276 particles m???2 was found, with the highest abundance at Guishan Island and the lowest at Dong?????ao Island. Spatial distribution of EPS microplastic abundance was significantly different among different islands. EPS microplastics in the size range of 1?????2 mm were the most abundant. The content of heavy metals in EPS microplastics collected on the beaches was greater than that in the new EPS products. The average concentrations of heavy metals in EPS microplastics from 5 islands are Cd (0.27 ?? 0.19 ??g g???1), As (5.50 ?? 3.84 ??g g???1), Cr (14.9 ?? 8.25 ??g g???1), Cu (15.0 ?? 7.66 ??g g???1), Ni (17.2 ?? 17.6 ??g g???1), Pb (24.8 ?? 7.39 ??g g???1), Mn (730 ?? 797 ??g g???1), Fe (8340 ?? 4760 ??g g???1), and Al (9624 ?? 6187 ??g g???1), respectively. The correlation between heavy metals in EPS microplastics and sediments was better than that between heavy metals in EPS microplastics and seawater. The study results indicated that EPS microplastics could act as a carrier for the transport of heavy metals, which might pose a threat to biological and human health. ?? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",1
96D5WM4H,Biofilms of Pseudomonas and Lysinibacillus Marine Strains on High-Density Polyethylene,"Environmental pollution by plastic debris is estimated on a scale of 100 million metric tons, a portion of which is fragmented into micro- and nanoplastics. These fragments are often colonized by bacterial species in marine environments, possibly contributing to the biodegradation of such materials. However, further investigations are necessary to determine the impact of abiotic polymer weathering on biofilm adhesion, as well as the specific biofilm formation strategies employed by marine isolates. Here, we evaluate deep-sea sediment bacterial isolates for biofilm adhesion, extracellular matrix production, and polymer degradation ability. Our study focuses on high-density polyethylene (HDPE) fragments for their high durability and environmental persistence, subjecting fragments to abiotic weathering prior to bacterial colonization. Marine isolates identified as Pseudomonas sp. and Lysinibacillus sp. exhibited decreasing biofilm formation on weathered HDPE, especially over the first 24 h of incubation. This effect was countered by increased extracellular matrix production, likely improving cell adhesion to surfaces roughened by abiotic degradation. These adhesion strategies were contrasted with a reference Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, which displayed high levels of biofilm formation on non-weathered HDPE and lower extracellular matrix production over the first 24 h of incubation. Furthermore, our results suggest that an increase in biofilm biomass correlated with changes to HDPE structure, indicating that these strains have a potential for biodegradation of plastic fragments. Therefore, this work provides a detailed account of biofilm formation strategies and bacteria-plastic interactions that represent crucial steps in the biodegradation of plastic fragments in marine environments. ?? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",0
HLEVWEX3,A novel poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)-degrading actinobacterium that was isolated from plastisphere formed on marine plastic debris,"Plastic debris surfaces in marine environments provide novel habitats for marine microbes. This type of microbial community is known as a ?????plastisphere?????. Prior metagenomic analyses of plastispheres suggest that the surface of marine plastic debris contain plastic-degrading microbes. Here, we focus on plastisphere as a microbial source. We isolated strain OK12 from plastic bag debris collected from a beach in Japan. The strain grew on a mineral medium supplemented with poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] as the sole carbon source. Genetic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the strain belongs to the genus Nocardioides. In addition, the average nucleotide identity value of the two genomes of the strain OK12 and Nocardioides marinisabuli DSM 18965, a marine species, was 98.3 %, above the 95 % threshold. The strain did not grow above 50 ??C, and the optimum temperature for growth was 30 ??C. The strain grew and degraded P(3HB) in a broad range of NaCl concentrations (0.01?????2.4 M), whereas it did not grow without NaCl, suggesting that the strain is a marine species. The strain degraded the P(3HB) film at a fast rate, despite the fact that the P(3HB) degrading activity in the culture supernatant was low. The strain formed biofilms on the P(3HB) and polypropylene film surfaces. This biofilm formation may have helped the strain to degrade P(3HB). ?? 2020",0
4598HKWG,Polystyrene foam as a source and sink of chemicals in the marine environment: An XRF study,"Polystyrene foam (expanded and extruded polystyrene: EPS and XPS, respectively) is a ubiquitous and pervasive type of marine plastic whose physical properties, transport and fate are distinctly different to those of other common (unfoamed) types of thermoplastic litter. In this study, a range of fragments of EPS and XPS retrieved from three beaches in southwest England have been characterised by energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry in order to examine the chemical makeup and potential biological and geochemical impacts and interactions of this type of plastic waste. Analyses performed through sample faces and, in some cases and after dissection, through the material core, revealed variable concentrations of Fe, Ti and Zn among the fragments and, in many instances, within the same sample. This likely reflects the presence of reaction residues and pigments arising from the manufacture of polystyrene, and, for Fe and Ti, significant and heterogeneous ion and mineral acquisition from the environment during transport in suspension or while beached. Acquired oxides of Fe are partly responsible for the chemical fouling observed on the face of most samples and are able to act as an adsorbent for other metals, like Pb. Detection of Br in many fragments up to concentrations of 11,500 mg kg???1 likely results from the incorporation of the flame retardant, hexabromocyclododecane, in EPS and XPS designed for (but not necessarily limited to) the construction sector. These observations suggest that EPS and XPS can act as both a source and sink for contaminants in the marine environment that merit further investigation. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
624X9N6D,Using citizen science to evaluate extended producer responsibility policy to reduce marine plastic debris shows no reduction in pollution levels,"As governments around the world grapple with the challenge of responding to increased plastic pollution, extended producer responsibility (EPR) policy, which shifts the responsibility for waste management of a product to producers, is quickly becoming a cornerstone of legislative approaches to this issue. However, the effectiveness of this policy has never been assessed in terms of reducing plastic marine debris. Understanding if a policy like EPR is having an effect requires collecting and analyzing information before and after a policy is introduced. Using British Columbia, Canada as a case study, we evaluate the influence of an EPR policy for packaging to reduce shoreline pollution. We use available citizen science data to demonstrate that there has been no reduction in pollution levels after the introduction of the policy. The findings also highlight some limitations when using citizen science data for a purpose it was not intended for. To effectively evaluate prevention of plastic pollution in the marine environment, plastic policy interventions require monitoring programs tailored to their specific requirements. ?? 2020",0
WLCRCRCM,Environmental impacts of glass-and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer bar-reinforced seawater and sea sand concrete beams used in marine environments: An lca case study,"Application of glass-or carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP/CFRP) bars makes the direct use of seawater and sea sand concrete (SWSSC) in construction feasible, which is of high interest in order to conserve the limited resources of fresh water and river sand. The present paper performed the life cycle assessment (LCA) of constructing three kinds of beams (GFRP/CFRP bar-reinforced SWSSC beams, and steel bar-reinforced common concrete (SRC) beam) in marine environments to show the environmental benefits of using FRP bar-reinforced SWSSC beams in marine environments. According to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, stages including production, transportation, construction, use and end-of-life are within the LCA?????s boundary. The ReCiPe method and eight main environmental impact categories were used to characterize the environmental impacts of those beams. LCA results indicate that one cubic meter SWSSC possesses much lower environmental impacts in terms of all eight categories compared with common concrete with the same volume when used in marine environments, with reduction rates from 26.3% to 48.6%. When the two transportation distances were set as 50 and 20 km and without considering the difference in service life, compared to SRC beam, GFRP-SWSSC beam performs better in six categories and CFRP-SWSSC beam performs better in four categories. When considering increased transportation distance and the higher durability performance, the advantageous categories for GFRP-SWSSC and CFRP-SWSSC beams increase to seven and six, respectively. The environmental impacts of all the three beams are mainly affected by the production stages. ?? 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",0
NVFX6DMG,Durability of BFRP bars wrapped in seawater sea sand concrete,"To investigate the durability of structures containing basalt fibre-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars wrapped in seawater sea sand concrete (SWSSC) in marine environments, three sizes (including bare BFRP bars) of SWSSC-wrapped BFRP bars were subjected to laboratory accelerated corrosion tests in simulated seawater environments. The SWSSC thicknesses were set at 10 mm and 20 mm; the immersion temperatures were room temperature ( 28 ??C), 40 ??C, and 60 ??C; and the immersion media included a seawater, tap-water, and alkaline solution. The tensile properties of the SWSSC-wrapped BFRP bars after immersion were determined, and the degradation mechanism of the BFRP bars was investigated. Based on the results, the alkaline solution is more damaging to the BFRP bars than tap-water or seawater. Alkalinity is a key factor causing the degradation of the BFRP bars. Thus, the tensile strength retention of BFRP bars wrapped with thicker SWSSC, which has a higher alkalinity environment, could be lower than that of bare BFRP bars. In addition, prediction of the tensile strength retention of the SWSSC-wrapped BFRP bars based on Arrhenius relationship was conducted, and the prediction resutls agree well with the experimental results. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0

8PS2XQXP,Modelling pure polyamide 6 hydrolysis: Influence of water content in the amorphous phase,"An extensive experimental study of pure hydrolysis (without oxygen) in polyamide 6 is presented in this paper. 250 micron thick film samples were immersed in pure deoxygenated water at 5 ageing temperatures for almost 2 years. Hydrolysis leads to chain scission, an increase in crystallinity and more surprisingly in a large rise in water content. A new kinetic model considering this water content increase is proposed. The modelled data are confronted with experimental values. It is mandatory to consider this increase in water content in order to be able to predict chain scission at a high level of degradation. It appears that in the absence of oxygen, hydrolysis in polyamide 6 is a slow process when the pH is neutral (7 pH) and obeys an Arrhenius law with an activation energy of 106 kJ/mol. This new model can be used to predict the leaching of macromolecules from the polymer to external water that is of great interest in the framework of ocean pollution by microplastics. ?? 2020",0
QG2Z2XL6,"Suspended fine particulate matter (PM2.5), microplastics (MPs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in air: Their possible relationships and health implications","Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and their associated microcontaminants have been linked to increased harmful effects on the human health. In this study, the possible relationships between PM2.5, microplastics (MPs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed in an urban area of Bushehr port, in the northern part of the Persian Gulf. Presence, sources, and health risks of MPs and PAHs in both normal and dusty days were also investigated. The median of PM2.5 and ??PAHs were 52.8 ??g/m3 and 14.1 ng/m3, respectively, indicating high pollution levels especially in dusty days. The mean level of MPs in urban suspended PM2.5 was 5.2 items/m3. Fragments were the most abundant shape of identified MPs and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was the most plastic types in urban dust of Bushehr port. The results revealed that PM2.5 and MPs may possibly act as a carrier for airborne MPs and PAHs, respectively. In addition, the significant positive relationships between MPs, wind speed and wind direction, confirmed that the MPs transportation were highly controlled by atmospheric condition. Moreover, the source identification methods and trajectory analyses indicated that petrogenic sources from both proximal and distal origins play an important role in the level of PAHs. The results of chronic health risk evaluation via inhalation revealed that PM2.5-bound PAHs had high potential cancer risk in winter, while, the estimated risks for non-carcinogenic PAHs were not considerable. In the case of MPs, the assessment of human intake of MPs via inhalation highlighted the possible risks for habitants. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",0
4GE99K8Z,"Anthropogenic Marine Debris (AMD) in Mangrove Forests of Pujada Bay, Davao Oriental, Philippines","Anthropogenic marine debris (AMD) is a global threat to marine biodiversity and marine ecosystems. The main objectives of this study were to compare and characterize the AMD composition of mangrove stands that are located in a reserve area and mangrove stands that are influenced by nearby human settlement. Two study areas were chosen based on similar mangrove species composition and stand where transect quadrats (50 x 50m) were established in the area. The AMD were sampled during low tide in six subplots (5 x 5m) located in the transect quadrats in the mangrove forest of Dahican and Matiao, in Pujada bay, Davao Oriental. Various types of AMD were collected, cleaned and dried and then weighted and classified as belonging to plastics, cloths, rubber, glass, metals, wood or other items. Comparison of weight of AMD between the two study areas (Dahican and Matiao) showed no significant differences (P=0.119). In terms of comparison of different categories in the two study areas, only Matiao showed significant differences (P<0.001) with the category of cloth contributing highly at 39 g. There was no significant difference of the categories for the study area in Dahican (P=0.137). Further confirmatory studies on AMD and mangroves and its ability to trap AMDs are suggested including the impacts of AMD on marine fauna and flora. ?? 2020 Institution for Marine and Island Cultures, Mokpo National University.",0
KDYAZ5FC,AFM observation of sea-island structure formed by second generation acrylic adhesive,"Although adhesive-adherend interfaces play an important role in improving adhesive joint strength, their observation is a challenging task. If the adhesive and adherend can be clearly separated, the interface can be observed directly. Because this was fortunately achieved with the combination of a second-generation acrylic adhesive and several plastics, the differences in the formation of sea-island structures at interfaces was verified as related to adhesive strength. Phase mapping, stiffness measurements, and thermal analysis were conducted with atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the physical properties of the sea-island structures. The internal adhesive structure observed by AFM was in good agreement with the transmission electron microscopy analyses. The structure of the adhesive-adherend interface that showed a good bonding strength was similar to the internal structure, forming a large acrylic-rich island and rubber-rich sea. In the case of plastics with low surface energies, however, the interface formed a distinctive structure with small acrylic islands in a rubber sea. The difference in the formation of the sea-island structure is considered to be related to the wettability of the adhesive to the adherends, and it was revealed that a stronger interface corresponds to a structure more closely resembling that of the inside. ?? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0
FFWX7G78,Methods Matter: Methods for Sampling Microplastic and Other Anthropogenic Particles and Their Implications for Monitoring and Ecological Risk Assessment,"To inform mitigation strategies and understand how microplastics affect wildlife, research is focused on understanding the sources, pathways, and occurrence of microplastics in the environment and in wildlife. Microplastics research entails counting and characterizing microplastics in nature, which is a labor-intensive process, particularly given the range of particle sizes and morphologies present within this diverse class of contaminants. Thus, it is crucial to determine appropriate sampling methods that best capture the types and quantities of microplastics relevant to inform the questions and objectives at hand. It is also critical to follow protocols with strict quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) measures so that results reflect accurate estimates of microplastic contamination. Here, we assess different sampling procedures and QA/QC strategies to inform best practices for future environmental monitoring and assessments of exposure. We compare microplastic abundance and characteristics in surface-water samples collected using different methods (i.e., manta and bulk water) at the same sites, as well as duplicate samples for each method taken at the same site and approximate time. Samples were collected from 9 sampling sites within San Francisco Bay, California, USA, using 3 different sampling methods: 1) manta trawl (manta), 2) 1-L grab (grab), and 3) 10-L bulk water filtered in situ (pump). Bulk water sampling methods (both grab and pump) captured more microplastics within the smaller size range (<335 ??m), most of which were fibers. Manta samples captured a greater diversity of morphologies but underestimated smaller-sized particles. Inspection of pump samples revealed high numbers of particles from procedural contamination, stressing the need for robust QA/QC, including sampling and analyzing laboratory blanks, field blanks, and duplicates. Choosing the appropriate sampling method, combined with rigorous, standardized QA/QC practices, is essential for the future of microplastics research in marine and freshwater ecosystems.

X7VMP2UF,"Mechanical and flammability properties of a polyamide 6,6 nanocomposite for nonstructural marine engine components","The actual replacement of traditional metallic components with plastic-based materials in the marine sector is currently extremely limited, mainly due to mechanical requirements and flammability issues. In this work, a fiberglass-reinforced polyamide 6,6 matrix, loaded with innovative flame retardants based on nanosized organoclays has been evaluated as a replacement for aluminum in a marine engine cover. Experimental data were acquired to assess the mechanical performances and flammability properties of this novel polymer nanocomposite in comparison with those of a commercial sample based on the same polymeric matrix loaded with traditional flame retardants. The results showed that then use of nanoclays in place of standard flame retardants increased the mechanical properties of the polymer nanocomposite at all tested temperatures (22% of modulus increase at 20 ??C, 93% at 110 ??C), concomitantly meeting the minimum nonflammability requirements (self-extinguishing, without dropping of flammable material). ?? 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.",0
YYC57C5S,"Factors influencing the vertical distribution of microplastics in the beach sediments around the Ras Rakan Island, Qatar","Microplastic (MP) pollution is an emerging environmental problem, particularly in the marine environment, and nations are concerned about this issue. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the vertical distribution of MPs present in the beach sediments around the Ras Rakan Island of Qatar. Sampling was conducted at 9 locations, vertically to a depth of 30 cm with an interval of 5 cm. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to chemically identify the subsets of MPs as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polystyrene (EPS). The counts of MPs were found to be higher in the western and northern parts of the island. The vertical distribution of MPs ranged from 0 to 665 particles/kilogram with maximum abundance at the surface layer (0?????5 cm). Pellets were the dominant type of MPs in the surface sediments, whereas fibers were dominant in the bottom sediments. The prevailing winds, waves, tides, and currents are the forces responsible for the distribution and transport of MPs from offshore to the island and further to vertical re-distribution as time progresses. The level of MP pollution along the coast of Ras Rakan Island was higher than that found on the coast of mainland Qatar. Thus, informing that remote islands should also be considered for MP pollution monitoring programs to assess the risk associated with MP on the biota. ?? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",1
6VDI4JCD,Global plastic waste management strategies (Technical and behavioral) during and after COVID-19 pandemic for cleaner global urban life,"COVID-19 pandemic has affected the fabric of the world: health system, travel, living and working styles, and economy. Furthermore, it has also severely impacted the previously on-going global efforts to reduce the use of plastic waste. During the period of the whole COVID-19, the sustainable measures and products adopted for the conservation of our land and marine ecosystem are being neglected or at the very least, kept on hold. The use of plastic-based personal protective equipment (PPEs) and sanitizers by health-care professionals and the public has led to a huge surge in a plastic waste generation without any plans to mitigate its severity. It is vital to understand the impact of this problem and find the possible solutions. The sudden escalation in medical plastic waste makes it difficult to follow the protocol of medical plastic waste handling in the civic waste management system. In this article all plastic waste management issues faced globally, especially in the developing world, have been highlighted. Moreover, in the end, some possible solutions have been recommended for the safe handling of plastic wastes in the civic society such as plastic waste management system, the use of artificial intelligence from generation to disposal, etc. In addition, the steps to produce a zero waste society have been recommended. This study emphasizes not only government institutes and technological centers but also on the common citizens to make a sustainable civic society. ?? 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0
NRVMKQP4,Paper vs leaf: Carbon footprint of single-use plates made from renewable materials,"Plastic pollution of the natural environment world-wide is ubiquitous. More than 80% of marine litter is made of plastics, 70% of which originates from disposable items, so plastic disposables need to be replaced with disposables made from renewable materials. However, it is important to investigate the environmental impact of renewable alternatives through their life cycle, in order to support sustainable consumption and production. In this study, the carbon footprint of disposable plates made from two different renewable materials (paper, tree leaves) were analysed using life cycle assessment. The leaf plate was produced in India and the paper plate in Finland, but both were used and disposed of in Sweden. The results showed that the leaf plate had higher carbon footprint, due to long-distance transport and use of fossil fuel-based electricity for production. Scenario analysis indicated that the emissions associated with the leaf plate were lower when replacing air freight with sea transport and with economies of scale in expanded production. For the paper plate, the processing stage was shown to contribute most life cycle emissions. These could be lowered by applying a biodegradable coating. In comparison the leaf plate had the benefit of being biodegradable, but this benefit was not enough to compete with the paper plate which was consider the less environmentally damaging alternative. However, in order to increase sustainability in the food supply chain, it will not be enough to just improve the material use for single use plates, especially since the idea of single use materials could be seen as less sustainable, but improved materials have the potential to offset the anticipated growth of the food service sector where single use items are widely used. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
NSFP8B7H,Characterization of degradation behavior of poly(glycerol maleate) films in various aqueous environments,"Plastic pollution has become a serious environmental challenge, especially in the past two decades due to the ubiquitous use of plastics all over the world. To reduce plastic pollution, biodegradable polymers are in high demand as alternatives for common plastics. In this work, we study the degradability of poly(glycerol maleate)(PGM) in various aqueous environments to evaluate the influence of salinity and microorganisms on the degradation. PGM films are immersed in reverse osmosis (R.O.) water, fresh water, tap water, artificial seawater and seawater at 25 ??C for 56 days. The mechanism of the degradation is discussed through mass remaining (%), water uptake (%), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and surface morphology via scanning electron microscope (SEM). It is revealed that PGM degrades efficiently in seawater and freshwater environments. Furthermore, with the presence of microorganisms, the degradation of PGM in seawater is slightly retarded, with over 95% of PGM films degraded within 56 days. Overall, PGM shows great potential as a biodegradable polymer that degrades rapidly in aqueous environments, regardless of the presences of microorganisms. ?? 2020",0

It considered the mechanisms of catastrophic processes and their influence on fine nanostructured deep-sea pelitic sediments mixed with coarse carbonate-iron-aluminosilicate sandy rocks (turbidities). It discussed the conditions of oozy marine turbiditic-pelitic compositions transportation in coastal shelf zones with up to 200 m depth, on underwater continental slopes at 200?????2000 m depth; their behavior at 2?????8 km depth and interaction in deep-water (8?????10 km) intercontinental trenches and chasms with magmatic half-melted iron-aluminosilicate materials. For the first time, it was considered and described according to the laws of colloid nanoscience, the mechanisms of complex processes of formation, transporting, flowing, and coagulation?????condensation nanostructurization and compacting of iron-aluminosilicate compositions with saving of developed nano- and micropore state. It shows the important role of wind influences and induced by them above-water turbulent and underwater laminar (thermophilic) waves on the creeping of iron-aluminosilicate sediments for the catastrophic phenomena. It indicates the important role and influence on such phenomena of the hyperanomaly and ultraanomaly viscous effects in iron-aluminosilicate dispersions while their transition from elastic into plastic state. And the appropriate models of the mentioned phenomena and their concurrent rheological processes were presented. ?? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",0
7BZZVIK7,A polyvinylpyrrolidone-based surface-active copolymer for an effective marine antifouling coating,"Currently, it is highly desirable to develop a stable and effective antifouling coating in maritime industries. In this work, a novel surface-active copolymer basing on hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and hydrophobic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) was designed and incorporated into a crosslinked PDMS matrix to form a surface-renewable antifouling coating. In the copolymer, PVP segments possessed a chemical stability and could prevent the settlement of fouling organisms attributable to its strong hydrophilicity; PDMS endowed the copolymer with compatibility to PDMS matrix and could efficiently reduce the fouling adhesion strength attributable to the low surface energy. Based on the surface-active copolymer, the coating could be reconstructed underwater in response to the environment forming a renewable surface to promote the fouling-release property. In addition, a set of controllable composition coatings were prepared to investigate the effects of surface chemistry on antifouling and fouling-release performance. Laboratory bioassays against marine unicellular diatom adhesion (???99 % reduction) and mimetic barnacle attachment (???81 % reduction) demonstrated an outstanding antifouling and fouling-release property of the copolymer-based coating compared to pristine PDMS, and the coating with a higher PVP content exhibited a better performance. Moreover, a long-term antifouling capability in marine field test (???4 months) was also demonstrated. This work may offer a promising solution to the problems induced by marine biofouling. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
Q6FRFEQV,Numerical modeling of casing collapse in Gachsaran formation in Sirri-E oilfield in Persian Gulf,"Casing collapse is a costly phenomenon in drilling industry that occurred in different geological environment with different geomechanical property. Geomechanical and numerical analysis of casing collapse in Sirri-E, one of the offshore Iranian oilfield in Persian Gulf has been investigated in this work. In this study we tried to model several collapse loading of rock-cement-casing system under real condition of in-situ stress and geomechanical property of different lithology, cement and casing, to decrease simplified modeling assumption. A mechanical earth model is built to determine the accurate amount of in-situ stresses and different mechanical property of rock. This geomechanical data extracted from 1D geomechanical earth model and entered to numerical model involved formation, cement and casing. Furthermore the interactions between the casing and surrounding formation are simulated by applied elastic-plastic behavior for rock and cement. Also Joint property between different media considered to increase the accuracy of model to real condition of borehole at the collapsing depth. The result show that over pressured marl and salt have high potential for casing collapse and the maximum external load applied to the casing is very more than maximum mud weight that usually considered in API standard for design of casing. So it is necessary to use coupled data from mechanical earth modeling and numerical analysis to determine maximum lithostatic pressure applied to the casing. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
M6YJEDTQ,Life cycle assessment of plastic grocery bags and their alternatives in cities with confined waste management structure: A Singapore case study,"Plastic grocery bags are one of the most ubiquitous single-use packaging products. Recently, ?????eco-friendly????? options of plastic grocery bags have gained traction such as kraft paper, cotton, biodegradable, and reusable polypropylene non-woven bags. However, the impact of using various grocery bags in cities with dense population, well-developed infrastructure and thermal treatment as an end-of-life waste management option has been insufficiently documented. In this study, commonly found single-use (HDPE, biodegradable plastic, kraft paper) bags and reusable (cotton, polypropylene non-woven) bags were considered for the life cycle assessment (LCA). The usage characteristics (reusability, dimensions, carrying capacity) of bags, the production process (raw materials extraction, production processes), and emissions were determined as the significant factors contributing to the negative environmental impacts. In a model city with confined waste management, the assessment determined that the reusable polypropylene non-woven bag (PNB) caused the least overall negative environmental impacts when there are 50 instances of reuse, followed by single use HDPE plastic bag (HPB). The global warming potential (excluding biogenic carbon) was 14, 81, 17 and 16 times higher for HDPE plastic, kraft paper, cotton woven and biodegradable polymer bags, respectively, when compared to PNB. Moreover, kraft paper or cotton woven bags demonstrated the highest negative impacts for the impact categories including abiotic fossil depletion, freshwater-, marine- and terrestrial-ecotoxicities, human toxicity, acidification and eutrophication potentials. Further, sensitivity analysis indicated that the inflexion point for the PNB was minimum 4 reuses to avoid emission equivalent to the HPB. Singapore was adopted as the model city with confined waste management structure that imports most of the grocery bags, either as finished goods or as raw materials. Through comprehensive insights based on the new outlook of the integrated LCA model (cradle-to-grave) that included full-scale transportation component, the usage of the real case data from a city to develop the life cycle inventory, and consideration of the existing grocery bags options, the environmental assessment along with critical evaluation was conducted. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0

B7KEG95V,Feasibility of glass/basalt fiber reinforced seawater coral sand mortar for 3D printing,"In remote islands and coastal areas, where there are no freshwater and river sand, the use of locally available seawater and marine sediments in mortar and concrete for building construction may be a better solution. Moreover, if there are no local materials for fabricating the formwork, 3D mortar/concrete printing may be considered. However, study on 3D printing using mortar/concrete made of seawater and marine sediments is still lacking. In this study, a series of mortar mixes made of seawater, coral sand, and glass or basalt fibers were produced to test their fresh and hardened properties for the purpose of developing 3D printable glass/basalt fiber reinforced seawater coral sand mortars. It was found that by adjusting the water reducer dosage, all the mortar mixes exhibited good buildability. The addition of glass or basalt fibers improved the flexural strength to some extent but slightly reduced the compressive strength. However, the flexural and compressive strengths of the printed specimens were significantly lower than those of the standard un-printed specimens. Overall, the fiber reinforced seawater coral sand mortar exhibits great potential to be applied as 3D printable cement-based material for use in remote areas. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
CGCQCCMM,"Tolerance of some warm-season turfgrasses to compaction under shade and sunlight conditions in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","We evaluated the compaction tolerance of some warm-season turfgrasses under shade and sunlight conditions in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Hybrid bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon, cultivars ?????Tifway????? and ?????Tifsport,????? seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum) and its cultivar ?????Sea Isle 2000????? were used. The study area was divided into two sections: one was exposed to sunlight and the other was maintained under 70% shade using a green plastic grille. Turfgrasses were planted using ?????sods????? in beds containing a mixture of sand, silt, and peat moss (4: 1: 1, v/v). The soil was compacted using a locally-made 250 kg cylindrical roll, passing four times over the grown turfgrasses for 3 days/week. The results showed that plant height, leaf area, grass quality and color were decreased by compaction in both the shade and sunlight areas. Plant height in the shaded area with or without compaction was higher than in the sunlight area. Under compaction, ?????Sea Isle 2000????? was the shortest: 8.8 cm in the sunlight and 14.3 cm in the shade. For grasses grown in sunlight, compaction decreased grass height, and height was lowest (4.0 cm) for paspalum ?????Sea Isle 2000????? in January. In the shaded area, paspalum turfgrass retained its high quality (4.0) in April, May, and June. In the sunlight area, the grass quality was highest (4.0) in ?????Sea Isle 2000????? and the lowest (3.0) in ?????Tifsport.????? Paspalum turfgrass showed a higher color degree (4) than bermudagrass (2.5) in April, May, and June. Compaction also led to a decline in leaf area and fresh and dry weights of all grown turfgrasses. The grass density was high for paspalum turfgrasses, indicating that their resistance to compaction was greater than bermudagrasses. It can be concluded that the best compaction and shade-tolerant turfgrasses are ?????Sea Isle 2000????? and seashore paspalum. ?? 2020",0
7ZJJ48GU,"Ingestion of anthropogenic materials by yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) in natural, urban, and landfill sites along Portugal in relation to diet composition","Pollution is a global concern, increasing rapidly throughout marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and affecting many species. Urbanization enhances waste production, leading to the opening of landfills that constitute a spatially and temporally predictable food source for opportunistic species. Several species of gulls are known to exploit and breed in urban areas, taking advantage of accessible and diverse food resources. The exploitation of anthropogenic food subsidies at sea (e.g. fishery discards), urban sites, and landfills leads to debris ingestion by gulls with potential negative effects. Here we characterize anthropogenic debris ingested by yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) along Portugal, by analysing the content of pellets collected in (1) natural and urban breeding locations, and in (2) urban and landfill resting sites, to assess seasonal patterns in the ingestion of anthropogenic debris. We also relate diet with the presence of anthropogenic debris. Debris materials were found in 28.8% of pellets from breeding locations (natural and urban) and in 89.7% of pellets from resting sites (urban and landfill). Gulls from the most urbanized breeding location exhibited higher levels of ingested materials during the entire breeding cycle, however, gulls from a natural breeding site also ingested high levels of debris during the pre-breeding season. At resting sites, small seasonal differences were detected in the number and mass of debris items ingested, which were both higher during spring and summer. Gulls that typically fed on pelagic fish had significantly less sheet and fragment plastics in their pellets. The presence of certain debris categories in gull pellets was positively related to the presence of some prey items, suggesting that gulls may accidentally ingest debris while foraging at multiple habitats. The quantity of anthropogenic materials ingested by gulls from urban locations and landfills indicates a need for improved waste management. ?? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",0
QGWBHUVL,Simulation of axial tensile well deformation during reservoir compaction in offshore unconsolidated methane hydrate-bearing formation,"Sand production encountered in the 2013 offshore field gas production tests at the Nankai Trough, Japan, could be attributed to well failure during reservoir compaction. In this study, well integrity under various reservoir compaction patterns for the Nankai Trough case is examined using a well-formation finite element model. The modelling details include the inclusion of a cement sheath as well as the modelling of construction processes (such as cement shrinkage). Well elongation in the overburden layer becomes significant when the reservoir subsidence is localized near the wellbore under large depressurization. Results show that the maximum plastic deviatoric strain level in the cement could reach 0.7% when the maximum reservoir subsidence reaches 0.85 m and cement shrinkage is limited. When cement shrinkage rises to 0.75%, the maximum plastic deviatoric strain increases to 2.4% as the cement accumulates additional plastic strain during shrinkage due to its deformation being constrained by the casing. In order to prevent the cement from failure, it might be effective to hold the pressure drawdown at a low level (e.g., several MPa) until the hydrate dissociation front advances to a certain radius from the well (e.g., a couple of tens of metres). ?? 2020",0
LRQT3BTV,TEMPO oxidized cellulose nanofibers-based heterogenous membrane employed for concentration-gradient-driven energy harvesting,"The development and utilization of renewable clean energy has become a common way out for the world to solve energy crisis. The concentration gradient between sea water and river water is widely regarded as a very significant sustainable energy resource because of its easy availability and abundant reserves. Therefore, it is necessary for rapid technical breakthrough of membrane engineering in order to capture this energy existing in the fluidic system. Herein, we develop nanofluidic device that can harvest osmotic energy and rectify ionic transport by directly prepared with a nanoporous TOCNs membrane and a conical variable-channel porous polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate membrane. 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO) oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNs) nanofluidic device possesses the advantages of well-tunable geometry and high charges density, which develop an attractive material for the control of ion flow. The optimized TOCNs heterogeneous membrane shows prominent cation selectivity and ion current rectification ratio of 562. When applying this TOCNs heterogeneous membrane for a concentration-gradient-driven device, a high power density reaches 0.96 W/m2, which exhibits great promise for energy harvesting device. Overall, this work provides an effective way for devising cellulose nanofibers-based nanofluidic device and can promote the development of concentration-gradient-driven energy conversion system. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
37ZEUNYR,"Antipredator behaviour affected by prey condition, food availability and pH-mediated info-disruption","Prey around the world experience the risk of predation, and most have evolved constitutive and phenotypically plastic defences in response. Phenotypically plastic defences often come with trade-offs related to foraging, such that the magnitude of defence is mediated by body condition and food availability. Such adaptive responses are beneficial to prey, and there is an increasing appreciation that they can be disrupted by chemical compounds resulting from human activities. We examined predator-induced behaviours in freshwater snails (Physa acuta) using 32 combinations of different concentrations of olfactory predator cues, body condition and food availability to understand how they respond to the trade-off between avoiding predators and obtaining food. Using a subset of these conditions (16 environments), we then examined how snail responses were altered by increases or decreases in pH. We found that snails responded to increased predator cue concentrations with a shape consistent with a saturating response curve and that low body condition and low food availability weakened these responses. When we increased pH (from 7.8 to 9.5), snails exhibited weaker predator avoidance responses, but only in the absence of food. When we decreased pH (from 7.8 to 6.0), snails exhibited stronger predator avoidance responses and stronger declines in foraging, but only in the presence of food. Collectively, these results suggest that changes in pH due to acid mine drainage, eutrophication and ocean acidification may substantially alter the adaptive responses of aquatic animals. Future work should determine whether such info-disruption is common in other taxa, determine the underlying mechanisms and quantify the consequences of info-disruption to predator?????prey and prey?????resource interactions. ?? 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour",0
PY7MC9NF,Durability of coral-reef-sand concrete beams reinforced with basalt fibre-reinforced polymer bars in seawater,"A combination of coral reef sand (CRS) concrete and fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars provides an effective solution to the durability deficiency in conventional RC structures. This study experimentally investigates the durability of CRS concrete beams reinforced with basalt FRP (BFRP) bars in a simulated marine environment. Flexural tests are conducted on a total of fourteen CRS concrete beams aged in a cyclic wet-dry saline solution at temperatures of 25, 40 and 55??C. The variables comprise the types of reinforcement (steel and BFRP), the aging duration and the temperature. The failure modes, capacities, deflections and crack development of the beams are analysed and discussed. The results indicate that the ultimate load of the beams exhibits no degradation after aging, whereas the failure mode of the BFRP-CRS concrete beams transition from flexure to shear, which is caused by the degradation in the mechanical properties of the stirrups. The aged BFRP-CRS concrete beams show a substantial increase of over 70% in their initial stiffness compared with the control beams (beams without aging) and a substantial decrease in their crack width after aging due to the prolonged maturation of the concrete. Furthermore, a formula for calculating the shear capacity in the existing code is modified by a partial factor equal to 2, which can predict the capacity of a CRS concrete beam reinforced with BFRP bars in a marine environment. ??

PGGYSLTQ,Comparative study on ductile fracture prediction of high-tensile strength marine structural steels,"Accidental events such as collision, grounding, and explosion in marine structures can cause plastic deformation and structural damage. Various fracture models based on different mechanical concepts have been proposed to predict damage extents involving ductile fracture. In this paper, some fracture models were evaluated: Maximum shear stress, Cockcroft-Latham, Johnson-Cook, Modified Mohr-Coulomb, Lou-Huh, and Hosford-Coulomb models. The model parameters were identified for two shipbuilding steel grades: AH36 and DH36. A hybrid experimental-numerical approach was adopted. The parameters of six fracture models were identified using an optimisation algorithm based on the extracted loading paths from the numerical simulations and adopting a linear damage accumulation law. The calibrated fracture models are presented in stress triaxiality and Lode angle parameter space as a 3D fracture locus, and under plain stress condition as a function of the stress triaxiality as a 2D fracture locus. The predictive capabilities and flexibility of the evaluated fracture models were discussed. ?? 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0

While the density of composites increases with the increase in the plant fiber content, the chemical foaming injection process was used to prepare straw fiber/PP foamed composites with exothermic foaming agent azodicarbonamide, in order to reduce the density of composite products and meet the requirements for lightweight automotive trim parts. The effects of temperature and fiber content on the mechanical properties and microstructures of the composites were investigated. Research results show that the microporous straw fiber/PP composites have close bond with the core layer fibers, the matrix, and the cells. The cells evenly distributed around the fibers to form a ?????sea island????? phase structure of the fiber microporous matrix, and the toughness of microporous sample is better than solid composites. Within a certain range, the cell density and the impact resistance of the microporous composites increases first and then decreases as the molding temperature increases, and maximize at 185 ??C. Straw fiber plays a role of nucleation and toughening in the microporous straw fiber/PP composite system. And as its content increases, the cell density increases, similarly the toughness of the composites increases. ?? 2020 The Textile Institute.",0
78B2D286,Improving the energy absorption capacity of square CFRP tubes with cutout by introducing chamfer,"Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tubes have been widely used as energy absorption devices. Because it is inclined to deform in progressive crushing mode (PCM) with low initial peak force Fp and high specific energy absorption SEA (the energy absorption per unit mass). In many cases, cutouts are introduced into these tubes to meet engineering requirements. However, the cutouts can cause a collapse in the middle height (i.e., mid-height collapse mode), and thus the SEA of the CFRP tubes is even reduced by 56%. Therefore, in this research, a chamfer is introduced into the CFRP tubes with cutout to trigger the PCM, thereby increasing the energy absorption capacity. A series of validation experiments show that the chamfer can trigger the PCM with about 64% decrease of Fp and 52% increase of SEA. The parameter study is conducted to investigate the effect of size and position of the cutout on the energy absorption of CFRP tubes with a 45-degree chamfer. The result indicates that the chamfer can eliminate the negative effects of cutouts and improve the energy absorption capacity in most cases. Furthermore, the contrastive analysis between CFRP and metal tubes reveals the difference in energy absorption characteristics of these two types of tubes and further explains the advantages of energy absorption of the CFRP tubes with a 45-degree chamfer and a cutout. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
AYV5QDEZ,Viscosity decrease by interfacial slippage between immiscible polymers,"The rheological behavior under pressure-driven shear flow was studied using binary blends with a sea-island structure. The addition of a low-viscosity dispersion having a high interfacial tension with the continuous phase greatly reduces the shear viscosity, for example, the addition of atactic polystyrene (PS) with a low viscosity to isotactic polypropylene (PP) and the addition of PP with a low viscosity to PS. The interfacial slippage occurs because of the poor adhesive strength with the enlarged interfacial area and is responsible for the viscosity decrease. When the dispersion has a similar viscosity to the continuous phase, the viscosity decrease is barely detected. This is because the deformation of dispersed droplets is restricted, which creates a small interfacial area. The interfacial tension between the continuous and dispersed phases plays a crucial role on the shear viscosity. In the case of PP, the addition of linear low-density polyethylene with a relatively low interfacial tension to PP has almost no impact on the shear viscosity. This is despite the polyethylene having a low viscosity. ?? 2021 Society of Plastics Engineers",0
ES9BMBMZ,Cyclic performance of a monopile in spatially variable clay using an advanced constitutive model,"The performance of monopiles in cohesive soils is of great interest for future offshore wind farm developments, particularly under the cyclic loads experienced in the ocean environment. Clay behaviour during undrained cyclic loading is complex and involves the accumulation of plastic strains, generation of excess pore-water pressures and degradation of initial stiffness. In this paper, the cyclic performance of a laterally-loaded monopile in spatially variable clay is investigated for the first time. A kinematic hardening constitutive model is used in a 3D finite element analysis to capture the hysteretic stress-strain behaviour of the clay. The monopile is installed in overconsolidated London Clay, which is present at several offshore wind farms in the Thames Estuary. The finite element model is coupled with random field representations of initial stiffness and clay structure. The statistical characterisation of the random fields was undertaken considering parameter ranges observed in laboratory tests. Under one-way cyclic loading, the monopile showed ratcheting behaviour, where pile rotation accumulates with increasing numbers of load cycles. The cyclic secant stiffness also increased due to the generation of negative excess pore-pressures in the clay. This behaviour occurred in both homogeneous and spatially variable clay. The monopile was also subjected to an extreme dynamic event and the soil response around the monopile showed increasing variability in stress-strain response and generation of excess pore-water pressure over time as plastic strain accumulated. However, the overall behaviour of the foundation was governed by a spatial average of the mobilised clay. The range in monopile response demonstrates how the natural spatial variability of clay can have a strong influence on monopile performance. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0

The ideas of bionic gradients and material mixtures are incorporated in the design to improve the damping and vibration isolation behaviors of the MGCLSPs. The compression and hysteresis responses of the empty and polyurethane foam-filled MGCLSPs are investigated experimentally and numerically. It is found that the MGCLSPs have better energy absorption characteristics than the non-gradient panels, and the MGCLSP specimen D1 which is positive gradient absorbs the most energy. The experimental results also show that the addition of polyurethane foam can enhance the strength and energy absorption characteristics of MGCLSPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0

A three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element model of AHSP under repeated impact loadings is established by using the commercial software ABAQUS Explicit. The accumulation processes of plastic deformation, the impact force-displacement curves as well as the energy absorption performances are numerically calculated. Besides, the repeated impact experiments of AHSPs were conducted by using the drop-weight impact testing machine INSTRON CEAST 9350. Furthermore, the influences of geometrical parameters on the dynamic behaviours of AHSPs under repeated impact loadings are further performed. Results show that the numerical calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental results. With the increase of the repeated impact numbers, the bending deflections of both top and bottom face sheets of AHPSs accumulate gradually, the compressive deformations of the honeycomb cores enlarge gradually and finally the densification phenomenon appears. The deformation mode of bottom face sheet experiences the mode transition from the global bending deformation model to the coupling deformation mode of the global bending deformations and the local indentations. ?? 2020",0
P89UZ9D7,Flexural damage response of symmetric cross-ply carbon fiber reinforced laminates: Effects of thickness and ply-scaling technique,"Advanced fiber reinforced composite materials have become relevant in aerospace, automotive, wind energy, marine, and civil engineering applications due to their high specific stiffness and strength, corrosion resistance, and fatigue performance. In addition, composite materials are subjected to complicated loading conditions, such as bending, tension, compression, and twisting. However, a significant characteristic of composite materials is their unequal compressive/tensile response. The aim of this work is to highlight the effects of laminate thickness and the type of scaling technique on the flexural response of symmetric cross-ply CFRP laminates, taking into account the unequal compressive/tensile response of these laminates. This different response has been analyzed in order to determine the failure mode exhibited by the laminates under flexural loading (flexural or interlaminar shear failure) and, additionally, where it was produced for design purposes. Three-point bending tests were carried out to determine the mechanical response in terms of strength and stiffness of the different CFRP laminates. Optical micrographs of fracture surfaces were used to assess failure mechanisms of the different configurations. It was observed that the effect of laminate thickness was significant. Thicker laminates show lower strength and strain to failure, but, conversely, higher bending stiffness. In addition, the results depict a significant change on the flexural damage performance with the stacking sequence and the type of scaling technique (sublaminate/ply-level) due to unequal compressive/tensile response. Finally, the results obtained demonstrate that introducing ply clustering had a negative effect on the [90/0] configuration, but, conversely, an improvement of the flexural damage performance on the [0/90] configuration. ?? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0
Y5TCMITU,Solid particle erosive wear study of polymer composite materials for wind turbine applications,"In this study, erosion wear tests in composites materials (carbon fiber and fiberglass) were performed in order to understand their behavior for blades of wind turbine applications. The erosion tests were also made in coated composites materials with a polyester resin (gel coat), to compare the wear erosion resistance with uncoated materials. The experimental tests were carried out according to some parameters to the ASTM G76 standard. The specimens had a rectangular shape with dimensions of 25 ?? 18 mm and a thickness of 4 mm. The erosive particle used was obtained from sea sand. High impact angles were used, 75??, 85??, and 90?? and the velocity particle was 12 m/s. The duration of each test was 6 min, removing the specimens every 2 min to measure the amount of mass loss. In order to identify the wear mechanisms, scanning electron microscopy was used. The results showed that fiberglass specimens had a higher mass loss at 90?? impact angle. The best erosive wear performance was obtained in the uncoated carbon fiber specimens at 85?? impact angle. ?? 2021 Society of Plastics Engineers",0
NHSY9IPY,Experimental and numerical investigation on welding simulation of long stiffened steel plate specimen,"The paper presents the results of metal inert gas T-joint fillet welding tests of small scale rectangular stiffened steel plates longer than the standard test specimen. In the literature the focus is typically on plates with a small aspect ratio and the present work deals with plates of higher aspect ratio, which are the typical ones in marine structures, aiming to determine if there is any significant effect of welding along the longitudinal direction. Nonlinear thermo-elasto-plastic finite element models are adopted to evaluate the temperature distribution, welding induced distortions and residual stress in the stiffened plates of shipbuilding steel. Given the difficulty in data acquisition of temperature-dependent properties of the material, a simplified model of the properties is proposed, based on the values at room temperature. Good agreement is observed between the measured and simulated temperatures, indicating that the current finite element approach is appropriate to simulate the welding process. The proposed simplified material model can be efficiently used in the finite element analysis of welded steel structures. It is concluded that the welding parameters have more significant influence on the structural responses than the dimension of the plate. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
A3KUXLLB,A meso-mechanical material model describing a crash behavior of 2D plain weave fabric composites,"In composite aircraft structures, woven carbon-fiber-reinforced composites are used as elements of the boxes to mitigate damage during crash events and provide a measure of protection for the passengers against abrupt decelerations. Due to their multi-scale damage effects and complex coupling between failure mechanisms, despite years of extensive works of researchers around the world, a complete and validated methodology for predicting crushing behavior of woven composite structures has not yet been achieved. In the present paper, experimental and numerical investigations were conducted. The principal contribution is to model and adapt failure mechanisms; fragmentation and kink-bandings, for plain weave fabric CFRP composites, within an advanced numerical model to predict the quasi-static crush behavior of hat-shape cross-section coupons. A meso-scale model, which accounts for intralaminar damage, implemented as a user subroutine VUMAT in Abaqus/Explicit was developed and used. Eight layers of stacked solid elements model were used with saw teeth type and 45?? chamfer-type triggering mechanisms to ensure a continuous stable crushing mode of failure. A comparison with experimental and existing numerical model Abq_Ply_Fabric results confirms the computational tool?????s accuracy. ?? 2021, Deutsches Zentrum f??r Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.",0
FYQYQW7N,Leaf morphological plasticity in three dominant tree species in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh in different salinity zones,"Mangrove tree species show plasticity in their leaf morphological traits in different salinity zones. However, leaf morphological plasticity and its causes in different salinity zones are incompletely understood. To understand the mechanism of plasticity, this study investigated the responses of three dominant tree species Sundri (Heritiera fomes), Gewa (Excoecaria agallocha) and Goran (Ceriops decandra) of the Sundarbans to the salinity gradients. A total of 17 leaf parameters were measured and quantified. All collected data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical tools to investigate leaf morphological plasticity. A wide range of phenotypic plasticity was observed in all leaf parameters studied among the salinity zones of the Sundarbans. One-way ANOVA and Tukey?????s posthoc test revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) in all leaf parameters among the salinity zones and confirming that there was a high degree of phenotypic plasticity among the salinity zones of the Sundarbans. Petiole length (PL), leaf area (LA) and leaf length/petiole length (LL/PL) showed high level of plasticity among the salinity zones of the Sundarbans for each species of Sundri, Gewa and Goran. Plasticity index (PI) was developed in this study for each species studied. High level of phenotypic plasticity in these leaf traits reflects fitness of these species to different saline environments. Our results provide clear evidence that all the leaf parameters measured for three tree species viz., Sundri, Gewa and Goran effectively utilizes a plastic strategy in different salinity zones in the Sundarbans. Morphological trait plasticity could serve as powerful biological indicators to predict the shift of leaf morphology in upcoming environmental change events like sea level rise and reduction of fresh water flow from upstream. ?? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",0
ZIUFKC8P,Large-scale investigation into iceberg-tsunamis generated by various iceberg calving mechanisms,"Mass balance analysis of ice sheets is a key component to understand the effects of global warming with iceberg calving as a significant contributor. Calving recently generated tsunamis of up to 50 m in amplitude endangering human beings and coastal infrastructure. Such iceberg-tsunamis (IBTs) have been investigated based on 66 unique large-scale experiments conducted in a 50 m ?? 50 m large basin at constant water depth h. The experiments involved five iceberg calving mechanisms: A: capsizing, B: gravity-dominated fall, C: buoyancy-dominated fall, D: gravity-dominated overturning and E: buoyancy-dominated overturning. The kinematics of the up to 187 kg heavy plastic blocks mimicking icebergs was measured with a motion sensor and the wave profiles were recorded with wave probes at up to 35 locations. The IBTs from the gravity-dominated mechanisms (B and D) are roughly an order of magnitude larger than from mechanisms A, C and E. Empirical equations for preliminary hazard assessment and mitigation for the maximum wave height, amplitude and period for both the near- and far-field are derived for the five calving mechanisms individually and combined. The relative released energy, Froude number and relative iceberg width are the most influential dimensionless parameters in these equations. A maximum wave height decay trend close to (r/h)???1.0 is observed, with r as the radial distance, in agreement with the theoretical wave decay from a point source. The empirical equations are applied to a past event resulting in a good agreement and the upscaled wave periods to typical Greenlandic conditions overlap with the lower spectrum of landslide-tsunamis. However, empirical equations for landslide-tsunamis were found to be of limited use to predict IBTs in the far-field supporting the need of the newly introduced empirical equations for IBT hazard assessment and mitigation. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
FY6UM42T,Durability of flexurally strengthened RC beams with prestressed CFRP sheet under wet?????dry cycling in a chloride-containing environment,"Using prestressed carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) to strengthen reinforced concrete (RC) members is currently considered a promising technology. This study aims to investigate the durability of RC beams externally strengthened with prestressed CFRP sheet in a chloride-containing environment. The prestressed load levels were set at 7.5%, and 15% of the ultimate tensile strength of the CFRP sheet at room temperature ( 26 ??C), and the test parameters included an inclined U-jacket (or not) and 90-day exposure to a wet?????dry cyclic environment. The wet?????dry cyclic condition was set as 8-h immersion in 3.5% NaCl solution at 40 ??C and 16-h drying at 25 ??C and 60% RH (relative humidity). After exposure to the wet?????dry environment, the prestressed CFRP sheet strengthened RC beams were tested under four-point bending test. The evolution of time-dependent prestress losses in the strengthened beam was discussed, and then the flexural behaviour of the strengthened beams was analyzed. Finally, a theoretical model based on the classical beam theory was proposed to predict the bearing capacity of prestressed-CFRP strengthened RC beams. The results show that the prestressed CFRP sheet can significantly improve the flexural performance of RC beams, and the cracking and ultimate loads of the RC beam strengthened with a prestressing level of 15% could increase by approximately 50% and 40%, respectively. Moreover, the inclined U-jacket enhanced the flexural performance of the strengthened RC beams and changed the failure mode from CFRP debonding to CFRP fracture. Although the exposure in chloride-containing environments increased the prestress losses, a 90-day exposure in the simulated subtropical marine climate environment did not cause a significant detrimental influence on the flexural performance of the strengthened RC beams. The proposed model agrees well with the experimental results, indicating it could conservatively predict the bearing capacity of strengthened RC beams failed by CFRP fracture. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
8UZM5ZUL,Oceanic giants in the Mediterranean: First mitochondrial analysis of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas [Oceanski divovi u Sredozemlju: Prva mitohondrijalna analiza sedmoprugih usminja??a (Dermochelys coriacea) iz Jadranskog i Tirenskog mora],"The leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea (Vandelli, 1761) is an occasional trophic visitor of the Mediterranean basin. So far, very few individuals have been genetically analysed from this sea and none from Italy. We sequenced a mitochondrial DNA fragment of three specimens of D. coriacea found in recent years along the North-Adriatic and Tyrrhenian shores. They were all females approaching adult stage. Causes of death were attributable to the main threats for sea turtles in Mediterranean waters, all related to human activities (collisions with boats, entanglement in fishing nets and plastic debris ingestion). Two different mitochondrial haplotypes were observed, with the two North-Adriatic turtles sharing the same one. Compared to known Dermochelys sequences and previous genetic characterization of rookeries, these results suggest that the most probable origin of at least two of the three leatherbacks was the western Atlantic. ?? 2020, Croatian Natural History Museum.

2WAUSDAF,The Anemonia sulcata Toxin BDS-I Protects Astrocytes Exposed to A??1-42 Oligomers by Restoring [Ca2+]i Transients and ER Ca2+ Signaling,"Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients in astrocytes represent a highly plastic signaling pathway underlying the communication between neurons and glial cells. However, how this important phenomenon may be compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unexplored. Moreover, the involvement of several K+ channels, including KV3.4 underlying the fast-inactivating currents, has been demonstrated in several AD models. Here, the effect of KV3.4 modulation by the marine toxin blood depressing substance-I (BDS-I) extracted from Anemonia sulcata has been studied on [Ca2+]i transients in rat primary cortical astrocytes exposed to A??1-42 oligomers. We showed that: (1) primary cortical astrocytes expressing KV3.4 channels displayed [Ca2+]i transients depending on the occurrence of membrane potential spikes, (2) BDS-I restored, in a dose-dependent way, [Ca2+]i transients in astrocytes exposed to A??1-42 oligomers (5 ??M/48 h) by inhibiting hyperfunctional KV3.4 channels, (3) BDS-I counteracted Ca2+ overload into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induced by A??1-42 oligomers, (4) BDS-I prevented the expression of the ER stress markers including active caspase 12 and GRP78/BiP in astrocytes treated with A??1-42 oligomers, and (5) BDS-I prevented A??1-42-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell suffering measured as mitochondrial activity and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Collectively, we proposed that the marine toxin BDS-I, by inhibiting the hyperfunctional KV3.4 channels and restoring [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency, prevented A??1-42-induced ER stress and cell suffering in astrocytes.",0
95TRSCKY,Bond performance between FRP tubes and seawater sea sand concrete after exposure to seawater condition,"In this study the durability of the bond between different fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) tubes and seawater sea sand concrete (SWSSC) under seawater condition is investigated. Concrete filled pultruded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) tubes and filament winding GFRP, carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) and basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) tubes were exposed to seawater at 25 ??C and 40 ??C for 1, 3 and 6 months. Push-out tests were carried out to study the bond performance of concrete filled FRP tubes (CFFT). The bond strength changes compared to the reference samples, in terms of the mechanical and chemical bonds, were calculated. The results showed that for all cases except one condition that had the same value as the reference, the maximum bond strength of the tubes increased due to the conditioning, however, the bond strength at the chemical adhesion breaking moment decreased by the conditioning. In other words, the friction coefficients of the samples increased due to conditioning, while the chemical adhesion decreased. Equations are proposed to predict the bond strength corresponding to slip initiations. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
RVRCRL24,Flexural behavior of seawater sea-sand coral concrete?????UHPC composite beams reinforced with BFRP bars,"A new type of cost-efficient concrete beam that is suitable for island environments, namely, a seawater sea-sand coral concrete (Coral-SWSSC)?????ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) composite beam reinforced with basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars, was proposed in this paper. In these beams, the top 1/8 of the Coral-SWSSC was replaced with UHPC, and both the longitudinal bars and the stirrups were BFRP reinforcements. In addition, a new type of BFRP-wrapped steel tube (BWST) was placed in the tension zone of the beams as additional tensile reinforcement to further increase the performance. The test results showed that compared with the pure BFRP bar-reinforced Coral-SWSSC beams, the new hybrid beams exhibited much better comprehensive bending performance. The ultimate bending capacity, ultimate displacement, and energy consumption were effectively improved by adopting the UHPC replacement layer alone, and the flexural stiffness was improved significantly by adopting the BWST alone. However, when the UHPC replacement layer and the BWST were adopted simultaneously, the abovementioned performance metrics were all improved. The new hybrid beam proposed in this paper has good future application prospects in remote island environments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0

WSG49NGI,Corrosion behavior of cold sprayed 7075Al composite coating reinforced with TiB2 nanoparticles,"Cold spray (CS), as a novel surface treatment technique, has been widely used for repairing damaged components and as protecting coatings, especially for the applications of aircraft and marine components. To further improve the mechanical properties, while maintaining the corrosion resistance of pure Al and Al alloy coatings, ceramic particles are commonly added into the Al matrix to produce particle-strengthened Al matrix composite (P-AMC) coatings. In this study, dense 7075Al composite coatings reinforced with uniformly distributed in-situ TiB2 nanoparticles (hereafter named TiB2/7075Al) were successfully produced by CS using a gas-atomized composite powder and the propulsive gases of air and helium. Following this, the corrosion behavior of the cold sprayed (CSed) TiB2/7075Al composites was investigated using Tafel polarization, electrochemical impedance, spectroscopy, and immersion tests in 0.1 M and 0.6 M NaCl solutions, and were compared to those of the CSed pure 7075Al coating and bulk 7075Al-T6 material. Electrochemical tests revealed that the composite coating exhibits a higher corrosion rate than the pure 7075Al coating, primarily caused by a galvanic coupling between TiB2 nanoparticles and the more active Al matrix. Compared to the air-processed coatings, the He-processed ones exhibit higher densities of defects, like dislocations, and precipitates due to larger plastic deformation of the sprayed particles, which result in more active sites for corrosion and thus lower corrosion resistance. Low-temperature annealing treatment (230 ??C/6 h) reduces these defects to increase the corrosion resistance of the CSed coatings. Comparatively, high-temperature annealing treatment (412 ??C/4 h) results in the coarsening of precipitates and grain growth to increase the corrosion rate of the coatings. Corrosion mechanisms of the CSed and annealed composite coatings related to the microstructure evolution were investigated in detail. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
JI3VP3WV,Some aspects regarding the influence of humidity on the tensile characteristics of GFRP composite material,"Composite materials have experienced great development in recent years, replacing traditional materials. Designed as metastructures, their properties recommend them in different fields, from sports materials to those in aeronautic and energy industries. In combinations of metallic layers or composites based on carbon/glass fibers, the properties of these materials allowed both the miniaturization of devices and the construction of large lightweight components. The paper aims to present the results of the tensile evaluation of the glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP), used in the construction of wind turbine blades. The blades are the most critical components of the wind turbines, being exposed to the damage and the defects that appear during operation can lead to the loss of the integrity of the blade structure. In order to increase the lifetime and to study the defects during operation, tensile tests were performed to determine the mechanical properties on a dry specimen, reinforced at [0 / 90 ], and the results obtained were compared with two specimens subjected to immersion in water for 14 and 21 days, two other specimens were immersed in seawater (Black Sea) for 14 and 21 days and one specimen was immersed in liquid nitrogen for 4 days. ??

All sizes of microplastic particles were actively consumed and excreted via fecal pellets, however, copepods displayed a significant preference for beads sized 6 ??m. In a mixture of algae and microplastics beads of 6 ??m, microplastics consumption rates linearly (r2 = 0.78, n = 154) increased 800 times from 50.8 ?? 17.3 to 8,612 ?? 5,972 beads ind?????1 day?????1 with an increase in bead concentration from 10 to 44,000 beads ml?????1. The total and basal metabolic rates as well as time spent swimming for C. helgolandicus, decreased 1.7, 1.8 and about 3-fold, respectively after 7?????8 days exposure to microplastic treatments, which was similar to the metabolism and activity of starving animals in filtered water. In copepods consuming microplastics, all vital parameters decreased on the first day of exposure, indicating either accelerated starvation, probably due to increased losses of energy and biological matter in the formation of fecal pellets and/or traumatic/toxic effects of the polystyrene beads on the copepods. Our data from laboratory experiments indicate that the presence of large concentrations of microplastics in water, even when mixed with algae, lowered energy metabolism levels of C. helgolandicus. ??

8VTILBJK,Response of structure models to sinusoidal dynamic action,"The use of small-sized models of structures printed on 3-D printers is possible due to the electroelastic properties of ABS plastic. A comparison of their reactions with analogs made of plexiglas, used in studies of concrete structures, was made. The influence of the environment - water or sea sand, support conditions - free support or pinching, shape - simple or complex in planon the response of models from two different materials was investigated. The laboratory setup simulated a dynamic sinusoidal effect using: a digital frequency generator from 1 to 10000 Hz, an acoustic system diffuser, a microphone amplifier, two electrodes, and a computer in a two-channel oscilloscope mode. The vibration characteristics at the base and top of the models were recorded. The experimental system turned out to be sensitive to the shape, methods of fastening elements, the structure as a whole, and the medium of wave propagation. The response was analyzed in terms of the dynamic compliance coefficient and resonance frequencies, reflecting the similarity of the responses of the plexiglas and ABS models. Printing will allow you to adjust the shape and connections of the elements of the models so that they work like mechanical resonators - filters - in a narrow band. No resonances are expected outside this band. In the operated structures, the quality of the element connections is reproduced. Changing the existing rigidity to obtain resonances in a narrow band can serve as a criterion for choosing an effective amplification method. ?? The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",0
BS3JCU9P,Determination of microplastic content in seafood: An integrated approach combined with the determination of elemental contaminants,"A method for the determination of microplastic (MP) content in seafood is proposed based on the selective digestion of seafood without the degradation of MP. A simple approach was developed using diluted acid with microwave-assisted wet digestion. The following parameters were evaluated: nitric acid concentration (0.5 to 14.4 mol L???1), digestion temperature (180 to 220 ??C), irradiation program holding time (10 to 30 min), MP particle size (0.3 to 5 mm), and the seafood mass (0.5 to 2 g). To develop a reliable method for the determination of MP amount, up to 2 g of an in natura seafood sample were spiked with a known amount of MP (100 mg of mixed MP). Suitable conditions were obtained using 1 mol L???1 HNO3 at 200 ??C (10 min holding time). Digests were filtered and the plastic content was gravimetrically determined. The heating program was 20 min, which represents a significant reduction in the time normally reported in the literature for MP analysis (from few hours up to 3 days). The proposed method allowed gravimetric determination of eight plastic types (polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, expanded polystyrene, polypropylene, high and low density polyethylene, polycarbonate and polyvinyl chloride) with particle size ???0.3 mm. Up to 2 g of an in natura seafood sample (shark species, acoupa weakfish, tuna fish, trahira, and pink shrimp) were efficiently digested, which opened the possibility of using the proposed digestion method for determining elemental contaminants (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, and Zn). Thus, as the main feature of the proposed digestion method is the possibility of determining MP and elemental contaminants using the same digestion protocol, saves time and reagents and provides accurate and precise information about different classes of marine pollutants (MP and elemental contaminants). ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
CCX7CMVE,The toxicity of virgin and UV-aged PVC microplastics on the growth of freshwater algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"Although more attention has been paid to plastic pollution in marine ecosystems, research on the influence of plastic in freshwater ecosystems remains limited. To help fill this information gap, this article represents an investigation of the effects of virgin polyvinyl chloride (v-PVC) microplastics (MPs) and UV-aged polyvinyl chloride (a-PVC) MPs on the growth and chlorophyll content of the freshwater algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) at different periods (0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h). The results suggest that both virgin and aged PVC MPs have negative effects on the growth of C. reinhardtii in the range of 10 mg/L to 200 mg/L, which leads to the reduction of chlorophyll-a level in the cells. Furthermore, a-PVC MPs were more toxic than v-PVC MPs, as shown by the a-PVC MPs' lower EC50 values after 96 h (63.66 mg/L for a-PVC MPs and 104.93 mg/L for v-PVC MPs). The inhibition effect of both kinds of PVC was also testified by the enhancement of enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in algae. Meanwhile, a-PVC MPs obviously had a higher toxicity than v-PVC MPs. The aging process that affected the surface characteristics of a-PVC was identified using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Zetasizer. The carbonyl groups formed on the surface and the increased zeta potential of the a-PVC MPs affected the interaction between the microplastics and the algae, which increased the toxicity of aged microplastics. The research results presented here provide more evidence of the risks microplastics bring into the freshwater ecosystem. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
8CQTYW54,Marine hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria breakdown poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET),"Pollution of aquatic ecosystems by plastic wastes poses severe environmental and health problems and has prompted scientific investigations on the fate and factors contributing to the modification of plastics in the marine environment. Here, we investigated, by means of microcosm studies, the role of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), the main constituents of plastic bottles, in the marine environment. To this aim, different bacterial consortia, previously acclimated to representative hydrocarbons fractions namely, tetradecane (aliphatic fraction), diesel (mixture of hydrocarbons), and naphthalene/phenantrene (aromatic fraction), were used as inocula of microcosm experiments, in order to identify peculiar specialization in poly(ethylene terephthalate) degradation. Upon formation of a mature biofilm on the surface of poly(ethylene terephthalate) films, the bacterial biodiversity and degradation efficiency of each selected consortium was analyzed. Notably, significant differences on biofilm biodiversity were observed with distinctive hydrocarbons-degraders being enriched on poly(ethylene terephthalate) surface, such as Alcanivorax, Hyphomonas, and Cycloclasticus species. Interestingly, ATR-FTIR analyses, supported by SEM and water contact angle measurements, revealed major alterations of the surface chemistry and morphology of PET films, mainly driven by the bacterial consortia enriched on tetradecane and diesel. Distinctive signatures of microbial activity were the alteration of the FTIR spectra as a consequence of PET chain scission through the hydrolysis of the ester bond, the increased sample hydrophobicity as well as the formation of small cracks and cavities on the surface of the film. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that hydrocarbons-degrading marine bacteria have the potential to degrade poly(ethylene terephthalate), although their degradative activity could potentially trigger the formation of harmful microplastics in the marine environment. ?? 2020",0
GDXWHQRL,Beach-dune morphodynamics and marine macro-litter abundance: An integrated approach with Unmanned Aerial System,"This work shows an integrated approach for coastal environmental monitoring, which aimed to understand the relation between beach-dune morphodynamics, marine litter abundance and environmental forcing. Three unmanned aerial system (UAS) flights were deployed on a beach-dune system at the Atlantic Portuguese coast to assess two main goals: (i) quantifying the morphological changes that occurred among flights, with focus on dune erosion, and (ii) mapping the changes of marine macro-litter abundance on the shore. Two most vulnerable-to-erosion sectors of the beach were identified. In the northern sector, the groin affected the downdrift shoreline, with dune erosion of about 1 m. In the central part of the beach, the dunes recessed about 4 m during the winter, being more exposed to environmental forcing due to the absence of dune vegetation. Marine litter occupation area on the beach decreased from 25% to 20% over the winter, with octopus pots (13%) and fragments (69%) being the most abundant items on average. Litter distribution varied in relation to swash elevation, wind speed and direction. With low swash elevation, the wind played a predominant role in moving the stranded items northwards, whereas high swash elevation concentrated the items at the dune foot. This study emphasizes the potential of UAS in allowing an integrated approach for coastal erosion monitoring and marine litter mapping, and set the ground for marine litter dynamic modelling on the shore. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
QJMR5UNT,Distribution Patterns of Microplastics in Seawater Surface at a Portuguese Estuary and Marine Park,"Measuring local levels of marine pollution by microplastics (MP) and identifying potential sources in coastal areas is essential to evaluate the associated impacts to environment and biota. The accumulation of floating MP at the sea surface is of great concern as the neustonic habitat consists of a feeding ground for primary consumers (including filter-feeders) and active predators, which makes these organisms a relevant via of MP input into the marine trophic chain. Here, a baseline evaluation of MP accumulation at the sea surface was conducted with a neuston net (335 ??m mesh) at the Arr??bida coastal area, in Portugal. The study site encompasses a marine protected area and an estuary, both under strong anthropogenic pressures due to multiple activities taking place. A short-term investigation on local spatiotemporal distribution, concentration and composition of MP was performed for the first time, through the monthly collection (summer 2018 to winter 2019) of samples at 6 stations. All the neuston samples contained MP and their mean concentration was 0.45 ?? 0.52 items m???3 (mean ?? SD). Both the averaged MP:neuston and MP:ichthyoplankton ratios were higher in December, when concentrations of organisms decreased. Temporal distribution patterns followed expected trends, as MP concentration was clearly higher in winter months due to precipitation and runoff. Although mean MP concentrations did not vary significantly between sampling stations, there was a spatial distribution of MP in relation to particle shape and size. Fragments were the most abundant shape and MP belonging to 1?????2 mm size class were dominant. Amongst a diversity of 10 polymers identified by FTIR analysis, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and copolymer PP/PE were the most abundant. Potential links between local sources/activities and the different polymers were suggested. Altogether, the information provided in this study aims to raise awareness among the identified sectors and consequently to act toward the prevention of MP inputs in the region. ??

C64S6U6U,Reduced growth with increased quotas of particulate organic and inorganic carbon in the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi under future ocean climate change conditions,"Effects of ocean acidification and warming on marine primary producers can be modulated by other environmental factors, such as levels of nutrients and light. Here, we investigated the interactive effects of five oceanic environmental drivers (CO2, temperature, light, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate) on the growth rate, particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) quotas of the cosmopolitan coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi. The population growth rate increased with increasing temperature (16 to 20 ??C) and light intensities (60 to 240 ??molphotonsm-2 s-1) but decreased with elevated pCO2 concentrations (370 to 960 ??atm) and reduced availability of nitrate (24.3 to 7.8 ??molL-1) and phosphate (1.5 to 0.5 ??molL-1). POC quotas were predominantly enhanced by the combined effects of increased pCO2 and decreased availability of phosphate. PIC quotas increased with decreased availability of nitrate and phosphate. Our results show that concurrent changes in nutrient concentrations and pCO2 levels predominantly affected the growth, photosynthetic carbon fixation and calcification of E. huxleyi and imply that plastic responses to progressive ocean acidification, warming, and decreasing availability of nitrate and phosphate reduce the population growth rate while increasing cellular quotas of particulate organic and inorganic carbon of E. huxleyi, ultimately affecting coccolithophore-related ecological and biogeochemical processes. ??

24YF7L6Q,Nano- and microplastics trigger secretion of protein-rich extracellular polymeric substances from phytoplankton,"The substantial increase in plastic pollution in marine ecosystems raises concerns about its adverse impacts on the microbial community. Microorganisms (bacteria, phytoplankton) are important producers of exopolymeric substances (EPS), which govern the processes of marine organic aggregate formation, microbial colonization, and pollutant mobility. Until now, the effects of nano- and micro-plastics on characteristics of EPS composition have received little attention. This study investigated EPS secretion by four phytoplankton species following exposure to various concentrations of polystyrene nano- and microplastics (55 nm nanoparticles; 1 and 6 ??m microparticles). The 55 nm nanoparticles induced less growth/survival (determined on a DNA basis) and produced EPS with higher protein-to-carbohydrate (P/C) ratios than the exposure to microplastic particles. The amount of DNA from the four marine phytoplankton showed a higher negative linear correlation with increasing P/C ratios, especially in response to nanoplastic exposure. These results provide evidence that marine phytoplankton are quite sensitive to smaller-sized plastics and actively modify their EPS chemical composition to cope with the stress from pollution. Furthermore, the release of protein-rich EPS was found to facilitate aggregate formation and surface modification of plastic particles, thereby affecting their fate and colonization. Overall, this work offers new insights into the potential harm of different-sized plastic particles and a better understanding of the responding mechanism of marine phytoplankton for plastic pollution. The data also provide needed information about the fate of marine plastics and biogenic aggregation and scavenging processes. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
HIAXC92V,"Spatial distribution of microplastics around an inhabited coral island in the Maldives, Indian Ocean","Small plastic particles are considered environmental pollutants and are highly concentrated in marine sediments. However, knowledge about plastic abundance within coral reef habitat and beach sediments surrounding remote inhabited coral islands is scarce. In this study, microplastic accumulation was investigated on a small inhabited coral island located in the Maldives. Sediments from 22 sampling sites across fore reef, reef flat, and beach environments were analysed for plastic particles <5 mm. Density separation and microscope enumeration revealed a total of 1244 individual microplastic pieces, in filamentous (49%) and fragmented (51%) forms, found across all sampling sites. High concentrations were recorded at all sites, however, there was no significant relationship between microplastic concentration or size across regions (inner atoll and outer atoll) or environments (fore reef, reef flat, and beach). Furthermore, concentrations of microplastic fragment and filament forms, total concentration, and the microplastic community, showed little correlation with sediment particle size. Our findings show microplastics are ubiquitous in marine sediments around a remote coral island, at sizes ingestible by marine organisms, raising concerns about potential effects of microplastic ingestion by coral reef species. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1
RGV8PUYG,Plastics Are an Insignificant Carrier of Riverine Organic Pollutants to the Coastal Oceans,"Global rivers act as a dominant transport pathway for land-based plastic debris to the marine environment. Organic pollutants (OPs) affiliated with riverine plastics can also enter the global oceans, but their amounts remain unknown. Microplastic (MP) samples were collected in a one-year sampling event from the surface water of the eight main riverine outlets in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, and analyzed for OPs affiliated with MPs, including 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), eight polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The mean concentrations of MP-affiliated ??16PAH, ??8PBDE, and ??14PCB were 2010 (range: 25-40,100), 412 (range: 0.84-14,800), and 67.7 (range: 1.86-456) ng g-1, respectively. Based on these and previous results, the annual riverine outflows of MP-affiliated OPs were 148, 83, and 8.03 g for ??16PAH, ??8PBDE, and ??14PCB, respectively. Assuming that plastic debris of different sizes contained the same concentrations of the target pollutants as MPs, the mean riverine outflows of plastic-bound ??16PAH, ??8PBDE, and ??14PCB were 6.75, 3.77, and 0.37 kg year-1, respectively, which were insignificant compared with the riverine outflows of OPs through riverine water discharge (up to hundred tons per year). Apparently, plastics are an insignificant carrier of riverine OPs to the coastal oceans. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",0
KI9D6DW5,"Microplastic particles in sediments and waters, south of Caspian Sea: Frequency, distribution, characteristics, and chemical composition","This study assesses the occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in coastal and sea surface sediments, as well as water samples, collected from the coastal region of the southern Caspian Sea, Mazandaran province, Iran. A total of 32 sediment and 10 water samples were studied. The mean concentration of MPs was 15 units kg???1 in the sediments and 710 units m???3 in the coastal water. Fibers constituted by far the dominant MPs in both media, accounting for 97% of the MPs in both sediment and water samples. The MPs were mainly black in color. The dominant size of MP particles in sediment samples was between 250 and 500 ??m, while the fraction &gt;1000 ??m dominated in the water samples. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and nylon (NYL) were the main polymers and/or copolymers composing MPs in both sediment and water samples. The MP particles had a relatively smooth surface morphology, although signs of weathering were observed. The number of MP particles in sediment and water samples showed a general decrease from west to east in the study area. This may be reflecting the spreading of MP loading from the outlets of Sefidrud, Tonekabon, Chalus, the major rivers entering the Caspian Sea just west of the study area, and the overall decrease in the spatial distribution of touristic and fishery activity. The main sources of MP particles could be local emissions from a large number of domestic wastewater effluents and urban surface runoff due to high population density, and industrial and fishing activities in this region. This study indicated that MP particles, based on their characteristics and chemical composition, are circulated between coastal waters, and shore and sea surface sediments of the Caspian Sea, leading to their uneven distribution in the different depths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the distribution of MP particles in sea surface sediments and also the most comprehensive on MPs in shoreline sediments and coastal waters in the southern Caspian Sea. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",1
F489CPJG,Cultivation of sponge Haliclona simulans juveniles in a floating sea raft,"Large-scale mariculture of a marine sponge requires a sustainable seed stock that can be raised artificially. To find the optimized breeding methods for Haliclona simulans juveniles, a study with three stages, starting from free swimming larvae, was performed in a field laboratory placed on a floating sea raft. In the first step, six different substrates were compared, and polystyrene plastic petri dishes were found to be the optimal substrates for settlement and metamorphosis of H. simulans swimming larvae. Then, in the second stage, 30-days growth experiments with 20 conditions were performed for the larvae settled on plastic petri dishes. The optimized devices and conditions suited for the early-stage cultivation of sponge larvae were obtained. In the final stage, a 4-months growth experiment was performed with the guidance of the optimized conditions acquired from the former stages. At the end of the experiment, the group with the highest growth rate achieved an average length of 18.44 ?? 10.73 mm, and the largest juvenile length reached 33.4 mm, equivalent to a 45-folds increase in length or over 20,000-folds increase in volume when compared to the larvae that just settled. Thus, we established a feasible and low-cost sponge-larval mariculture pattern, upon which the culturing procedures can be improved and the sustainable seed stock needed for sponge large-scale culture becomes possible. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
Q48RZDW6,Experimental and numerical analyses of elastic-plastic responses of ship plates under ice floe impacts,"Due to ice floe impacts or iceberg collisions, the side structures of ships and offshore platforms operating in Arctic region may experience permanent deformations, which may have significant influences on their structural safety and working performance. To provide insight into the plastic deformations of plates, this paper investigates the nonlinear elastic-plastic responses of plates impacted by an ice wedge striker and an idealized rigid striker by both experimental and numerical methods. The ice material model based on a soil and concrete material model is used in ANSYS/LS-DYNA program to simulate the ice mechanical behaviour in an ice-plate impact scenario. Good correlation is obtained between the experimental, numerical and analytical results for plastic deformations of plate and collision forces. The comparisons of elastic-plastic responses of plate under these two strikers are conducted by both model tests and numerical simulations. Besides, a series of numerical calculations are carried out to study the differences of ice-plate impact and rigid striker-plate impact. The plastic deformations and energy absorption of plate, energy dissipation of ice damage are investigated. Moreover, for these specific cases studied, an energy absorption reduction factor (EARF) of plate under ice impact compared to rigid striker impact is proposed to estimate the structural damage, which provide some useful information for the design of ship plate against ice impact. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
VYKC4J3P,The penetration resistance of the elliptical tip of torpedo anchors in cohesive soil,"Torpedo anchors are a new type of deep ocean anchor with a commonly elliptical anchor tip. However, little attention has been paid to theoretical research on the collapse load of the elliptical tip of the torpedo anchor. The lower and upper bound theorems are used to evaluate the penetration resistance of the anchor tip. A comparative analysis of the bearing capacity factor between the plastic limit solutions and the results presented in previous references is performed, and the feasibility of the lower and upper bound models is verified. As the aspect ratio of the anchor tip increases, the friction factor significantly affects the bearing capacity factor: the bearing capacity factor decreases with increasing the aspect ratio for smooth interface but increases with increasing the aspect ratio for the rough interface. Extended shape correction factors are obtained from the plane strain and axial symmetry results of the finite element method: 1.61 for a smooth interface, and 1.64 for a rough interface. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
SXVIY3U2,Comparative life cycle assessment of drinking straws in Brazil,"There have been numerous discussions about plastic drinking straws and their impacts on the natural environment, reflecting on public policies and companies????? operation, while alternatives to substituting plastic-based products have been proposed. However, making decisions without measuring trade-off conditions between the different scenarios may lead to higher impacts elsewhere on the life cycle or even in other areas of protection. To deepen this discussion, this paper aimed to quantify the potential environmental impacts of different drinking straws as well as find possible break-even situations. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to assess six different drinking straws (plastic, stainless steel, glass, paper, bamboo and jute) from cradle-to-grave. A hybrid life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method was applied following the characterization models recommended by ILCD. Sensitivity analyses included reuse rate, washing condition, the ancillary kits usage, End-of-Life (EoL) strategies and the inclusion of an indicator to account for the marine litter impacts from Life Cycle Inventory (LCI). Results showed that for baseline scenarios, plastic drinking straws have a better environmental performance if compared to reusable straws and has a favourable performance in 10 of 11 categories if compared to paper drinking straws. Water and detergent consumptions during the use phase and the manufacturing of additional elements (bag, brush) are the main drivers for this potentially higher environmental impact. Sensitivity analyses, however, showed that certain consumption patterns may lead to a break-even situation, especially when plastic drinking straws are disposed incorrectly into the natural ecosystem. Accounting for the impacts of marine litter may lead to a change in the decision-making depending on the significance (weight) attributed to the marine litter indicator. These outcomes reinforce the importance of understanding trade-offs during the entire life cycle of products and demonstrate that policies directed to product substitution should be carefully grounded. Recommendations on reusable straws rely on simplifying their ?????kits?????, expanding reuse rates and improving the washing process. For single use straws, waste collection and correct disposal are mandatory. The lack of a LCIA methodology to account for the environmental impact of mismanaged plastic waste on ecosystems, especially in the marine compartment represents an important issue to be further developed, from which, more realistic scenarios could be outlined for any product. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
QXIWKKIF,A comprehensive investigation of industrial plastic pellets on beaches across the Laurentian Great Lakes and the factors governing their distribution,"Industrial, pre-consumer pellets are a major type of plastics pollution found on shorelines worldwide. This study investigates the distribution and characteristics of plastic pellets accumulated on beaches of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America and provides a ?????snapshot????? of pellet distribution in a lake system that accounts for 21% of the world's freshwater reserves. We sampled pellets simultaneously from 10m2 quadrats on 66 beaches and characterized the 12,595 pellets collected (average of 19.1 pellets/m2). Forty-two beaches contained pellets and 86% of the pellets were found on three beaches: Rossport (Lake Superior), Baxter (Lake Huron), and Bronte (Lake Ontario). The number of pellets on each beach was compared with factors hypothesized to control their accumulation. In general, positive correlations were found between pellet abundance and watershed population, number of plastic-related industries, and proximity to a river mouth, although for Lake Superior, abundance was related to a train spill that took place over 10 years ago. Beach grain size appears to be related to pellet abundance, with very fine sand, fine sand and medium sand containing the greatest number of pellets. All pellets were visually characterized based on size, color, shape, weathering, and distinguishing traits. The predominant color was white, oblate shapes were most common, and the main distinguishing trait was a dimple. Most pellets showed little evidence of weathering, with the weathered samples mainly from Lakes Erie and Ontario. Lake Ontario pellets were the most varied, with 6/7 shapes, 35/40 colors, and 21/25 distinguishing traits, indicating a wider range of pellet sources compared to the other lakes. Polymer compositions were mainly polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). Our results will lead to increased recognition of regional pellet pollution in the Great Lakes watershed, thereby motivating change during their production, transport and use. ?? 2020",1
SZETX8NW,Biodegradable plastics: Prospects and application,"Polymers like plastics and rubbers are widely used all over the world in different spheres of life due to their attractive properties such as; low density, ability to resist corrosion, and excellent resistant to electricity conduction. However, the continuous use of these materials without a proper management of their wastes coupled with their low biodegradability has resulted in a huge environmental problem globally, as they accumulate both on land and in the ocean. Therefore, in the quest to solve this ecological crisis, there has been an immense interest and investments into biodegradable plastics otherwise known as bioplastics. ?? 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

53UL9FZM,Amphiphilic Marine Antifouling Coatings Based on a Hydrophilic Polyvinylpyrrolidone and Hydrophobic Fluorine-Silicon-Containing Block Copolymer,"The development of environmentally friendly and highly efficient antifouling coatings is vastly desirable in the marine industry. Herein, we prepared a novel amphiphilic block copolymer that combined hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with hydrophobic poly(1-(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyloxy)-3-(3,6,9-trioxadecyloxy)-propan-2-yl acrylate) (PFA) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The amphiphilic copolymer (PVP-PFA-PDMS) was blended into a cross-linked PDMS matrix to form a set of controlled surface composition and surface-renewal coatings with efficient antifouling and fouling-release properties. These coatings incorporated the biofouling settlement resistance ability attributed to the hydrophilic PVP segments and the reduced adhesion strength attributed to the low surface energy of fluorine-silicon-containing segments. As expected, the coatings showed an excellent antifouling performance against bacteria and marine unicellular Navicula parva diatoms (98.1 and 98.5% of reduction, respectively) and fouling-release performance against pseudobarnacle adhesion (84.3% of reduction) compared to the pristine PDMS coating. Moreover, a higher-content PVP-based coatings presented higher ability to resist biofouling adhesion. The nontoxic antifouling coating developed in this paper hold the potential to be applied in a variety of marine industrial facilities. ??",0
GAH3BPSF,Investigation of damages due to aqueous solution on GFRP laminated plates,"As these days increase in light weight composite materials with flexibility and long life but low in cost are highly in demand. These composite materials also need maximum strength and durability. GFRP is one of the best option in industries, because of rapid industrialization and modern development, everybody want robust and smart structure. GFRP is also known as fibreglass, made up of synthetic plastic and extremely fine fibres. And due to its large number of application and bulk properties like stiffness, flexibility, corrosion resistance etc., this composite material is more in demand other than other composite materials and also less expensive than other composite materials. GFRP plays very vital role in aviation industries, nowadays scientists are working on making light weight aircraft with composite materials. There are some of aircraft using GFRP materials are fuselage door, aileron, interior parts of aircraft, spoiler and elevator. Not only in aviation industry GFRP composite materials are also has high demand in industries like automotive, wind energy, defence, marine and construction etc. This research is to investigate the damages on GFRP composite materials due to Aqueous Substance. For this experiment GFRP Laminated Plates has been undergone a period of 30days observation, submerged into ATF(Aviation Turbine Fuel) and Salt Water. After completion of 30days of observation to determining the damages laminated plates were tested under quasi static bending test.

L7LPN5U4,Impact of upper mantle convection on lithosphere hyperextension and subsequent horizontally forced subduction initiation,"Many plate tectonic processes, such as subduction initiation, are embedded in long-term (> 100 Myr) geodynamic cycles often involving subsequent phases of extension, cooling without plate deformation and convergence. However, the impact of upper mantle convection on lithosphere dynamics during such long-term cycles is still poorly understood. We have designed two-dimensional upper-mantlescale (down to a depth of 660 km) thermo-mechanical numerical models of coupled lithosphere-mantle deformation. We consider visco-elasto-plastic deformation including a combination of diffusion, dislocation and Peierls creep law mechanisms. Mantle densities are calculated from petrological phase diagrams (Perple_X) for a Hawaiian pyrolite. Our models exhibit realistic Rayleigh numbers between 106 and 107, and the model temperature, density and viscosity structures agree with geological and geophysical data and observations. We tested the impact of the viscosity structure in the asthenosphere on upper mantle convection and lithosphere dynamics.We also compare models in which mantle convection is explicitly modelled with models in which convection is parameterized by Nusselt number scaling of the mantle thermal conductivity. Further, we quantified the plate driving forces necessary for subduction initiation in 2D thermomechanical models of coupled lithosphere-mantle deformation. Our model generates a 120 Myr long geodynamic cycle of subsequent extension (30 Myr), cooling (70 Myr) and convergence (20 Myr) coupled to upper mantle convection in a single and continuous simulation. Fundamental features such as the formation of hyperextended margins, upper mantle convective flow and subduction initiation are captured by the simulations presented here. Compared to a strong asthenosphere, a weak asthenosphere leads to the following differences: smaller value of plate driving forces necessary for subduction initiation (15TNm1 instead of 22 TNm1) and locally larger suction forces. The latter assists in establishing single-slab subduction rather than double-slab subduction. Subduction initiation is horizontally forced, occurs at the transition from the exhumed mantle to the hyperextended passive margin and is caused by thermal softening. Spontaneous subduction initiation due to negative buoyancy of the 400 km wide, cooled, exhumed mantle is not observed after 100 Myr in model history. Our models indicate that long-term lithosphere dynamics can be strongly impacted by sub-lithosphere dynamics. The first-order processes in the simulated geodynamic cycle are applicable to orogenies that resulted from the opening and closure of embryonic oceans bounded by magma-poor hyperextended rifted margins, which might have been the case for the Alpine orogeny. ??

VERGRMUM,Effects of microplastics and their adsorption of cadmium as vectors on the cladoceran Moina monogolica Daday: Implications for plastic-ingesting organisms,"As pervasive and resilient contaminants, microplastics (MPs) have potential to interact with the toxicity of metals through adsorption on the surface. In this study, we focused on 7-day adsorption of cadmium (5, 10 ??g/L) to aged polyethylene-MPs particles (300 ??g/L), and further examined 21-day chronic effects of MPs and MPs-Cd on cladoceran Moina monogolica Daday. The effects criteria selected were physiological changes (e.g., parental survival time, somatic growth and reproductive parameters) and nutritional profiles in offspring. Exposure of M. monogolica to both MPs and MPs-Cd can impair the development, reproductive output and fecundity across treatment groups, ultimately leading to parental mortality and poor nutritional status in progeny. Importantly, MPs with adsorbed Cd showed greater adverse dose-dependent effects than bare MPs, likely due to the mechanisms of physico-chemical interactions related to the Cd release from MPs-Cd inside organisms. MPs can pose not only a direct harm to the organisms but also an indirect hazard via adsorption as ?????transport vector?????, having implications for the function and resilience of aquatic ecosystems. Our findings experimentally highlight the importance of characterizing chemical profiling of contaminants adsorbed to field plastics in order to better assess environmentally relevant risks associated with MPs and metals in coastal areas. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
KJYATID8,"Microextraction based on microplastic followed by SERS for on-site detection of hydrophobic organic contaminants, an indicator of seawater pollution","Microplastics (MPs) have been proven to concentrate hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) from seawater as the sorbent phase, and the concentration of HOCs in aqueous solutions could be estimated from MPs preloaded with HOCs by equilibrium partition coefficient. This study firstly proposed to in situ quantify fluoranthene (a representative HOCs) pre-concentrated on MPs using surface enhance raman scattering (SERS) in combination with mathematical models, as an efficient monitoring tool for fluoranthene pollution in the aquatic environment. AgNPs-coated quartz (AgNPs@SiO2) substrate was fabricated. The SERS substrate was tested using fluoranthene standard solution with the minimal detectable concentration of 1 ng/mL achieved. Applying SERS for the detection of fluoranthene sorbed on MPs, the detection limit of fluoranthene on MPs was 3.3 ng/g, where the concentration in the corresponding equilibrium seawater was 0.97 ng/mL. Since more than one fluoranthene peak was observed, the quantitative detection was investigated by interval partial least square model. Eight characteristic peak ranges were selected to develop the model for predicting fluoranthene concentration, with R2c and R2v of 0.90 and 0.82, respectively. The study provides a promising solution to monitor trace level of contaminations in aquatic environment, using MPs as the passive sampler. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
KJENVHYV,Acute and chronic effects of polystyrene microplastics on brine shrimp: First evidence highlighting the molecular mechanism through transcriptome analysis,"Microplastics contamination is one of the leading environmental catastrophes for the marine ecosystem, but the molecular toxicity mechanism of those microplastics remains elusive. This study aims to determine the acute and chronic toxicity after exposure to polystyrene microplastics in brine shrimp with various concentrations. Our results demonstrated that acute exposure to polystyrene microplastics induced no significant effects on the survival of brine shrimp. Interestingly, the concentration-dependent increase in both bioaccumulation and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed after acute and chronic exposure. Moreover, the histopathology analysis revealed the deformation of epithelial cells in the midgut region after both acute exposures at 100 mg/L and chronic exposure at 1 mg/L to polystyrene microplastics. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of microplastics-mediated toxicity, the transcriptome analysis was performed after chronic exposure, and the result showed 721 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 156 known KEGG pathways. 292 DEGs genes were significantly upregulated and 429 genes were significantly downregulated. The transcriptome analysis further revealed the DEGs related pathways. Taken together, this study not only highlighted the negative effects but also provided detailed sequencing data from transcriptome profiling to enhance our understanding of the molecular toxicity of polystyrene microplastics in brine shrimp. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
NCDTPEHI,Evidence of Marine Microplastics in Commercially Harvested Seafood,"Microplastic pollution is a global issue that has a detrimental impact on food safety. In marine environments, microplastics are a threat to marine organisms, as they are often the same size range as prey and are mistaken as food. Consumption of microplastics has led to the damage of digestive organs and a reduction in growth and reproductive output. In this study, microplastic pollution was assessed across three commercially available shrimp species that were obtained from the supermarkets of Singapore. A total of 93 individuals were studied from the Pacific white leg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, the Argentine red shrimp Pleoticus muelleri and the Indian white shrimp Fenneropenaeus indicus. Microplastic fibers, fragments, film and spheres were identified from the digestive tract of these organisms. Microplastic abundance ranged from 13.4 to 7050 items. F. indicus exhibited the highest number of microplastics. Microplastic film was the most abundant in L. vannamei individuals (93?????97%) and spheres were the most abundant in P. muelleri (70%) and F. indicus (61%) individuals. This study demonstrates that microplastic contamination is evident in commonly consumed shrimp and highlights the role of shrimp in the trophic transfer and accumulation of microplastics in seafood. The consumption of microplastic-containing seafood is a route of exposure to humans and has implications on human health and food security. Capsule: Microplastics were examined in three shrimp species from the supermarkets of Singapore. Microplastics ranged from 13.4 to 7050 items of shrimp. ??

QM73CR29,Settling of inertial nonspherical particles in wavy flow,"Microplastics are an increasingly significant problem in the world's oceans. They are transported by various ocean phenomena, one of the most fundamental of which is surface gravity waves. Since microplastics are irregularly shaped and are not typically neutrally buoyant, understanding the settling of negatively buoyant, nonspherical plastic particles under surface gravity waves is important for accurately predicting the fate of microplastics in the ocean. Here we experimentally investigate the settling of plastic rods, disks, and spheres in wavy flows. We find that the average vertical velocities of the particles can both increase and decrease in waves, relative to the particle settling velocity in quiescent flow. This variation is a function of the flow inertia at the length scale of the particle, which we characterize with a particle Reynolds number, Rep, and is also a function of particle shape. We further examine the average vertical particle velocities by looking at two factors contributing to their behavior: The relative velocities between the particles and the flow and the manner in which the particles sample the flow. We find that the average relative velocities between the particles and the flow remain constant with Rep, even though the variation of the relative velocities of the rods with orientation increases with increasing Rep. The observed variation of the average vertical particle velocities with Rep can be explained instead by how the particles sample the flow, as each of the particle shapes nonuniformly sample the flow as a function of Rep. Accounting for the variation of particle settling velocities with shape and inertia in models is necessary to improve the accuracy of predictions of the transport of microplastics in the ocean. ?? 2020 American Physical Society.",0
KJ676ADL,Plasticizers as Microplastics Tracers in Tunisian Marine Environment,"The new knowledge on the bio-transformations to which the plastic material is subjected, raise concerns about their role as environmental contaminants. Microplastic have been reported to be responsible for the release and distribution of aquatic contaminants such organophosphorus esters, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalate esters. The occurrence, spatiotemporal trends, and ecological risk of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and non-phthalate plasticizers (NPPs) released from microplastic were investigated in water and fish (Sparus aurata) from five sites along the coast of Mahdia governorate (Tunisia), during April 2018-March 2019. In seawater the most abundant and frequently detected congeners were dibutyl phthalate (DBP, 0.017 mg L?????1 and 0.055 mg L?????1), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP, 0.075 mg L?????1 and 0.219 mg L?????1), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP, 0.071 mg L?????1 and 4.594 mg L?????1), and di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT, 0.634 mg L?????1 and 2.424 mg L?????1). (??PAEs: 1.416 mg L?????1 and 5.581 mg L?????1; ??NPPs: 9.191 mg L?????1 and 26.296 mg L?????1), confirming that such compounds bioconcentrate through the food chain. DBP (0.389 and 0.817 mg L?????1), DiBP (0.101 and 0.921 mg L?????1), DEHP (0.726 and 1.771 mg L?????1) and DEHT (9.191 and 23.251 mg L?????1) were predominant also in S. aurata affirming that such compounds bioconcentrate through the food chain. Overall, Tunisian samples i) were much more contaminated than counterparts previously investigated for the same pollutants from other world areas, and ii) revealed NPPs at higher levels than PAEs, confirming that such plasticizers are increasingly replacing conventional PAEs. ??

KH2NVFET,Handle with care?????microplastic particles in intestine samples of seals from German waters,"The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to reduce the marine debris burden in the marine environment by 2020. This requires an assessment of the actual situation, which includes the occurrence as well as the caused impacts. Information on both is scarce when it comes to top predators like marine mammals and the burden of microplastic. This is hampered by the limited access to free ranging marine mammals for collecting samples, as well as sample handling. The present study investigated gastrointestinal tracts and faecal samples of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) regularly occurring in the German North Sea and Baltic Sea with the aim of gaining information on the occurrence of microplastics. In total, 255 particles ???100 ??m (70 fibres, 185 fragments) were found in exemplary ten intestine and nine faecal samples. The findings ranged from zero fibres and six fragments, up to 35 fibres and 55 fragments per sample. Additionally, this study established a protocol for sample handling, microplastic isolation (???100 ??m) and quantification of gastrointestinal tracts and faecal samples of marine mammals with a low share of contamination. This approach helps to quantify the presence of microplastics in free-ranging marine mammals and is therefore applicable to assess the real burden of microplastic presence in the marine environment. ?? 2020 by the authors.

2DZGXZTW,"Microplastics quantification in surface waters of the Barents, Kara and White Seas","This study is focused on the analysis of microplastic concentrations in the surface waters of the White, Barents and Kara Seas. Sampling took place during the ?????Arctic Floating University 2018????? expedition using a manta trawl. Particularly high concentrations of the microplastics were found off the west coast of Novaya Zemlya archipelago with a maximum in a highly productive region ????? Gusinaya bank. The microplastic distribution pattern in the Barents Sea correlates both with the oceanic circulation and the fishing activities. The results show the first recorded estimation of microplastic concentrations in the White Sea with the higher concentrations located in the area affected by the Severnaya Dvina River discharge. Relatively low concentrations of microplastics were found in the Kara Sea. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
XHGN4PYX,Plastic litter pollution along sandy beaches in the Caribbean and Pacific coast of Colombia,"Plastic pollution is a global problem that poses a threat to coastal and marine ecosystems and human livelihoods and requires effective solutions adaptable to local conditions. In Colombia, the knowledge about marine plastic pollution is still limited and the development of effective strategies for managing marine and coastal environments is crucial. Therefore, plastic pollution was assessed on 43 Colombian sandy beaches on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. Amounts of macroplastic ranged from 35 ?? 15 to 81 ?? 23 items 100 m???1, being product's packaging the most common. Microplastic densities ranged from 3 to 1387 items m???2. The highest microplastic concentrations were found on the beaches from Caribbean cities and in rural areas of Pacific municipalities. Fragments and polyethylene were the most commonly observed shape and polymer categories, respectively. Tourism and poor waste management practices are the primary plastic sources on the studied beaches. Plastic litter on Colombian beaches are a problem that requires prevention, mitigation, and control actions to help conserve this ecosystem. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
E9KEVZ7Z,A near-synoptic survey of ocean microplastic concentration along an around-the-world sailing race,"Litter and plastic pollution in the marine environment is of major concern when considering the health of ocean ecosystems, and have become an important focus of ocean research during recent years. There is still significant uncertainty surrounding the distribution and impact of marine plastic litter on ocean ecosystems, and in particular on the nano- and microplastic fractions that are difficult to observe and may be harmful to marine organisms. Current estimates of ocean plastic concentrations only account for a small fraction of the approximated 8 million tons of plastic litter entering the oceans on an annual basis. Here, we present the distribution of 100?????500 ??m microplastic particles within the ocean mixed layer, covering a significant fraction of the ocean, in a near-synoptic survey. During The Ocean Race 2017/2018 edition (formerly known as Volvo Ocean Race), two yachts served as ships of opportunity that regularly took samples of microplastics on a regular schedule during their circumnavigation. This effort resulted in information on microplastic distribution along the race track in the ocean?????s upper, well-mixed, layer. We found concentrations ranging from 0?????349 particles per cubic meter, but with large spatial variability. There was a tendency toward higher concentrations off south-western Europe and in the southwest Pacific, and indications of long-range transport of microplastic with major ocean currents. ?? 2020 Tanhua et al.

L698IN9Z,Sandy beaches as hotspots of bisphenol A,"Bisphenol A (BPA) poses a serious environmental threat and health concern. This study presents the global monitoring of BPA on oceanic sandy beaches. According to monitoring results, many beach sands contain a harmful concentrations of BPA. Likewise, styrene oligomers (SOs), anthropogenic chemicals derived from polystyrene plastics, show similar concentrations as BPA. This study shows a strong, positive correlation between BPA and SOs. The results indicate that probably BPA-containing materials including micro- and nano-plastics can be an important source of BPA to the sand beaches. Therefore, BPA presents potential health risks to people spending considerable time on the beach. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",0
R2Y3S6AU,Ocean acidification alters bacterial communities on marine plastic debris,"The increasing quantity of plastic waste in the ocean is providing a growing and more widespread novel habitat for microbes. Plastics have taxonomically distinct microbial communities (termed the ?????Plastisphere?????) and can raft these unique communities over great distances. In order to understand the Plastisphere properly it will be important to work out how major ocean changes (such as warming, acidification and deoxygenation) are shaping microbial communities on waste plastics in marine environments. Here, we show that common plastic drinking bottles rapidly become colonised by novel biofilm-forming bacterial communities, and that ocean acidification greatly influences the composition of plastic biofilm assemblages. We highlight the potential implications of this community shift in a coastal community exposed to enriched CO2 conditions. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
PPLU542T,The global biological microplastic particle sink,"Every year, about four percent of the plastic waste generated worldwide ends up in the ocean. What happens to the plastic there is poorly understood, though a growing body of evidence suggests it is rapidly spreading throughout the global ocean. The mechanisms of this spread are straightforward for buoyant larger plastics that can be accurately modelled using Lagrangian particle models. But the fate of the smallest size fractions (the microplastics) are less straightforward, in part because they can aggregate in sinking marine snow and faecal pellets. This biologically-mediated pathway is suspected to be a primary surface microplastic removal mechanism, but exactly how it might work in the real ocean is unknown. We search the parameter space of a new microplastic model embedded in an earth system model to show that biological uptake can significantly shape global microplastic inventory and distributions and even account for the budgetary ?????missing????? fraction of surface microplastic, despite being an inefficient removal mechanism. While a lack of observational data hampers our ability to choose a set of ?????best????? model parameters, our effort represents a first tool for quantitatively assessing hypotheses for microplastic interaction with ocean biology at the global scale. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",0
XA6TF3JQ,Plastics in surface water of southern coastal belt of Sri Lanka (Northern Indian Ocean): Distribution and characterization by FTIR,"This study focused on investigating the occurrence, quantification, and the spatial and temporal distribution of plastics in coastal surface water from 12 coastal regions in southern part of Sri Lanka. The overall average densities of macroplastics and mesoplastics were recorded as 0.23 and 0.33 items/m3, respectively. Sampling locations had no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) on total microplastics (MPs) density (overall mean MPs density: 17.45 ?? 3.35 items/m3). MPs debris of less than 1 mm size consisted of &gt;45% of the total number of MPs, whereas the maximum size of microscopically observed plastic debris was 11.04 mm, a filament. Filaments were the most common MPs followed by films. Relatively, blue-colored MPs were highly abundant in this coastal line. The type of MPs was further confirmed by Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) method. Potential plastic pollution factors are hydrodynamics and man-made activities like unsustainable harbor operations, fisheries, and tourism. More attention is needed to reduce plastic pollution regionally. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
XWYNGG9B,Ingestion of plastic debris by commercially important marine fish in southeast-south Brazil,"Rising concentrations of plastics in the oceans are leading to increasing negative interactions with marine biota, including ingestion by endangered and/or economically important seafood species such as fish. In this paper, we visually evaluated plastic debris ingestion by 965 specimens of eight commercially exploited fish species from different marine habitats off the southeast-south coast of Brazil. All species ingested plastics, with pelagic animals having higher amounts, frequency of occurrence, diversity and sizes of ingested items than demersal-pelagic and demersal animals. Highest frequency of occurrence (FO%) of plastic ingestion (25.8%) was observed for the pelagic skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis (Scombridae), and lowest (5%) for the demersal bluewing searobin Prionotus punctatus (Triglidae). Microplastics predominated in all species, and fibers/lines and fragments were the main items found, possibly derived from fishing materials. The most abundant plastic colors were transparent, black and blue, and the most common polymers were polyamide and polyurethane. With the available data, no relationship between the size of the individuals and amount of ingested plastics was observed. Considering the negative impacts of plastic ingestion on marine fish, and potentially on human health due to their consumption, understanding ingestion patterns is critical for better evaluating their origin and possible causes, and consequently for helping define prevention strategies for this problem. ?? 2020 Eight exploited marine fish species in Brazil were shown to ingest plastics. Fish ate mainly transparent, black and blue microplastics made of PA and PU. ?? 2020",0
2HVLG2RY,Microplastics in sea ice and seawater beneath ice floes from the Arctic Ocean,"Within the past decade, an alarm was raised about microplastics in the remote and seemingly pristine Arctic Ocean. To gain further insight about the issue, microplastic abundance, distribution and composition in sea ice cores (n = 25) and waters underlying ice floes (n = 22) were assessed in the Arctic Central Basin (ACB). Potential microplastics were visually isolated and subsequently analysed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy. Microplastic abundance in surface waters underlying ice floes (0?????18 particles m???3) were orders of magnitude lower than microplastic concentrations in sea ice cores (2?????17 particles L???1). No consistent pattern was apparent in the vertical distribution of microplastics within sea ice cores. Backward drift trajectories estimated that cores possibly originated from the Siberian shelves, western Arctic and central Arctic. Knowledge about microplastics in environmental compartments of the Arctic Ocean is important in assessing the potential threats posed by microplastics to polar organisms. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",1
Y7VUDU4N,Tackling marine plastic pollution through source-to-sea approach and circular economy,"Marine litter and associated marine pollution are becoming a complex global environmental hazard these days. Among the different faces of marine pollution, by far the largest and probably the most dangerous part is marine plastic litter. Plastic litter can be found in almost every marine environment in the world, including deep ocean beds and frozen polar ice. Unless new sustainable methods of plastic production and waste management are encouraged, marine plastic pollution will continue to pose a severe threat to the natural ecosystems of the world. In this paper, the status of marine plastic litter is reviewed using a DPSIR framework, and it is found that significant changes in the way we live and consume are needed to prevent it. A framework that combines the source-to-sea approach and circular economy is introduced as a possible solution to eliminate plastic waste from the environment as well as from the economy. ?? 2020 Technoscience Publications.

BGDWEIZ4,"Riverine microplastics: Behaviour, spatio-temporal variability, and recommendations for standardised sampling and monitoring","Microplastics (synthetic polymer particles <5 mm in size) are currently of major research interest due to their ubiquity and persistence in the environment, as well as their alleged adverse impact on aquatic biota. Although most research to date has targeted microplastic pollution within the marine environment, riverine pathways deliver up to 80 % of plastic debris into the seas and oceans. The transfer mechanisms of microplastics through river systems, however, remain largely understudied. A number of authors have attempted to assess the fate of plastic particles in river systems, often reporting contrasting findings. This is mainly due to the heterogeneity of river systems combined with a lack of standardisation between the sampling protocols adopted. Here, we summarise the current state of knowledge on the riverine transport pathways of plastic debris and examine the typical spatio-temporal patterns in microplastic occurrence in river waters and sediments. Furthermore, we critically evaluate the commonly used sampling techniques and provide guidelines for unified field study design. Lastly, we identify issues that warrant further research and propose recommendations for future studies to improve our understanding of microplastics in the riverine environment. Standardisation of sampling methods will be vital for the development of a more reliable microplastic monitoring strategy and, on a longer timescale, the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures. ?? 2020",0
AWCKSZLA,The long-term legacy of plastic mass production,"Mismanaged plastic waste is transported via rivers or city drains into the ocean where it accumulates in coastal sediments, ocean gyres and the deep ocean. Plastic harms marine biota and may ultimately return to humans via the food chain. Private initiatives proposing to collect plastic from the sea and rivers have gained widespread attention, especially in the media. However, few of these methods are proven concepts and it remains unclear how effective they are. Here we estimate the amount of plastic in the global surface ocean to assess the long-term legacy of plastic mass production, calculate the time required to clean up the oceans with river barriers and clean up devices, and explore the fate of collected plastic waste. We find that the projected impact of both single and multiple clean up devices is very modest. A significant reduction of plastic debris in the ocean can be only achieved with collection at rivers or with a combination of river barriers and clean up devices. We also show that the incineration and production of plastic has a significant long-term effect on the global atmospheric carbon budget. We conclude that a combination of reduced plastic emissions and reinforced collection is the only way to rid the ocean of plastic waste. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
C8SI8BF4,Microplastic pollution profile of Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected along the Turkish coasts,"Plastics profoundly threatens ecological balance in marine ecosystems across the globe in the current era of industrialization. Microplastics (MP), in particular, can pose risks reaching humans through the food web via various marine organisms. Among these organisms, since they are consumed as a whole, mussels are vital vectors of MP transfer during human consumption. Hence, here we analyzed MP pollution in Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) sampled from 23 different locations all along the Turkish coasts of the Black Sea, Sea of Marmara, and the Aegean Sea. After digestion of the mussels with H2O2, the micro-particles were determined under a stereomicroscope and characterized by confirming with FTIR analyses. 48% of the sampled mussels were found to have MPs. The average MP abundance was 0.69 item/mussel and 0.23 item/g fresh weight (fw) of soft tissue. Morphology was ordered as follows: fragments (67.6%)&gt; fibers (28.4%)&gt; films (4.05%). The dominant size of MPs was detected less than 0.5 mm (26.58%). 12 different polymers have been identified by FTIR and PET (32.9%), PP (28.4%), and PE (19.4%) were found to constitute 80% of the total MPs. The annual average exposure amount for mussel consumers in Turkey was estimated as 1918 MPs item/per year. Even though international organizations such as FAO, JECFA, or EU have not declared permissible limits, our data may inform human health uptake of MP ingestion via mussels. This data might also serve as a reference data-set for further MP monitoring research in Turkish and European Seas. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
R5XMQV6Z,Transport and characterization of microplastics in inland waterways,"Microplastic pollution in floodplains and river channels in 14 locations at six sites along three rivers in Virginia was measured to test the hypotheses that microplastics concentrate in floodplains, exist as larger aggregates with other natural and synthetic particles, and may be different than ocean microplastics. The results show that (1) microplastic concentrations were generally just as high or higher in the floodplain than in the stream channel, (2) microplastics aggregated with natural sediment particles into the ?????heteroaggregates????? predicted theoretically, (3) microplastics were larger in the floodplain than in the stream channel with a wider particle size distribution, (4) microplastic particles were 80 % fragments, 15 % spherical particles, and 5% fibers, and (5) chemically identified microplastics were composed of common packaging plastics that were heavily oxidized or hydrolyzed. The shape and chemical compositions of microplastic particles found was very similar to those observed in and around other rivers studied in the literature but different from the ocean environment. The floodplain could be used to capture river microplastics. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
5GCNAF4A,Extensive use of face masks during COVID-19 pandemic: (micro-)plastic pollution and potential health concerns in the Arabian Peninsula,"Face masks are primary line of defense to reduce the transmission risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). World Health Organization (WHO) has already updated the guidelines and advised the use of face masks in public areas essentially. This has dramatically increased the production and use of face masks in many parts of the world. Arabian Peninsula is comprised of six countries where the public perception of following WHO guidelines is high. In this study, we highlight the concerns relating to extensive use of face masks in this region, particularly in the context of (micro-)plastic pollution. We computed the number of face masks to be used in each of the countries of Arabian Peninsula for varying levels of acceptance rate and average number of daily usages. Accordingly, the amount of (micro-)plastic that could come into the terrestrial and marine environment is also reported. Saudi Arabia, being the most populated country in the region may contribute up to 32?????235 thousand tons of (micro-)plastic which is nearly half of the amount in the whole Peninsula. On the other hand, an extremely high infection rate in Qatar (25.74%) may also lead to a significant increase of (micro-)plastic content due to high public acceptance rate and living standards. The high (micro-)plastic fraction is of significant concern because it ends up in the marine ecosystems. Further, it allows colonization of several pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungal filaments, and spores) and might serve as carriers of disease transmission finally affecting the living organisms habituating these ecosystems. It is suggested that appropriate regulations on face masks waste should be devised to avoid any unwanted consequences in the near future. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
FYMBI5HG,Ranking environmental degradation trends of plastic marine debris based on physical properties and molecular structure,"As plastic marine debris continues to accumulate in the oceans, many important questions surround this global dilemma. In particular, how many descriptors would be necessary to model the degradation behavior of ocean plastics or understand if degradation is possible? Here, we report a data-driven approach to elucidate degradation trends of plastic debris by linking abiotic and biotic degradation behavior in seawater with physical properties and molecular structures. The results reveal a hierarchy of predictors to quantify surface erosion as well as combinations of features, like glass transition temperature and hydrophobicity, to classify ocean plastics into fast, medium, and slow degradation categories. Furthermore, to account for weathering and environmental factors, two equations model the influence of seawater temperature and mechanical forces. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",0
K6PKXMB4,Atmospheric transport is a major pathway of microplastics to remote regions,"In recent years, marine, freshwater and terrestrial pollution with microplastics has been discussed extensively, whereas atmospheric microplastic transport has been largely overlooked. Here, we present global simulations of atmospheric transport of microplastic particles produced by road traffic (TWPs ????? tire wear particles and BWPs ????? brake wear particles), a major source that can be quantified relatively well. We find a high transport efficiencies of these particles to remote regions. About 34% of the emitted coarse TWPs and 30% of the emitted coarse BWPs (100 kt yr???1 and 40 kt yr???1 respectively) were deposited in the World Ocean. These amounts are of similar magnitude as the total estimated direct and riverine transport of TWPs and fibres to the ocean (64 kt yr???1). We suggest that the Arctic may be a particularly sensitive receptor region, where the light-absorbing properties of TWPs and BWPs may also cause accelerated warming and melting of the cryosphere. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",0
C5NA2YJW,"Plastic density as a key factor in the presence of microplastic in the gastrointestinal tract of commercial fishes from Campeche Bay, Mexico","Microplastics (MPs) are currently one of the primary marine pollution problems around the world. MPs are distributed throughout the water column, dependent mainly on the density that is given by the polymer type, as well as the location, depth, and velocities of the water flows. This situation allows all aquatic organisms to be exposed to MPs. Furthermore, toxic substances can adhere to the MPs, making the consumption of fish with MPs a risk to human health. The aim of this study was to evaluate and characterize the microplastics present in the gastrointestinal tract of six species of fish which had the highest human consumption in Campeche, Mexico and their relationship with the density of MPs founded. A total of 316 microplastic particles from 240 individuals were found with 1.31 ?? 2.59 of microplastics per fish. The results indicate that there are differences (KW?????H = 53.14) between the densities of the MPs present in demersal fish (1.41 ?? 0.4 g cm???3) with respect to the pelagic species (1.04 ?? 0.24 g cm???3). Likewise, differences were found between fibers, fragments, and pellets present in the studied fish with a pelagic: demersal ratio of 1: 2.4 for all microplastics. The demersal species Haemulon plumierii (n = 40) presented the highest number of MPs with 115 items in total, 73 fibers, and 42 fragments. The results of this research show the first evidence that the density of the material from which microplastics are made play a key role determining their fate in marine fish habitats. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
PXXNSIZU,Potential toxicity of polystyrene microplastic particles,"Environmental pollution arising from plastic waste is a major global concern. Plastic macroparticles, microparticles, and nanoparticles have the potential to affect marine ecosystems and human health. It is generally accepted that microplastic particles are not harmful or at best minimal to human health. However direct contact with microplastic particles may have possible adverse effect in cellular level. Primary polystyrene (PS) particles were the focus of this study, and we investigated the potential impacts of these microplastics on human health at the cellular level. We determined that PS particles were potential immune stimulants that induced cytokine and chemokine production in a size-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",0
VRXS2Z7A,"Microplastic occurrence in marine invertebrates sampled from Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa in different seasons","The occurrence of microplastics in the environment, together with increasing temperatures as a result of climate change, has become a global concern. However, few reports are available on microplastic ingestion in lower benthic marine animals sampled from their natural environment during different seasons of the year. This study investigated microplastic uptake in Dotilla fenestrata (Hilgendorf 1869), Holothuria cinerascens (Brandt 1835) and Pyura stolonifera (Heller 1878) sampled from their natural environment during winter and summer. Animals sampled were cleaned of sand and attached animals and transported on ice to the laboratory. D. fenestrata, H. cinerascens (guts), and P. stolonifera (soft tissues) were digested in 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution for 24 hours at 60??C and analysed for microplastics. The per cent occurrences of microplastics found in sampled animals were more than 95 % in both seasons, and fibres were the most predominant microplastic types found. Season significantly affect microplastic uptake in Dotilla fenestrata (t-test: t-value = 2.915, df = 58, p = 0.01) while it had no effect in H. cinerascens and P. stolonifera sampled. A significantly higher number of microplastics were found in D. fenestrata than H. cinerascens (ANOVA HSD: df = 2, p = 008) and P. stolonifera (ANOVA HSD: df = 2, p = 000) in winter while H. cinerascens had a higher number of microplastics than P. stolonifera in summer (ANOVA HSD: df = 2, p = 002). These results show that microplastic uptake in some ectotherms may be season-dependent and that feeding method impacts the accessibility of marine invertebrates to microplastics in their environment. ?? 2020 Technoscience Publications.

QELRHT5X,Spatial and temporal variations of coastal microplastic pollution in Hong Kong,"Further to our 2015?????16 investigation, this study revealed the repeated presence of microplastics (MPs) in the coastal environment (Deep Bay, Tolo Harbour, Tsing Yi and Victoria Harbour) of Hong Kong from July 2016 to March 2017. The highest level of MPs in coastal surface water (17,182 particles/100 m3) was detected in Tsing Yi. Microplastic abundance in sediments of different sites (59 to 225 plastic particles/kg), however, did not vary significantly. MPs in the size of ???1 mm were predominated in surface waters (53.3% to 98.6%) and sediments (79.1% to 96.8%). MPs in the shape of pellets and fragments were prevalent in surface waters and sediments respectively. Seasonal pattern of microplastic pollution was consistently observed in Victoria Harbour and Tsing Yi, where the number of MPs was always higher in dry season than in wet season for two consecutive years. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
Y556TPNK,An intelligent way for discerning plastics at the shorelines and the seas,"Irrespective of how plastics litter the coastline or enter the sea, they pose a major threat to birds and marine life alike. In this study, an artificial intelligence tool was used to create an image classifier based on a convolutional neural network architecture that utilises the bottleneck method. The trained bottleneck method classifier was able to categorise plastics encountered either at the shoreline or floating at the sea surface into eight distinct classes, namely, plastic bags, bottles, buckets, food wrappings, straws, derelict nets, fish, and other objects. Discerning objects with a success rate of 90%, the proposed deep learning approach constitutes a leap towards the smart identification of plastics at the coastline and the sea. Training and testing loss and accuracy results for a range of epochs and batch sizes have lent credibility to the proposed method. Results originating from a resolution sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the prediction technique retains its ability to correctly identify plastics even when image resolution was downsized by 75%. Intelligent tools, such as the one suggested here, can replace manual sorting of macroplastics from human operators revealing, for the first time, the true scale of the amount of plastic polluting our beaches and the seas. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",0
3BSDBCZC,Identification of tidal trapping of microplastics in a temperate salt marsh system using sea surface microlayer sampling,"Microplastics are contaminants of increasing global environmental concern. Estuaries are a major transport pathway for land-derived plastics to the open ocean but are relatively understudied compared to coastal and open marine environments. The role of the ?????estuarine filter?????, by which the supply of sediments and contaminants to the sea is moderated by processes including vegetative trapping and particle flocculation, remains poorly defined for microplastics land to sea transfer. Here, we focus on the sea surface microlayer (SML) as a vector for microplastics, and use SML sampling to assess microplastic trapping in a temperate marsh system in Southampton Water, UK. The SML is known to concentrate microplastics relative to the underlying water and is the first part of rising tidal waters to traverse intertidal and upper tidal surfaces. Sampling a salt marsh creek at high temporal resolution allowed assessment of microplastics in-wash and outflow from the salt marsh, and its relationship with tidal state and bulk suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), over spring and neap tides. A statistically significant decrease in microplastics abundance from the flood tide to the ebb tide was found, and a weak positive relationship with SSC observed. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",1
GDTTBLIT,High concentrations of plastic hidden beneath the surface of the Atlantic Ocean,"Concern over plastic pollution of the marine environment is severe. The mass-imbalance between the plastic litter supplied to and observed in the ocean currently suggests a missing sink. However, here we show that the ocean interior conceals high loads of small-sized plastic debris which can balance and even exceed the estimated plastic inputs into the ocean since 1950. The combined mass of just the three most-littered plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene) of 32?????651 ??m size-class suspended in the top 200 m of the Atlantic Ocean is 11.6?????21.1 Million Tonnes. Considering that plastics of other sizes and polymer types will be found in the deeper ocean and in the sediments, our results indicate that both inputs and stocks of ocean plastics are much higher than determined previously. It is thus critical to assess these terms across all size categories and polymer groups to determine the fate and danger of plastic contamination. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",1
CCBC53MS,The current state of marine debris on the seafloor in offshore area around Japan,"Marine debris on the seafloor has not been thoroughly investigated, and there is little information compared to other types of marine debris. We conducted bottom trawl surveys to determine the present situation of marine debris on the seafloor in offshore areas around Japan. The survey was conducted in three sea areas with different characteristics. As a result, it was found that the amount of marine debris in submarine canyons (2926.1 items/km2) was higher than on the continental shelf. It was revealed that most marine debris on the seafloor is comprised of plastic products, and that debris on the seafloor retains its condition for a long time (over 30 years) without deterioration. In addition, the type of marine debris is affected by the industries operating in each area. Continuing to investigate marine debris on the seafloor in more areas will contribute to solving the problem of marine debris. ?? 2020 The Authors",1
9MR8SRXX,Effects of distance to the sea and geomorphological characteristics on the quantity and distribution of microplastics in beach sediments of Granada (Spain),"Microplastics became an unprecedented challenge and mapping their contamination all over the world is needed in order to establish baseline levels and identify the polymers in order to enhance adequate legislation and policy. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the existence of microplastic pollution on three beaches on the coast of Granada (Spain), namely La Herradura, Motril Beach and La R??bita, characterizing the particles and the relationships in their distribution. This may contribute supporting the studies carried out at a national level in accordance with the Directive on Marine Strategy (2008/56/EC). The results showed a greater median concentration of particles/kg of dry sediment in La Herradura (45.0 ?? 24.7) than in Motril (31.5 ?? 21.5) and La R??bita (22.0 ?? 23.2). These data revealed a higher contamination by microplastics in an enclosed bay-type beach (La Herradura) in comparison with open delta-type beaches. The predominant morphologies were microspheres and fragments, with maximum median concentrations of 38.0 ?? 23.7 and 6.0 ?? 0.7 particles/kg, respectively. The distribution and size of the particles is affected by the geomorphological and sedimentary characteristics of these beaches, which are different from any other in Spain and in the Mediterranean in general. The beaches of Granada showed more microplastic contamination than Greek or Slovenian beaches, but less than other Spanish beaches. In this area of the Mediterranean, the presence of microplastics can be affected by the wind, sea currents or methodological aspects such as the pore size of the filters used. All of these factors were analysed when comparing the beaches of Granada with other Mediterranean beaches. This study shows that there is contamination by microplastics on the beaches of Granada, which have been little explored until now due to the difficult geological and granulometric characteristics, and gives support to other national studies. ?? 2020",1
LHU5RZBK,Intergenerational microplastics impact the intertidal barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite during the planktonic larval and benthic adult stages,"Microplastics have size-dependent intergenerational impacts that significantly increase second generation mortality. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Microplastic exposure in one generation of marine organism is believed to impact future generations; the nature of this impact, however, remains unclear, especially across different life stages. We investigated within-generational, latent, and intergenerational effects of various sizes (1.7, 6.8, 10.4, and 19.0 ??m) and concentrations (1, 10, 100, and 1000 beads mL???1) of polystyrene microplastics on the planktonic larval and benthic adult life stages of the intertidal barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite. We exposed parents to microplastics during different developmental stages and examined the life history traits of their offspring. Microplastics had prominent intergenerational?????but no within-generational?????effects. Parental exposure to 1.7, 6.8, and 10.4 ??m microplastics from the larvae to adults significantly increased offspring larval mortality. 1.7 and 6.8 ??m microplastics at 1000 beads mL???1 delayed larval development in offspring. Intergenerational effects were observed when microplastics were exposed to parent larvae, suggesting that parental experiences during sensitive early-life stages can have profound impacts across generations. Adverse intergenerational effects of microplastics might drastically reduce larval recruitment and threaten long-term zooplankton sustainability. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
IJ8XVYY4,Microplastics affect sedimentary microbial communities and nitrogen cycling,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in estuarine, coastal, and deep sea sediments. The impacts of microplastics on sedimentary microbial ecosystems and biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles, however, have not been well reported. To evaluate if microplastics influence the composition and function of sedimentary microbial communities, we conducted a microcosm experiment using salt marsh sediment amended with polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane foam (PUF) or polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics. We report that the presence of microplastics alters sediment microbial community composition and nitrogen cycling processes. Compared to control sediments without microplastic, PUF- and PLA-amended sediments promote nitrification and denitrification, while PVC amendment inhibits both processes. These results indicate that nitrogen cycling processes in sediments can be significantly affected by different microplastics, which may serve as organic carbon substrates for microbial communities. Considering this evidence and increasing microplastic pollution, the impact of plastics on global ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling merits critical investigation. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",0
53TUGVS6,"Public attitudes towards microplastics: Perceptions, behaviors and policy implications","Microplastics are ubiquitous and have been found in marine environments, organisms, salt, and even human bodies. Concern about the impact of microplastics on the ecological environment, as well as the threat of microplastics to food safety and public health is increasing among the society. However, there is currently no effective technical way to tackle and remove microplastics from the environment. Thus, public attitudes are key to reducing microplastic emissions. This study investigated the public's perceptions and attitudes towards microplastics in Shanghai and used an ordered regression model to explore the public's willingness to reduce microplastics and its influencing factors. We used random face-to-face interviews to complete a total of 437 valid questionnaires. The survey results show that only 26% of the respondents had heard of microplastics before the survey, and the majority were relatively unfamiliar with microplastics. Although the public's awareness of microplastics is low compared to that of other substances, when informed with the possibility that microplastics may affect human health, 75% of respondents became worried or even overly worried. In addition, the higher the respondents' knowledge of plastics and microplastics is, the stronger their willingness to behave. Public's concern is also an important impact factor. We found that women's willingness to reduce emissions is higher than men's and environmental protection-related practitioners are also more willing to act. Therefore, this article focuses on the public's understanding of microplastics to propose measures and policy implications to reduce microplastic emissions during the process of microplastic production and recycling. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0
9EHGXIF8,Coping with the ?????dirt?????: brown shrimp and the microplastic threat,"Microplastic pollution is an emerging threat to marine biota. Uptake of microplastics can impair nutrition and affect the performance of organisms. However, the vulnerability to microplastics seems to vary between species for yet widely unexplored reasons. We investigated the stomach content of the brown shrimp, Crangon crangon, from the southern North Sea and performed feeding experiments and anatomical studies of the digestive organs to comprehend the distribution of fluorescent microparticles within the shrimp. Shrimp collected in their natural environment contained between 51 and more than 3,000 sand grains and fragments of bivalve shells in their stomachs. Sand grains may have been ingested to exploit the associated biofilm or to support maceration of food. Bivalve shell fragments were particularly abundant in summer when shrimp fed on freshly settled mussels. Shrimps????? stomach can be cleaned from ingested particles by regurgitation. In an experimental approach, we administered fluorescent microbeads of 0.1, 2.1, and 9.9 ??m diameter. Only the smallest particles (0.1 ??m) entered the midgut gland, which is the principal site of nutrient resorption in crustaceans. A fine-meshed chitinous filter system in the stomach of the shrimp prevents the passage of particles larger than about 1 ??m. C. crangon appears well adapted to handle natural microscopic particles. This trait might also be advantageous in coping with microplastic pollution. ?? 2020 The Authors",0
QARKV7J8,"Citizen science reveals microplastic hotspots within tidal estuaries and the remote Scilly Islands, United Kingdom","The identification of microplastic hotspots is vital to our long-term understanding of their environmental fate and distribution. Although case studies have increased globally, sampling campaigns are often restricted geographically, with poor spatial resolution. Here, we use citizen science to increase our geographical reach, which improved our understanding of microplastic distribution in estuarine and beach sediment along the south-west coast of England. Hotspots (>700 particles per kg dry sediment) were identified on the Scilly Islands and in close proximity to major metropolitan hubs (i.e. Falmouth and Plymouth). Particles extracted from the Scilly Island sites were composed of polyethylene and polypropylene. With low population density on the Isle of Scilly, hotspots may suggest that microplastics originate from distant sources, while Falmouth and Plymouth, on mainland UK, are locally supplied. This information supports the design of future campaigns and targeted mitigation strategies in areas of highest concentrations. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",1
2455TX2K,"Invasive or not? The case of Grateloupia turuturu (Rhodophyta, Halymeniales) in the Northern Ionian Sea (Mediterranean Sea)","It has been predicted that Grateloupia turuturu, native of the cold-temperate waters of Japan, is one of the most invasive marine species considered as a threat to global marine biodiversity. However, few studies have been carried out to assess the extent of its spread worldwide. Its seasonal dynamics in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto, a transitional water system in the Northern Ionian Sea, were observed for ten years. Systematic monthly observations were carried out from 2008 to 2018. The length of thalli and density were measured alongside the seawater temperature. Data were processed by means of non-parametric statistical analyses. No invasive behavior was detected for G. turuturu. It seems well established in the Mar Piccolo even though its population is limited to the station of first detection. However, due to its shown preference for plastic substrate, it could become a vector of another urgent threat, that is plastic pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0
HNZMSMD3,The deep sea is a major sink for microplastic debris,"Marine debris, mostly consisting of plastic, is a global problem, negatively impacting wildlife, tourism and shipping. However, despite the durability of plastic, and the exponential increase in its production, monitoring data show limited evidence of concomitant increasing concentrations in marine habitats. There appears to be a considerable proportion of the manufactured plastic that is unaccounted for in surveys tracking the fate of environmental plastics. Even the discovery of widespread accumulation of microscopic fragments (microplastics) in oceanic gyres and shallow water sediments is unable to explain the missing fraction. Here, we show that deep-sea sediments are a likely sink for microplastics. Microplastic, in the form of fibres, was up to four orders of magnitude more abundant (per unit volume) in deep-sea sediments from the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean than in contaminated sea-surface waters. Our results show evidence for a large and hitherto unknown repository of microplastics. The dominance of microfibres points to a previously underreported and unsampled plastic fraction. Given the vastness of the deep sea and the prevalence of microplastics at all sites we investigated, the deep-sea floor appears to provide an answer to the question??where is all the plastic?",1
V92IZEXN,Assessment of marine debris on the Belgian Continental Shelf,"A comprehensive assessment of marine litter in three environmental compartments of Belgian coastal waters was performed. Abundance, weight and composition of marine debris, including microplastics, was assessed by performing beach, sea surface and seafloor monitoring campaigns during two consecutive years. Plastic items were the dominant type of macrodebris recorded: over 95% of debris present in the three sampled marine compartments were plastic. In general, concentrations of macrodebris were quite high. Especially the number of beached debris reached very high levels: on average 6429??6767 items per 100m were recorded. Microplastic concentrations were determined to assess overall abundance in the different marine compartments of the Belgian Continental Shelf. In terms of weight, macrodebris still dominates the pollution of beaches, but in the water column and in the seafloor microplastics appear to be of higher importance: here, microplastic weight is approximately 100 times and 400 times higher, respectively, than macrodebris weight.",1
A79Z9QL3,Microplastic pollution in deep-sea sediments,"Microplastics are small plastic particles (<1??mm) originating from the degradation of larger plastic debris. These microplastics have been accumulating in the marine environment for decades and have been detected throughout the water column and in sublittoral and beach sediments worldwide. However, up to now, it has never been established whether microplastic presence in sediments is limited to accumulation hot spots such as the continental shelf, or whether they are also present in deep-sea sediments. Here we show, for the first time ever, that microplastics have indeed reached the most remote of marine environments: the deep sea. We found plastic particles sized in the micrometre range in deep-sea sediments collected at four locations representing different deep-sea habitats ranging in depth from 1100 to 5000??m. Our results demonstrate that microplastic pollution has spread throughout the world's seas and oceans, into the remote and largely unknown deep sea.",1
BAE8DP3I,The distribution of microplastics in the surface layer of the Atlantic Ocean from the subtropics to the equator according to visual analysis,"This study reports the levels of plastic contamination in the Atlantic Ocean between 35??N and 32??S during the 1st stage of the 79th cruise of the ??Akademik Mstislav Keldysh?? from December 12, 2019, to January 4, 2020. A subsurface pump system and a Manta net were used for seawater filtration. Twenty-seven samples were visually analyzed with a microscope. It was found that almost every subsurface sample contained potentially plastic particles, which were classified according to their type and size. Plastic fragments were more commonly found in the samples taken from the surface. In the subsurface layer, the majority of the detected particles were fibers. These results also indicate that minimal concentrations of plastics tend to be found near the equator and to the north of the Canary Islands. The maximum microplastic concentrations were found in tropical zones. The obtained results are in good agreement with previous models and field studies.",1
ARIK9HCR,Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in fish tissue may be an indicator of plastic contamination in marine habitats,"The accumulation of plastic debris in pelagic habitats of the subtropical gyres is a global phenomenon of growing concern, particularly with regard to wildlife. When animals ingest plastic debris that is associated with chemical contaminants, they are at risk of bioaccumulating hazardous pollutants. We examined the relationship between the bioaccumulation of hazardous chemicals in myctophid fish associated with plastic debris and plastic contamination in remote and previously unmonitored pelagic habitats in the South Atlantic Ocean. Using a published model, we defined three sampling zones where accumulated densities of plastic debris were predicted to differ. Contrary to model predictions, we found variable levels of plastic debris density across all stations within the sampling zones. Mesopelagic lanternfishes, sampled from each station and analyzed for bisphenol A (BPA), alkylphenols, alkylphenol ethoxylates, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), exhibited variability in contaminant levels, but this variability was not related to plastic debris density for most of the targeted compounds with the exception of PBDEs. We found that myctophid sampled at stations with greater plastic densities did have significantly larger concentrations of BDE#s 183 ??209 in their tissues suggesting that higher brominated congeners of PBDEs, added to plastics as flame-retardants, are indicative of plastic contamination in the marine environment. Our results provide data on a previously unsampled pelagic gyre and highlight the challenges associated with characterizing plastic debris accumulation and associated risks to wildlife.",1
5855G2JJ,High concentrations of plastic hidden beneath the surface of the Atlantic Ocean,"Concern over plastic pollution of the marine environment is severe. The mass-imbalance between the plastic litter supplied to and observed in the ocean currently suggests a missing sink. However, here we show that the ocean interior conceals high loads of small-sized plastic debris which can balance and even exceed the estimated plastic inputs into the ocean since 1950. The combined mass of just the three most-littered plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene) of 32??651????m size-class suspended in the top 200??m of the Atlantic Ocean is 11.6??21.1 Million Tonnes. Considering that plastics of other sizes and polymer types will be found in the deeper ocean and in the sediments, our results indicate that both inputs and stocks of ocean plastics are much higher than determined previously. It is thus critical to assess these terms across all size categories and polymer groups to determine the fate and danger of plastic contamination.",1
5RM9UAE3,Spatial and seasonal variation in diversity and structure of microbial biofilms on marine plastics in Northern European waters,"Plastic pollution is now recognised as a major threat to marine environments and marine biota. Recent research highlights that diverse microbial species are found to colonise plastic surfaces (the plastisphere) within marine waters. Here, we investigate how the structure and diversity of marine plastisphere microbial community vary with respect to season, location and plastic substrate type. We performed a 6-week exposure experiment with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles in the North Sea (UK) as well as sea surface sampling of plastic polymers in Northern European waters. Scanning electron microscopy revealed diverse plastisphere communities comprising prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing analysis revealed that plastisphere microbial communities on PET fragments varied both with season and location and comprised of bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and members of the eukaryotes Bacillariophyceae and Phaeophyceae. Polymers sampled from the sea surface mainly comprised polyethylene, polystyrene and polypropylene particles. Variation within plastisphere communities on different polymer types was observed, but communities were primarily dominated by Cyanobacteria. This research reveals that the composition of plastisphere microbial communities in marine waters varies with season, geographical location and plastic substrate type. We investigated structural and taxonomical variation of microbial biofilm communities on plastic fragments in coastal and offshore Northern European waters, with respect to season, geographical location and plastic type. We investigated structural and taxonomical variation of microbial biofilm communities on plastic fragments in coastal and offshore Northern European waters, with respect to season, geographical location and plastic type.",1
KZUJ9UCL,Pump-underway ship intake: An unexploited opportunity for Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) microplastic monitoring needs on coastal and oceanic waters,"Broad scale sampling methods for microplastic monitoring in the open ocean waters remain a challenge in oceanography. A large number of samples is required to understand the distribution, abundance and fate of microplastic particles in the environment. Despite more than a decade of widespread study, there is currently no established time series of microplastic measurements and the research community is yet to establish a standardised set of methods that will allow data to be collected in a quick, affordable and interoperable way. We present a sampling technique involving the connection of a custom-built microplastic sampling device to the pump-underway ship intake system of a research vessel (RV) as an unexploited opportunity for oceanic monitoring needs concerning microplastic abundance and distribution. The method is cost effective, highly versatile and accurate, and is able to sample particles down to 50??m from opportunity platforms, thus contributing to an emerging area of study, and in particular helping to increase the monitoring reporting of data, and thereby serving as a valuable aid for the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Sampling was performed during three consecutive oceanographic cruises in the subtropical NE Atlantic over a year, sampling subsurface waters (4 m depth) during navigation and while on coastal and oceanic stations. Microplastic particles were found in all stations and transects sampled. Fibres (64.42%) were predominant over fragments (35.58%), with the concentration values falling within the ranges of data reported for other areas of the Atlantic.",1
GF8CLRUQ,Microplastic pollution in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean: Validated and opportunistic sampling,"Levels of marine debris, including microplastics, are largely un-documented in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Broad scale monitoring efforts are required to understand the distribution, abundance and ecological implications of microplastic pollution. A method of continuous sampling was developed to be conducted in conjunction with a wide range of vessel operations to maximise vessel time. Transects covering a total of 12,700km were sampled through continuous monitoring of open ocean sub-surface water resulting in 470 samples. Items classified as potential plastics were identified in 94% of samples. A total of 2315particles were identified, 89% were less than 5mm in length classifying them as microplastics. Average plastic abundance in the Northeast Atlantic was calculated as 2.46particlesm???3. This is the first report to demonstrate the ubiquitous nature of microplastic pollution in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and to present a potential method for standardised monitoring of microplastic pollution.",1
IAZNN7MC,Spatial distribution of microplastics in sediments and surface waters of the southern North Sea,"Microplastic pollution within the marine environment is of pressing concern globally. Accordingly, spatial monitoring of microplastic concentrations, composition and size distribution may help to identify sources and entry pathways, and hence allow initiating focused mitigation. Spatial distribution patterns of microplastics were investigated in two compartments of the southern North Sea by collecting sublittoral sediment and surface water samples from 24 stations. Large microplastics (500???5000????m) were detected visually and identified using attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The remaining sample was digested enzymatically, concentrated onto filters and analyzed for small microplastics (11???500????m) using Focal Plane Array (FPA) FTIR imaging. Microplastics were detected in all samples with concentrations ranging between 2.8 and 1188.8 particles kg???1 for sediments and 0.1??245.4 particles m???3 for surface waters. On average 98% of microplastics were <100????m in sediments and 86% in surface waters. The most prevalent polymer types in both compartments were polypropylene, acrylates/polyurethane/varnish, and polyamide. However, polymer composition differed significantly between sediment and surface water samples as well as between the Frisian Islands and the English Channel sites. These results show that microplastics are not evenly distributed, in neither location nor size, which is illuminating regarding the development of monitoring protocols.",1
I7P3V5NZ,Enzymatic Purification of Microplastics in Environmental Samples,"Micro-Fourier transform infrared (micro-FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy enable the reliable identification and quantification of microplastics (MPs) in the lower micron range. Since concentrations of MPs in the environment are usually low, the large sample volumes required for these techniques lead to an excess of coenriched organic or inorganic materials. While inorganic materials can be separated from MPs using density separation, the organic fraction impedes the ability to conduct reliable analyses. Hence, the purification of MPs from organic materials is crucial prior to conducting an identification via spectroscopic techniques. Strong acidic or alkaline treatments bear the danger of degrading sensitive synthetic polymers. We suggest an alternative method, which uses a series of technical grade enzymes for purifying MPs in environmental samples. A basic enzymatic purification protocol (BEPP) proved to be efficient while reducing 98.3 ?? 0.1% of the sample matrix in surface water samples. After showing a high recovery rate (84.5 ?? 3.3%), the BEPP was successfully applied to environmental samples from the North Sea where numbers of MPs range from 0.05 to 4.42 items m??3. Experiences with different environmental sample matrices were considered in an improved and universally applicable version of the BEPP, which is suitable for focal plane array detector (FPA)-based micro-FTIR analyses of water, wastewater, sediment, biota, and food samples.",1
DITRNMSU,The effect of particle properties on the depth profile of buoyant plastics in the ocean,"Most studies on buoyant microplastics in the marine environment rely on sea surface sampling. Consequently, microplastic amounts can be underestimated, as turbulence leads to vertical mixing. Models that correct for vertical mixing are based on limited data. In this study we report measurements of the depth profile of buoyant microplastics in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, from 0 to 5??m depth. Microplastics were separated into size classes (0.5??1.5 and 1.5??5.0??mm) and types (??fragments?? and ??lines??) and associated with a sea state. Microplastic concentrations decreased exponentially with depth, with both sea state and particle properties affecting the steepness of the decrease. Concentrations approached zero within 5??m depth, indicating that most buoyant microplastics are present on or near the surface. Plastic rise velocities were also measured and were found to differ significantly for different sizes and shapes. Our results suggest that (1) surface samplers such as manta trawls underestimate total buoyant microplastic amounts by a factor of 1.04??30.0 and (2) estimations of depth-integrated buoyant plastic concentrations should be done across different particle sizes and types. Our findings can assist with improving buoyant ocean plastic vertical mixing models, mass balance exercises, impact assessments and mitigation strategies.",1
63ESKRQ2,"Microplastic abundance, distribution and composition along a latitudinal gradient in the Atlantic Ocean","Microplastics in the world's oceans are a global concern due to the potential threat they pose to marine organisms. This study investigated microplastic abundance, distribution and composition in the Atlantic Ocean on a transect from the Bay of Biscay to Cape Town, South Africa. Microplastics were sampled from sub-surface waters using the underway system of the RV Polarstern. Potential microplastics were isolated from samples and FT-IR spectroscopy was used to identify polymer types. Of the particles analysed, 63% were rayon and 37% were synthetic polymers. The majority of microplastics were identified as polyesters (49%) and blends of polyamide or acrylic/polyester (43%). Overall, fibres (94%) were predominant. Average microplastic abundance in the Atlantic Ocean was 1.15??1.45particlesm???3. Of the 76 samples, 14 were from the Benguela upwelling and there was no statistically significant difference in microplastic abundance between upwelled and non-upwelled sites.",1
9KKPS7T7,First observation on neustonic plastics in waters off NW Spain (spring 2013 and 2014),"This paper examines the presence and distribution of plastic particles in waters off the NW Spanish Atlantic coast. A pilot sampling program was initiated in 2013 to study the presence of plastic particles in surface waters. A total of 41 neuston samples were collected using a manta trawl fitted with a 333????m mesh (21 samples in 2013 and 20 samples in 2014). Several types of plastic particles were observed in 95% of the stations. A total of 1463 plastic microparticles (<5??mm; mps) and 208 mesoparticles (>5??mm and <20??mm; MPS) were counted. Average concentrations recorded were 0.034??????0.032 and 0.176??????0.278??mps??m???2 and 0.005??????0.005 and 0.028??????0.043??MPS??m???2, respectively for 2013 and 2014. Results on this emerging topic are discussed as a preliminary step towards implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in the region. Harmonization of protocols for determination of plastic particles is urgently needed in order to compare results between regions and to ensure coherence in the implementation of the MSFD. This aspect is also important at a worldwide scale.",1
5SWVF4NH,Microplastics in coastal sediments from Southern Portuguese shelf waters,"Microplastics are well-documented pollutants in the marine environment that result from fragmentation of larger plastic items. Due to their long chemical chains, they can remain in the environment for long periods of time. It is estimated that the vast majority (80%) of marine litter derives from land sources and that 70% will sink and remain at the bottom of the ocean. Microplastics that result from fragmentation of larger pieces of plastic are common to be found in beaches and in the water surface. The most common microplastics are pellets, fragments and fibres. This work provides original data of the presence of microplastics in coastal sediments from Southern Portuguese shelf waters, reporting on microplastic concentration and polymer types. Microplastic particles were found in nearly 56% of sediment samples, accounting a total of 31 particles in 27 samples. The vast majority were microfibers (25), identified as rayon fibres, and fragments (6) identified as polypropylene, through infrared spectroscopy (??-FTIR). The concentration and polymer type data is consistent with other relevant studies and reports worldwide.",1
R8CFT4YN,"Abundance, size and polymer composition of marine microplastics ???10??m in the Atlantic Ocean and their modelled vertical distribution","We studied abundance, size and polymer type of microplastic down to 10??m along a transect from the European Coast to the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (NASG) using an underway intake filtration technique and Raman micro-spectrometry. Concentrations ranged from 13 to 501itemsm???3. Highest concentrations were observed at the European coast, decreasing towards mid-Atlantic waters but elevated in the western NASG. We observed highest numbers among particles in the 10??20??m size fraction, whereas the total volume was highest in the 50??80??m range. Based on a numerical model size-dependent depth profiles of polyethylene microspheres in a range from 10??1000??m were calculated and show a strong dispersal throughout the surface mixed layer for sizes smaller than 200??m. From model and field study results we conclude that small microplastic is ubiquitously distributed over the ocean surface layer and has a lower residence time than larger plastic debris in this compartment.",1
XS2HS7JK,"Suspended Microplastics and Black Carbon Particles in the Jade System, Southern North Sea","Suspended microplastic and black carbon (BC) particles were determined in surface waters of the Jade system, southern North Sea, including freshwater sources. On average, 64??????194 granular particles, 88??????82 fibres and 30??????41 BC particles/L were recorded. Maximum numbers reached 1,770/L for granules, 650/L for fibres and 330/L for black carbon particles. The distribution along a transect from the inner to the outer part of the Jade system indicates granular particles to be dominant in the inner part, while fibres occur more prominently in the outer part. The distribution of BC particles was more uniform. All freshwater sources including sewage treatment plant effluents discharged microplastics, while BC was encountered only at two of nine discharge points.",1
AYVTRV7W,Microplastics in the pelagic environment around oceanic islands of the Western Tropical Atlantic Ocean,"Recent evidence suggests that microplastic pollution is widespread in every oceanic basin; however, there is limited data available for the tropical South Atlantic Ocean. The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution, density and characteristics of plastic particles in plankton samples collected in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean. Neustonic tows (N??=??160) were conducted near three important insular environments (Fernando de Noronha, Abrolhos and Trindade), and the presence of microplastics in the ocean surface of these areas was confirmed for the first time. The collected microplastic particles included hard plastic fragments, plastic films, paint chips and fibres and strands, which were classified as a secondary source of microplastics. The stock of plastic originates from both land-based and marine-based sources. This type of marine pollution in the tropical Atlantic Ocean is a potential threat to important ecological species.",1
P7X76ZUM,Anticyclonic eddies increase accumulation of microplastic in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre,"There are fundamental gaps in our understanding of the fates of microplastics in the ocean, which must be overcome if the severity of this pollution is to be fully assessed. The predominant pattern is high accumulation of microplastic in subtropical gyres. Using in situ measurements from the 7th Continent expedition in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, data from satellite observations and models, we show how microplastic concentrations were up to 9.4 times higher in an anticyclonic eddy explored, compared to the cyclonic eddy. Although our sample size is small, this is the first suggestive evidence that mesoscale eddies might trap, concentrate and potentially transport microplastics. As eddies are known to congregate nutrients and organisms, this phenomenon should be considered with regards to the potential impact of plastic pollution on the ecosystem in the open ocean.",1
P75I48YH,Marine environment microfiber contamination: Global patterns and the diversity of microparticle origins,"Microplastic and microfiber pollution has been documented in all major ocean basins. Microfibers are one of the most common microparticle pollutants along shorelines. Over 9 million tons of fibers are produced annually; 60% are synthetic and ???25% are non-synthetic. Non-synthetic and semi-synthetic microfibers are infrequently documented and not typically included in marine environment impact analyses, resulting in underestimation of a potentially pervasive and harmful pollutant. We present the most extensive worldwide microparticle distribution dataset using 1-liter grab samples (n??=??1393). Our citizen scientist driven study shows a global microparticle average of 11.8??????24.0 particles L???1 (mean??????SD), approximately three orders of magnitude higher than global model predictions. Open ocean samples showed consistently higher densities than coastal samples, with the highest concentrations found in the polar oceans (n??=??51), confirming previous empirical and theoretical studies. Particles were predominantly microfibers (91%) and 0.1??1.5??mm in length (77%), a smaller size than those captured in the majority of surface studies. Using ??FT-IR we determined the material types of 113 pieces; 57% were classified as synthetic, 12% as semi-synthetic, and 31% as non-synthetic. Samples were taken globally, including from coastal environments and understudied ocean regions. Some of these sites are emerging as areas of concentrated floating plastic and anthropogenic debris, influenced by distant waste mismanagement and/or deposition of airborne particles. Incorporation of smaller-sized microfibers in oceanographic models, which has been lacking, will help us to better understand the movement and transformation of synthetic, semi-synthetic and non-synthetic microparticles in regional seas and ocean basins.",1
EMM6S84E,Nanoplastic in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre,"Plastics can be found in all ecosystems across the globe. This type of environmental pollution is important, even if its impact is not fully understood. The presence of small plastic particles at the micro- and nanoscales is of growing concern, but nanoplastic has not yet been observed in natural samples. In this study, we examined four size fractions (meso-, large micro-, small micro-, and nanoplastics) of debris collected in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. To obtain the nanoplastic portion, we isolated the colloidal fraction of seawater. After ultrafiltration, the occurrence of nanoscale particles was demonstrated using dynamic light scattering experiments. The chemical fingerprint of the colloids was obtained by pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography??mass spectrometry. We demonstrated that the signal was anthropogenic and attributed to a combination of plastics. The polymer composition varied among the size classes. At the micro- and nanoscales, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene and polyethylene were observed. We also observed changes in the pyrolytic signals of polyethylene with decreasing debris size, which could be related to the structural modification of this plastic as a consequence of weathering.",1
DK98Z24Y,Comparison of Raman and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy for the Quantification of Microplastics in the Aquatic Environment,"Microplastics (MPs, <5 mm) have been reported as emerging environmental contaminants, but reliable data are still lacking. We compared the two most promising techniques for MP analysis, namely, Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, by analyzing MPs extracted from North Sea surface waters. Microplastics >500 ??m were visually sorted and manually analyzed by ??-Raman and attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy. Microplastics ???500 ??m were concentrated on gold-coated filters and analyzed by automated single-particle exploration coupled to ??-Raman (ASPEx-??-Raman) and FTIR imaging (reflection mode). The number of identified MPs >500 ??m was slightly higher for ??-Raman (+23%) than ATR-FTIR analysis. Concerning MPs ???500 ??m, ASPEx-??-Raman quantified two-times higher MP numbers but required a four-times higher analysis time compared to FTIR imaging. Because ASPEx-??-Raman revealed far higher MP concentrations (38??2621 particles m??3) compared to the results of previous water studies (0??559 particles m??3), the environmental concentration of MPs ???500 ??m may have been underestimated until now. This may be attributed to the exceptional increase in concentration with decreasing MP size found in this work. Our results demonstrate the need for further research to enable time-efficient routine application of ASPEx-??-Raman for reliable MP counting down to 1 ??m.",1
WYBUXETW,Plastic debris in the surface waters of the South Atlantic,"Polyethylene and polypropylene pellets, together with tarballs, were found to be the most common contaminates of the sea surface in the Cape Basin area of the South Atlantic Ocean. This is an area far removed from any obvious source of such materials.",1
TAELGWLP,Neustonic microplastic and zooplankton in the North Western Mediterranean Sea,"Neustonic microplastic and zooplankton abundance was determined in the North Western Mediterranean Sea during a summer cruise between July 9th and August 6th 2010, with a break between July 22th and 25th due to a strong wind event. Ninety percent of the 40 stations contained microplastic particles (size 0.3??5mm) of various compositions: e.g., filaments, polystyrene, thin plastic films. An average concentration of 0.116particles/m2 was observed. The highest abundances (>0.36particles/m2) were observed in shelf stations. The neustonic plastic particles concentrations were 5 times higher before than after the strong wind event which increased the mixing and the vertical repartition of plastic particles in the upper layers of the water column. The values rise in the same order of magnitude than in the North Pacific Gyre. The average ratio between microplastics and mesozooplankton weights was 0.5 for the whole survey and might induce a potential confusion for zooplankton feeders.",1
FJ5BIPZ8,Annual variation in neustonic micro- and meso-plastic particles and zooplankton in the Bay of Calvi (Mediterranean??Corsica),"The annual variation in neustonic plastic particles and zooplankton was studied in the Bay of Calvi (Corsica) between 30 August 2011 and 7 August 2012. Plastic particles were classified into three size classes, small microplastics (0.2??2mm), large microplastics (2??5mm) and mesoplastics (5??10mm). 74% of the 38 samples contained plastic particles of varying composition: e.g. filaments, polystyrene, thin plastic films. An average concentration of 6.2particles/100m2 was observed. The highest abundance values (69 particles/100m2) observed occurred during periods of low offshore wind conditions. These values rose in the same order of magnitude as in previous studies in the North Western Mediterranean. The relationships between the abundance values of the size classes between zooplankton and plastic particles were then examined. The ratio for the intermediate size class (2??5mm) reached 2.73. This would suggest a potential confusion for predators regarding planktonic prey of this size class.",1
CIVILJ4L,Plastic Accumulation in the Mediterranean Sea,"Concentrations of floating plastic were measured throughout the Mediterranean Sea to assess whether this basin can be regarded as a great accumulation region of plastic debris. We found that the average density of plastic (1 item per 4 m2), as well as its frequency of occurrence (100% of the sites sampled), are comparable to the accumulation zones described for the five subtropical ocean gyres. Plastic debris in the Mediterranean surface waters was dominated by millimeter-sized fragments, but showed a higher proportion of large plastic objects than that present in oceanic gyres, reflecting the closer connection with pollution sources. The accumulation of floating plastic in the Mediterranean Sea (between 1,000 and 3,000 tons) is likely related to the high human pressure together with the hydrodynamics of this semi-enclosed basin, with outflow mainly occurring through a deep water layer. Given the biological richness and concentration of economic activities in the Mediterranean Sea, the affects of plastic pollution on marine and human life are expected to be particularly frequent in this plastic accumulation region.",1
WMBC8YXE,Are baleen whales exposed to the threat of microplastics? A case study of the Mediterranean fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus),"Baleen whales are potentially exposed to micro-litter ingestion as a result of their filter-feeding activity. However, the impacts of microplastics on baleen whales are largely unknown. In this case study of the Mediterranean fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), we explore the toxicological effects of microplastics on mysticetes. The study included the following three steps: (1) the collection/count of microplastics in the Pelagos Sanctuary (Mediterranean Sea), (2) the detection of phthalates in surface neustonic/planktonic samples, and (3) the detection of phthalates in stranded fin whales. A total of 56% of the surface neustonic/planktonic samples contained microplastic particles. The highest abundance of microplastics (9.63items/m3) was found in the Portofino MPA (Ligurian Sea). High concentrations of phthalates (DEHP and MEHP) were detected in the neustonic/planktonic samples. The concentrations of MEHP found in the blubber of stranded fin whales suggested that phthalates could serve as a tracer of the intake of microplastics. The results of this study represent the first warning of this emerging threat to baleen whales.",1
K9GNZPWT,Sea surface microplastics in Slovenian part of the Northern Adriatic,Plastics are the most common material of marine litter and have become a global pollution concern. They are persistent in the environment where they gradually degrade into increasingly smaller particles??microplastics (MP). Our study presents results of sea-surface monitoring for MP in the Slovenian part of the Trieste Bay in the Northern Adriatic Sea. In 17 trawls conducted over a 20-month period we found a high average concentration of 406??103MPparticles/km2. Over 80% of the particles were identified as polyethylene. The significant variability of MP concentrations obtained on different sampling dates is explained by use of surface current maps and a recently developed Markov chain marine litter distribution model for the Adriatic Sea.,1
Z6SUVX3R,Micro- and mesoplastics in Northeast Levantine coast of Turkey: The preliminary results from surface samples,"The determination of the microplastic distribution will be beneficial as a measure of the potential effects on the environment. The Mediterranean Sea had a high risk of pollution as it was enclosed by highly populated and industrialized countries. Here, we determined the level of micro- and mesoplastic pollution in Iskenderun and Mersin Bays, located in the Northeastern Levantine coast of Turkey. The average level of both micro- and mesoplastic was determined to be 0.376 item/m2 at seven stations. The highest level was determined in Mersin Bay at the mouth of the Seyhan river (Station no. 7, with 906 items), and the lowest level was found in Station no. 4 in Iskenderun Bay (78 items). As a result of this study, it was determined that the microplastic pollution level in the Mediterranean coast of Turkey was similar to the other regions of the Mediterranean Sea.",1
4FFVEC9Z,How microplastics quantities increase with flood events? An example from Mersin Bay NE Levantine coast of Turkey,"Floods caused by heavy rain carry significant amounts of pollutants into marine environments. This study evaluates the effect of multiple floods that occurred in the northeastern Mediterranean region in Turkey between December 2016 and January 2017 on the microplastic pollution in the Mersin Bay. Sampling was repeated in four different stations both before and after the flood period, and it was determined that in the four stations, there was an average of 539,189 MPs/km2 before the flood, and 7,699,716 MPs/km2 afterwards, representing a 14-fold increase. Fourteen different polymer types were detected in an ATR FT-IR analysis, eight of which were not found in samples collected before the floods. The most common polymer type was identified as polyethylene both pre- and post-flood. The mean particle size, which was 2.37??mm in the pre-flood period, decreased to 1.13??mm in the post-flood period. A hydrodynamic modeling study was implemented to hindcast the current structure and the spatial and temporal distributions of microplastics within the study area. In conclusion, heavy rain and severe floods can dramatically increase the microplastic levels in the sea.",1
KZHUK3WY,"Microplastic litter composition of the Turkish territorial waters of the Mediterranean Sea, and its occurrence in the gastrointestinal tract of fish","Microplastic pollution of marine environment is receiving increased publicity over the last few years. The present survey is, according to our knowledge, the survey with the largest sample size analyzed, to date. In total, 1337 specimens of fish were examined for the presence of plastic microlitter representing 28 species and 14 families. In addition, samples of seawater and sediment were also analyzed for the quantification of microplastic in the same region. Samples of water/sediment were collected from 18 locations along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. 94% of all collected plastic microlitter from the sea was in the size range between 0.1 and 2.5??mm, while the occurrence of other sizes was rare. The quantity of microplastic particles in surface water samples ranged from 16??339 to 520??213 per km2. Fish were collected from 10 locations from which 8 were either shared with or situated in the proximity of water/sediment sampling locations. A total of 1822 microplastic particles were extracted from stomach and intestines of fish. Majority of ingested particles were represented by fibers (70%) and hard plastic (20.8%), while the share of other groups: nylon (2.7%), rubber (0.8%) and miscellaneous plastic (5.5%) were low. The blue color of plastic was the most dominant color. 34% of all examined fish had microplastic in the stomach. On average, fish which had microplastic contained 1.80 particles per stomach. 41% of all fish had microplastic in the intestines with an average of 1.81 particles per fish. 771 specimens contained microplastic in either stomach and/or intestines representing 58% of the total sample with an average of 2.36 particles per fish. Microplastic was found in all species/families that had sample size of at least 2 individuals. The number of particles present in either stomach or intestines ranged between 1 and 35. Ingested microplastic had an average diameter ??SD of 656??????803????m, however particles as small as 9????m were detected. The trophic level of fish species had no influence whatsoever on the amount of ingested microplastic. Pelagic fish ingested more microplastic than demersal species. In general, fish that ingested higher number of microplastic particles originated from the sites that also had a higher particle count in the seawater and sediment.",1
CMINE49Y,Floating microplastics and aggregate formation in the Western Mediterranean Sea,"Pollution by large-sized plastics and microplastic debris is widespread in all Earth environments, also threatening marine ecosystems worldwide. In this study we determine the load of microplastics in the Western Mediterranean Sea and evaluate their aggregation potential into marine aggregates. We report average microplastic abundances of 0.10??????0.09??items??m???2 (max: 0.50??items??m???2). Abundances and chemical composition of microplastics are subject to temporal changes as a function of human activities in the areas of influence and shifting meteorological and sea-state conditions. We find that microplastics were on average smaller in mass than other studies conducted in the Mediterranean Sea indicating longer exposure times in the environment. The microplastic aggregation potential was determined by inspecting formed biogenic aggregates either during sample collection or in the laboratory. Smaller and more angular microplastics dominated in marine aggregates, representing an average 40% in abundance and 25% in mass of microplastics.",1
MR92LCBJ,Exceptionally high abundances of microplastics in the oligotrophic Israeli Mediterranean coastal waters,"Seasonal sea surface microplastic distribution was recorded at 17 sites along the Israeli Mediterranean coast. Microplastics (0.3??5mm) were found in all samples, with a mean abundance of 7.68??2.38particles/m3 or 1,518,340particles/km2. Some areas had higher abundances of microplastics than others, although differences were neither consistent nor statistically significant. In some cases microplastic particles were found floating in large patches. One of these patches contained an extraordinary number of plastic particles; 324particles/m3 or 64,812,600particles/km2. Microplastic abundances in Israeli coastal waters are disturbingly high; mean values were 1??2 orders of magnitude higher than abundances reported in other parts of the world. Light-colored (white or transparent) fragments were by far more abundant than all other microplastic colors and types. The results of this study underline the need for action to reduce the flux of plastics to the marine environment.",1
MBA6WH9T,Changes in the Floating Plastic Pollution of the Mediterranean Sea in Relation to the Distance to Land,"The composition, size distribution, and abundance of floating plastic debris in surface waters of the Mediterranean Sea were analyzed in relation to distance to land. We combined data from previously published reports with an intensive sampling in inshore waters of the Northwestern Mediterranean. The highest plastic concentrations were found in regions distant from from land as well as in the first kilometer adjacent to the coastline. In this nearshore water strip, plastic concentrations were significantly correlated with the nearness to a coastal human population, with local areas close to large human settlements showing hundreds of thousands of plastic pieces per km2. The ratio of plastic to plankton abundance reached particularly high values for the coastal surface waters. Polyethylene, polypropylene and polyamides were the predominant plastic polymers at all distances from coast (86 to 97% of total items), although the diversity of polymers was higher in the 1-km coastal water strip due to a higher frequency of polystyrene or polyacrylic fibers. The plastic size distributions showed a gradual increase in abundance toward small sizes indicating an efficient removal of small plastics from the surface. Nevertheless, the relative abundance of small fragments (< 2 mm) was higher within the 1-km coastal water strip, suggesting a rapid fragmentation down along the shoreline, likely related with the washing ashore on the beaches. This study constitutes a first attempt to determine the impact of plastic debris in areas closest to Mediterranean coast. The presence of a high concentration of plastic including tiny plastic items could have significant environmental, health and economic impacts.",1
SKMMZNW2,Floating plastic debris in the Central and Western Mediterranean Sea,"In two sea voyages throughout the Mediterranean (2011 and 2013) that repeated the historical travels of Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria (1847??1915), 71 samples of floating plastic debris were obtained with a Manta trawl. Floating plastic was observed in all the sampled sites, with an average weight concentration of 579.3??g dw km???2 (maximum value of 9298.2??g dw km???2) and an average particle concentration of 147,500 items km???2 (the maximum concentration was 1,164,403 items km???2). The plastic size distribution showed microplastics (<5??mm) in all the samples. The most abundant particles had a surface area of approximately 1??mm2 (the mesh size was 333????m). The general estimate obtained was a total value of 1455 tons dw of floating plastic in the entire Mediterranean region, with various potential spatial accumulation areas.",1
URL35CSP,"Now, you see me: High concentrations of floating plastic debris in the coastal waters of the Balearic Islands (Spain)","Coastal ecosystems are under significant human pressure, partly due to the proximity of pollution sources. In this study, a total of 20 samples were taken in summer around the coastal waters of the Balearic Islands (Spain) using a manta trawl net to examine the concentrations of floating plastic debris through the NIXE III project campaign. Although plastic concentrations showed high variability along the coast, the higher particle concentration (max: 4,576,115 items ??? km???2) and weight (max: 8,102.94 g(DW) ??? km???2) values were located at the north of the Balearic Promontory. The particle size analysis showed the high prevalence of microplastics (< 5??mm) in these waters, where particles of approximately 0.7??mm and 1??mm2 were the most frequent in the range analyzed. The high plastic concentration values in the N-NW coast of Ibiza and Mallorca in sparsely populated locations suggest that the plastic particle distribution was mostly conditioned by the hydrodynamic surface conditions.",1
RZ5J8YZG,The Mediterranean Plastic Soup: synthetic polymers in Mediterranean surface waters,"The Mediterranean Sea has been recently proposed as one of the most impacted regions of the world with regards to microplastics, however the polymeric composition of these floating particles is still largely unknown. Here we present the results of a large-scale survey of neustonic micro- and meso-plastics floating in Mediterranean waters, providing the first extensive characterization of their chemical identity as well as detailed information on their abundance and geographical distribution. All particles >700????m collected in our samples were identified through FT-IR analysis (n??=??4050 particles), shedding for the first time light on the polymeric diversity of this emerging pollutant. Sixteen different classes of synthetic materials were identified. Low-density polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene were the most abundant compounds, followed by polyamides, plastic-based paints, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene and polyvinyl alcohol. Less frequent polymers included polyethylene terephthalate, polyisoprene, poly(vinyl stearate), ethylene-vinyl acetate, polyepoxide, paraffin wax and polycaprolactone, a biodegradable polyester reported for the first time floating in off-shore waters. Geographical differences in sample composition were also observed, demonstrating sub-basin scale heterogeneity in plastics distribution and likely reflecting a complex interplay between pollution sources, sinks and residence times of different polymers at sea.",1
XB4RX3QN,Floating plastics in Adriatic waters (Mediterranean Sea): From the macro- to the micro-scale,"Macro- and microplastics abundances were determined in the Adriatic Sea following the MSFD TG10 protocol. The studied areas included populated gulfs, river outlets and offshore waters in five Adriatic countries. The use of small ships enabled us to detect small sized plastics (2.5??5??cm) and record average macroplastics densities of 251??????601 items km???2, one order of magnitude higher than previously considered. Results from manta net tows for microplastics revealed an average abundance of 315,009??????568,578 items km???2 (217??????575??g??km???2). We found significantly higher microplastics abundances in nearshore (???4??km) than in offshore waters (>4??km) and this trend seems to affect also the small sized macro plastic fragments (2.5??5??cm). The dominant polymers were polyethylene and polypropylene while the presence of some rare polymers and waxes used in food and dentistry indicated waste water treatment plants as potential sources of microplastics.",1
