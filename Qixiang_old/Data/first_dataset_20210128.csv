3D5HUXSL,10.1038/s41598-020-80606-5,Preliminary indoor evidences of microplastic effects on freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates,"Plastics are to date considered one of the main detrimental drivers for the health of aquatic ecosystems, both in marine and inland waters. Regarding the latter habitat, it seems surprising how the plastic effects on benthic invertebrates are neglected since macroinvertebrates have a long tradition in the water quality assessment activities. In this context, we propose timely indoor observations on the exposure of caddisfly Odontocerum albicorne and mayfly Ephemera danica to various microplastic polymers (ABS, PET, PP, PS, PVDF). Three different experimental designs were performed on caddisflies and mayflies by exposing their larvae to natural and microplastic substrates. Our findings highlighted how microplastics affected both caddisflies in rebuilding its own case (after having removed the natural one) and mayflies burrowing. Particularly, all caddisflies rebuilt cases using the microplastic polymers provided instead of natural items only. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that mayflies burrow mainly in microplastic substrates rather than in natural ones. Our research highlights that macroinvertebrate larvae would use naturally occurring microplastics and this could be of particular concern in freshwaters with high contamination by plastics. Indeed, larvae appear to not necessarily perceive microplastics as a direct stressor. Further studies ought to be conducted to understand the chronic perturbation on larvae fitness and for example, on drift behaviour. Also, further investigations are needed to understand the potentialities of using plastics by benthic macroinvertebrates. ?? 2021, The Author(s).",irrelevant
SPBNE3KR,10.1038/s41598-020-79370-3,Seagrasses provide a novel ecosystem service by trapping marine plastics,"There is strong evidence that the seafloor constitutes a final sink for plastics from land sources. There is also evidence that part of the plastics lying on the shallow seafloor are washed up back to the shoreline. However, little is known on the natural trapping processes leading to such landwards return. Here we investigate microplastics and larger plastic debris within beached seagrass remains including balls (aegagropilae) made of natural aggregates of vegetal fibers intertwined by seawater motion. We found up to 1470 plastic items per kg of plant material, which were mainly composed of negatively buoyant polymer filaments and fibers. Our findings show that seagrass meadows promote plastic debris trapping and aggregation with natural lignocellulosic fibers, which are then ejected and escape the coastal ocean. Our results show how seagrasses, one of the key ecosystems on Earth in terms of provision of goods and services, also counteract marine plastic pollution. In view of our findings, the regression of seagrass meadows in some marine regions acquires a new dimension. ?? 2021, The Author(s).",uncertain

Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) biocomposites with Miscanthus (Misc) fibres and distillers?€? dried grains with solubles (DDGS) were studied to ascertain if natural fibres and proteinaceous fillers can improve polyhydroxyalkanoate marine biodegradability. Using ASTM standard D7991-15, the biodegradation of PHBV, PHBV with Misc (15 and 25 wt%) and PHBV with DDGS (15 and 25 wt%) was performed in a simulated marine environment for the first time, as indicated by a literature survey. PHBV/Misc (85/15) and (75/25) biocomposites showed 15 and 25% more biodegradation compared to PHBV, respectively. Proteinaceous PHBV/DDGS (85/15) and (75/25) biocomposites showed 17 and 40% more biodegradation compared to PHBV, respectively. Furthermore, PHBV/Misc (75/25) and PHBV/DDGS (75/25) biocomposites were marine biodegraded in 412 and 295 days, respectively. In conclusion, proteinaceous fillers (DDGS) biocomposites have better marine biodegradability than miscanthus. ?? 2021, The Author(s).",irrelevant
BELAGTQW,10.1016/j.jmst.2020.10.063,Effects of intermittent loading time and stress ratio on dwell fatigue behavior of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V ELI used in deep-sea submersibles,"Different components of deep-sea submersibles, such as the pressure hull, are usually subjected to intermittent loading, dwell loading, and unloading during service. Therefore, for the design and reliability assessment of structural parts under dwell fatigue loading, understanding the effects of intermittent loading time on dwell fatigue behavior of the alloys is essential. In this study, the effects of the intermittent loading time and stress ratio on dwell fatigue behavior of the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4 V ELI were investigated. Results suggest that the dwell fatigue failure modes of Ti-6Al-4 V ELI can be classified into three types, i.e., fatigue failure mode, ductile failure mode, and mixed failure mode. The intermittent loading time does not affect the dwell fatigue behavior, whereas the stress ratio significantly affects the dwell fatigue life and dwell fatigue mechanism. The dwell fatigue life increases with an increase in the stress ratio for the same maximum stress, and specimens with a negative stress ratio tend to undergo ductile failure. The mechanism of dwell fatigue of titanium alloys is attribute to an increase in the plastic strain caused by the part of the dwell loading, thereby resulting in an increase in the actual stress of the specimens during the subsequent loading cycles and aiding the growth of the formed crack or damage, along with the local plastic strain or damage induced by the part of the fatigue load promoting the cumulative plastic strain during the dwell fatigue process. The interaction between dwell loading and fatigue loading accelerates specimen failure, in contrast to the case for individual creep or fatigue loading alone. The dwell fatigue life and cumulative maximum strain during the first loading cycle could be correlated by a linear relationship on the log?€?log scale. This relationship can be used to evaluate the dwell fatigue life of Ti alloys with the maximum stress dwell. ?? 2020",irrelevant
JMPMKT8S,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124982,Factors influencing the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in coastal sediments: From source to sink,"Microplastic (MP) pollution is attracting growing global attention, but little is known about the factors influencing MP occurrence and distributions in marine sediments. Here, MPs were sampled from the sediments of two semi-enclosed bays (Jinghai Bay and Laizhou Bay) and two coastal open zones (Lancelet Reserve and Solen grandis Reserve) in China. The order of MP abundance was Jinghai Bay > Laizhou Bay > Lancelet Reserve > Solen grandis Reserve. Average MP diversity indices for Laizhou Bay (1.84 ?? 0.18), Lancelet Reserve (1.59 ?? 0.43), S. grandis Reserve (1.58 ?? 0.89), and Jinghai Bay (1.43 ?? 0.14) revealed Laizhou Bay had the most complicated MP sources. A significant negative correlation between MP abundance and sediment grain size occurred in the semi-enclosed coastal zones (p = 0.004, r = ???0.618) rather than in the open coastal zones (p = 0.051, r = ???0.480), indicating small sediment particles can strongly enhance MP accumulation in semi-enclosed costal sediments. Although anthropogenic activities influence the MP distribution at source, the composition of regional and local sediments might impact MP occurrence in semi-enclosed coastal zones from the sink. These results help to improve our understanding of the fate and inventory of MPs in coastal sediments. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",relevant
NV3P66HB,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144484,"Neglected microplastics pollution in the nearshore surface waters derived from coastal fishery activities in Weihai, China","Plastic fishing gears have been widely used in marine fishing and mariculture, which could cause serious microplastics pollution but receive little attention. To further figure out the effect of fishery activities on microplastics, the occurrence and sources of microplastics contamination in the nearshore surface seawater of Weihai (a coastal fishery city of China) were studied. All the collected microplastics were sorted and counted based on their size, shape, and color. The distribution of microplastics pollution in this study areas was mapped. The results showed that the mean concentration of all sampling sites was 5.9??3.5 particles/m3; the concentration in the mariculture areas was 11.49 particles/m3, much higher than that in other areas without mariculture 1.57 particles/m3. Fragment and fiber accounted for 45.4% and 28.2% of the total microplastics, respectively. Most fibers and fragments were identified as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), mainly originated from the fishing nets/ropes. Polystyrene (PS) was also generally detected in the samples due to the foam floating balls used in the mariculture area. Our research strongly suggested that marine fishery activities, especially for mariculture, could be an underestimated sea-based microplastics source and more attentions should be given. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",relevant
U8ICGBMY,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144655,"Assessing small-scale freshwater microplastics pollution, land-use, source-to-sink conduits, and pollution risks: Perspectives from Japanese rivers polluted with microplastics","Rivers are vital for understanding freshwater microplastics pollution, along with the conduits from land-sources to marine-sinks. In this study, we investigated microplastics in the small-scale Awano and Ayaragi rivers, which flow into the Sea of Japan (SJ), and the Asa and Majime rivers, which flow into the Seto Inland Sea (SIS) in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. Surface water samples were collected from 29 stations. Filtration, wet peroxidation, and density separation methods were employed to extract microplastics. Polymers were identified via attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Microplastics abundances and comparisons among different rivers revealed that these small-scale rivers were highly polluted than others around the world. Characterization demonstrated that small microplastics (<1000 ??m) in size, fibers and fragments in shape and the polymers?€?polyethylene, polypropylene, vinylon, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene were dominant. These small-scale rivers emitted substantially higher quantities of Japan land-sourced microplastics (0.4?€?154.27 billions/day and 0.01?€?17.55 tons/day) into the SJ and SIS environments than larger rivers in other countries compared to basin areas. The pollution load index indicated that all the river stations were polluted with microplastics. An assessment of the polymeric and pollution risks revealed variably low to high risks. The higher were the abundances of microplastics and toxic polymers, the higher were the pollution level and risks. The sites at high risk of pollution were regarded as hotspots. Both point and non-point land-uses sources of pollution could release microplastics into the river freshwater environments, affected posing high risks and hotspots. Moreover, the pollution characteristics (shapes-sizes-colors-polymers) indicated serious ecotoxicological threats to these rivers and their downstream environments. This study provided new insights into river microplastics pollution and revealed small-scale rivers to be prominent source-to-sink microplastics conduits. Risk assessments provided a baseline for future comprehensive assessments and developing practical approaches to wards setting water quality criteria, pollution control and management. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant
F47I5TSJ,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124770,"Recommended best practices for collecting, analyzing, and reporting microplastics in environmental media: Lessons learned from comprehensive monitoring of San Francisco Bay","Microplastics are ubiquitous and persistent contaminants in the ocean and a pervasive and preventable threat to the health of marine ecosystems. Microplastics come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and plastic types, each with unique physical and chemical properties and toxicological impacts. Understanding the magnitude of the microplastic problem and determining the highest priorities for mitigation require accurate measures of microplastic occurrence in the environment and identification of likely sources. The field of microplastic pollution is in its infancy, and there are not yet widely accepted standards for sample collection, laboratory analyses, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), or reporting of microplastics in environmental samples. Based on a comprehensive assessment of microplastics in San Francisco Bay water, sediment, fish, bivalves, stormwater, and wastewater effluent, we developed recommended best practices for collecting, analyzing, and reporting microplastics in environmental media. We recommend factors to consider in microplastic study design, particularly in regard to site selection and sampling methods. We also highlight the need for standard QA/QC practices such as collection of field and laboratory blanks, use of methods beyond microscopy to identify particle composition, and standardized reporting practices, including suggested vocabulary for particle classification. ?? 2021 The Authors",relevant
ISHRGXSQ,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124979,Selection of antibiotic resistance genes on biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics,"Growing evidence have demonstrated that microplastics in the marine ecosystem can provide novel substrates for biofilm formation, potentially facilitating the spread of antibiotic resistance. However, the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the biofilm on microplastics has not been fully explored. This study used the metagenomic data of biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics staged at a coastal lagoon in the northern Gulf of Mexico to profile the ARGs and their bacterial hosts. The abundance and Shannon diversity of ARGs on biodegradable poly hydroxy alkanoate (PHA) and non-biodegradable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) have no significant differences. Nevertheless, the abundance of multidrug resistance genes on PET (3.05 copies per 16S rRNA) was statistically higher than that on PHA (2.05). Beta diversity showed that the overall pattern of resistome on PHA was significantly distinct with that on PET. Procrustes analysis suggested a good-fit correlation between ARG profiles and bacterial community composition. The host-tracking analysis identified that Pseudomonas was always the major host for glycopeptide and multidrug resistance genes in PET and PHA biofilms, whereas the primary host for macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) changed to Desulfovibrio on PET. This study provided the first metagenomic insights into the ARGs and their hosts on biodegradable and non-biodegradable microplastics, suggesting that both two types of plastics harbor ARGs with preferences. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant
QXA7D4HT,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144345,You are what you eat: Microplastics in the feces of young men living in Beijing,"Purpose: Microplastics have been widely detected in the environment and marine organisms. However, few studies have investigated the presence of microplastics in humans. This preliminary study identified and quantified the microplastic content in human feces. Methods: A total of 26 young male students aged 18?€?25 years were recruited from Beijing, China. A self-administered 7-day 24-h fluid intake record was used to document fluid intake, and food intake was recorded for 3 days. Feces were collected by participants using a sterile fecal collector. Microplastics in the remaining fecal residues were measured and identified using fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy. Results: Eventually, twenty-four participants completed the study. The fecal samples of 23 (95.8%) participants tested positive for microplastics. In these 23 samples, the abundance of microplastics varied from 1 particle/g to 36 particles/g (size 20 to 800 ??m). The summed mass of all microplastic particles per participant ranged from 0.01 to 14.6 mg. Qualitative analysis of the microplastics indicated the presence of one to eight types of microplastics in each sample, with polypropylene (PP) being the most abundant; it was found in 95.8% of fecal samples. We examined associations between water intake habits and the abundance of microplastics in their feces. A moderate correlation was observed between packaged water and beverage intake and microplastic abundance in feces (r = 0.445, P = 0.029). Conclusion: Various types of microplastics were detected in human feces, with PP being found in the highest proportion. There may be an association between water intake habits and microplastic abundance in feces. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant
FDIDZPWR,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144695,"How mangrove plants affect microplastic distribution in sediments of coastal wetlands: Case study in Shenzhen Bay, South China","Microplastic pollution is common in marine and coastal ecosystems, especially in mangrove wetlands. However, factors affecting the distribution of microplastics, such as plants, have not been sufficiently studied. We investigated the effect of different plant species on the distribution of sediment microplastics in two Nature Reserves in South China, viz. Futian Mangrove and Mai Po Mangrove. In Futian Mangrove, the abundance of total microplastics among three monospecific mangrove stands dominated by Sonneratia caseolaris, Kandelia obovata, and Sonneratia apetala was similar. The abundance of microplastics in the mudflat was similar to that in the forest interior, except for the fact that more fiber was found in the mudflat than in the interior of Sonneratia apetala. This suggested that the dense pneumatophores at the fringe prevented fibers from entering the mangrove forest. The significant positive dependence (p < 0.05) between the density of Sonneratia pneumatophores and the abundance of fibers highlighted the importance of pneumatophores. The abundance of total microplastics, predominantly in the form of fibers, in sediments at the forest fringe (2835 ?? 713 items/kg d.w. and 2070 ?? 224 items/kg d.w. in Futian and Mai Po, respectively) was higher than that in the forest interior and mudflat. There was no difference between the two latter locations in both mangroves, which demonstrated the significance of the fringe effect. This paper reports for the first time that the spatial distribution of microplastics in mangrove sediments was affected by plant species, which provides useful information for environmental processes of microplastics in coastal wetlands. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",uncertain

The average numbers of MPs in the water column and sediment were 48 ?? 19 MP particles/L (MPs/L) and 3950 ?? 930 MP particles/kg (MPs/kg), respectively. In shellfish (whole soft tissue), the average concentrations of MPs were 4 ?? 2 (Crassostrea sp.), 3.2 ?? 1.8 (Perna viridis) and 0.7 ?? 0.3 (Paphia malbarica) MPs/g body weight (bw), respectively. The highest MPs were recorded in finfish (gastro-intestinal tract) (Mugil cephalus)7.8 ?? 4, followed by (Gerres filamentosus) 5.3 ?? 4.9, (Arius jella) 4.6 ?? 2.6, and (Etroplus suratensis)1.4 ?? 0.3 MP/g bw. MP fibres were predominant in all matrices. Interestingly, a dominance of small sized (10?€?300 ??m) MPs was recorded in biota. Among the 37 polymer types identified by ??-FTIR, the most prevalent ones were, polyacrylamide (PAM), polyacetylene, ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyamide (nylon). Notably, the polymers dominant in the gut of finfish and in whole shellfish were equally prominent in sediment and the water column. This study highlights the presence of MPs in commercially important shellfish and finfish samples from the Sal estuary. This study clearly shows the presence of MPs in various types of marine organisms in the Sal estuary. As shellfish is locally consumed as a delicacy and plays a major role in the seafood industry, the MPs may pose a hazard for human health. There is also an ecological risk as MPs are also found in water and sediment and in the digestive tract of finfish. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",relevant
85WBN3ZI,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129479,Microplastics in different tissues of wild crabs at three important fishing grounds in China,"Crabs are an indispensable component of the benthic ecosystem and represent a type of seafood that is easily obtained and frequently eaten by humans. However, little is known about microplastic (MP) accumulation in different tissues of crabs in important fishing areas. In this study, the abundances and characteristics of MPs in different tissues of four species of wild crabs (Portunus trituberculatus, Charybdis japonica, Dorippe japonica, and Matuta planipes) were investigated across 9 sites at three important fishing grounds (Haizhou Bay, Lvsi and Yangtze River Estuary fishing grounds) in China. Crabs from all sites were found to contain MPs, with a total detection rate of 89.34%. The MP abundance in crabs from all sites ranged from 2.00 ?? 2.00 to 9.81 ?? 8.08 items/individual and 0.80 ?? 1.09 to 22.71 ?? 24.56 items/g wet weight. The abundance of MPs exponentially increased with decreasing MP size. The MPs were dominated by fibers in terms of shape, black-gray and blue-green in terms of color and cellophane in terms of composition. MPs were found in the gills and guts of the crabs, but not in the muscles. The abundance and size of the MPs in the guts were significantly higher than those in the gills, but there was no significant difference in color or shape. In addition, crab eating patterns have a significant impact on the abundance of MPs in different species. The abundance of MPs in the saprophytic crabs was significantly higher than that in the predatory crabs. MP contamination in crabs is worthy of attention for human health and the stability of marine ecosystems. ?? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

This study employs LCA to assess environmental impacts of alternative scenarios for residual municipal solid waste (MSW) management in New South Wales (NSW) based on current conditions and policies. Six different scenarios including a baseline scenario (landfilling) were applied for NSW waste management for energy production and their impacts on environment. The initial results showed that the scenario 3 that employed anaerobic digestion for food waste, incineration for combustible waste and plastic waste, and landfilling for non-combustible waste produced electricity of 625 kWh/t, which was maximum compared to the other scenarios. LCA results further suggested that among all scenarios, scenario 5 (similar to scenario 3 except combustible waste was treated through gasification and plastic waste was recycled) has the lowest level of environmental burdens in global warming, freshwater and marine ecotoxicity, and human non-carcinogenic toxicity. The sensitivity analysis for energy conversion rates (23?€?30%) for incineration and plastic recycling rate (66?€?91.3%) for MSW was further conducted and the results showed that energy conversion rate of 30% makes scenario 3 more valuable for electricity generation and less impactful for ecosystems damage category compared to scenario 5. On the other hand, plastic recycling rate of 91.3% has the lowest environmental burdens and by decreasing recycling rate to 66% the environmental impacts increase; however, it was noticed that reduction in recycling rate does not make any change in the order of scenarios. Overall, the study suggests that each waste type in NSW should be treated with a specific technology to achieve the highest resource recovery and lowest environmental impacts where energy conversion and plastic recycling rates have significant impacts. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant
CC6XHSPG,10.1002/app.50267,Low surface energy self-polishing polymer grafted MWNTs for antibacterial coating and controlled-release property of Cu2O,"Marine biofouling had been a headache when engaging in marine activities. The most effective and convenient method for dealing with this problem was to apply antifouling coatings. But now a single anti-fouling system was hard to satisfy the requirement of anti-fouling simultaneously. Therefore, it was particularly important to develop novel multi-system anti-fouling technology. In the work, a novel polymer coatings with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) segments in the main chain and hydrolysable side chain was designed and synthesized which showed low surface energy and self-polishing performance, and then we creatively covalently immobilized the polyurethane on the surface of multi-carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to form multisystem antifouling coating. The results showed that the polymer coating would produce hydrolysable regions in the hydrophobic PDMS segment to endure the polymer coating hydrophobic and hydrolysis properties when contacted with water. In addition, the self-polishing rate and the surface energy could be regulated by varying its copolymerization, and the addition of MWNTs could kill the microorganisms and endowed the polymer coating itself enhanced antibacterial effect. Furthermore, considering the high specific surface area and physicochemical characteristics of MWNTs, it could be combined with antifoulant Cu2O through a polar or non-polar combination as a carrier to control the release rate of Cu2O in coatings. ?? 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",irrelevant
56B3WSTG,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144495,Comparative study of three sampling methods for microplastics analysis in seawater,"Microplastics, as an emerging pollutant, are widely spread in the oceans. The sampling method is the most basic and important factor affecting the reported microplastic abundance data. Three sampling methods, most commonly used for microplastic collection, including direct filtration with 0.45 ??m pore size membrane, 20 ??m sieve pre-concentration followed by 0.45 ??m filtration and Manta trawling with a 150 ??m mesh size net were studied. The results showed that there were orders of magnitude difference in abundance of microplastic across the three methods with 0.45 ??m direct filtration yielding 1600.0?€?4000.0 items/m3, 20 ??m sieve pre-concentration yielding 10.0?€?50.0 items/m3, and 150 ??m trawl net yielding 0.13?€?0.24 items/m3. The polymer types of microplastic collected by the three methods were similar, but polymer proportions were different. PES and rayon dominated in the samples collected by direct filtration and sieve pre-concentration. PES and PP accounted for a higher proportion in the trawling samples. The abundance and polymer types of microplastics had a clear correlation between direct filtration and sieve pre-concentration (p &lt; 0.05). More microplastic shapes were found in trawling samples. The average and median sizes of microplastics increased with increasing pore or mesh size. According to the size fraction and standard deviation of microplastic size in different samples of each method, the stability of method decreased with increasing pore or mesh size. The trawling method had a higher sampling efficiency, but its stability was weaker than the other two methods. Our results suggested that an appropriate method should be selected upon actual sampling condition and available tools during the research process to improve the credibility of the results. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",relevant

Various compositional ratios of HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDT metabolites improved our understanding of the sources and transport pathways of OCPs. The total absence of DDT may be a ?€?ghost indicator?€? of no recent DDT inputs into the oceans. There could well be inputs of DDT, but only as the degraded metabolites DDE and DDD when they are adsorbed to seafloor plastic litter. A comparison of HCH isomer ratios in seafloor plastics with technical HCH ratios revealed that HCHs were possibly not from early residues but from later inputs. An ecological risk assessment of the contaminants indicated a high risk from ???DDTs, p,p-DDE, and ??-HCH in all the sampled locations. Finally, we propose a descriptive model depicting the movements and transportation of PCBs and OCPs from the ocean surface to seafloor plastics in the NSCS. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",relevant

In this study, the structural properties of aged polystyrene (PS) MPs being exposed to UV/H2O, UV/H2O2 and UV/Cl2 artificially accelerated oxidation processes and related sorption behaviors of bisphenol A (BPA) on those virgin/aged PS were investigated. The surface oxidation and hydrophilicity of aged PS were significantly increased according to infrared spectroscopy (IR) and water contact angle (CA) measurements. The differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) revealed apparent degradation of aged PS especially in their amorphous domain. Obviously deteriorative BPA sorption capacity on aged PS was observed compared with that of virgin PS. The sorption rates of BPA on aged PS were accelerated and sorption of BPA shifted from partition dominant mechanism on virgin PS to the adsorption dominant mechanism through being fitted with the dual-mode sorption model. Besides, ageing in UV/Cl2 system introduces C?€?Cl groups on the surface of PS which strengthen the combination with BPA through halogen bonding interaction. Salt and dissolved organic matters (DOM) in marine water may increase the BPA sorption on aged MPs due to enhanced polar interaction. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

According to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the use of face masks is essential for slowing down the transmission rate of COVID-19 in human beings. This pandemic has generated a substantial increase in the use, as well as in the production, of face masks and other elements (gloves, face protectors, protective suits, safety shoes) manufactured with polymeric materials, including antiviral textiles most of which will end as microplastic pools. Focusing on South America, the use and mismanagement of this type of personal protective equipment (PPE) represents an environmental problem. Added to this issue are the increase in the use of single-use plastic, and the reduction of plastic recycling due to the curfew generated by the pandemic, further aggravating plastic pollution on coasts and beaches. Recently, researchers have developed antiviral polymeric textile technology composed of Ag and Cu nanoparticles for PPE to reduce the contagion and spread of COVID-19. Antiviral polymeric textile wastes could also have long-term negative repercussions on aquatic environments, as they are an important emerging class of contaminants. For this reason, this work provides reflections and perspectives on how the COVID-19 pandemic can aggravate plastic pollution on beaches and coastal environments, consequently increasing the damage to marine species in the coming years.

Larvae were exposed to 20 ??g/L of microplastic fragments or 20 and 100 ??g/L of TPhP or a combination of both for 7 days. The results showed that the three microplastics did not affect the larval locomotor activity. For TPhP, the larval moving duration and distance moved were significantly decreased by the TPhP exposure, with a maximum decrease of 43.5% and 59.4% respectively. Exposure to 100 ??g/L TPhP respectively down-regulated the expression levels of sine oculis homeobox homologue 3 (six3) and short wavelength-sensitive type 2 (sws2) by 19.1% and 41.7%, suggesting that TPhP might disturb eye development and photoreception and consequently the low locomotor activity in the larvae. Interestingly, during the binary mixture exposure, the presence of PS, PS-COOH or PS-NH2 reversed the low locomotor activity induced by 100 ??g/L TPhP to the normal level. Relative to the larvae from the 100 ??g/L TPhP group, the movement duration and distance moved were increased by approximately 60% and 100%, respectively, in the larvae from the TPhP + PS, TPhP + PS-COOH and TPhP + PS-NH2 groups. However, the gene expression profiles were distinct among the fish from the TPhP + PS, TPhP + PS-COOH and TPhP + PS-NH2 groups, implying different mechanisms underlying the reversal of the locomotor activity. The findings in this study challenge the general view that microplastics aggravate the toxicity of the adsorbed pollutants, and help better understand the environmental risk of microplastic pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

However, it is still a challenge to fabricate coating with excellent antifouling performance and superior mechanical stability. Here, we report a bio-based amphiphilic hydrogel coating with excellent antifouling and mechanical properties. The coating was achieved by the in-situ formation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interpenetrating polymer network (IPN). The hydrophobic part from a synthesized silicon-containing epoxy resin contributes to superior mechanical properties including high tensile strength and excellent adhesion of 5B. While the hydrophilic hydrogel part from the cross-linking of a hydrophilic polymer with AgNPs gives excellent antifouling properties, resist to proteins, bacteria, algae, and other marine organisms. The antifouling performance of the coating was evaluated by the attachment of proteins (BSA-FITC), bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis), and Algae (Navicula torguatum and Phaeodactylum tricornutum). The results show that the bio-based amphiphilic hydrogel coating (e.g. SA-1-5) endows surface with excellent resistance to the fouling of proteins, bacteria and microorganisms. The overall antifouling and mechanical properties of the amphiphilic coating was also evaluated by field test in East China Sea from June 3rd 2020 to July 17th 2020 that the bio-based amphiphilic hydrogel coating was intact and almost no marine organisms attached.

In this present work, for the first time we have reported the enhanced antifouling performance on the substrate, combined with cured epoxy (CE), unsaturated polyester (UP), and organically changed montmorillonite (OMMT) blends. The newly developed CE-UP-OMMT materials were submerged into the real time marine environment with the other samples of glass, plastic, fibre (broadly used in the ship hull), and wood. Since the contact angle is increased, the surface energy is decreased to the epoxy toughened blend incorporated with clay and thus showing enhanced antibacterial and antifouling properties. It provides promising results in 1 and 3 wt% clay incorporated epoxy with 10 wt% UP composite blends which improved antibacterial and antifouling performance during the microbial and macro-fouling activity in the real-time marine environment for around three months.

MANE3FW7,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144165,Cigarette butts as a microfiber source with a microplastic level of concern,"Microplastic pollution is a growing environmental concern among the scientific community. These small particles (<5 mm) might come from the fragmentation or direct emission of artificial and synthetic polymers. Among them, the microfibers (MF) are one of the most common types of microplastics identified in the environment. On the other hand, the most encountered type of garbage found in clean-up campaigns is the cigarette butts, which contains the smoked filters (SF) and unsmoked rests of tobacco. SFs are hazardous debris but are usually not properly disposed as such, and are composed of >15,000 strands that can be detached as MFs. This study aims to evaluate the detachment rate, the acute aquatic toxicity, and the aquatic-, thermooxidative-, and photo-degradability of the MFs generated from SFs. In this way, it was found that SFs detach approximately 100 small MFs (<0.2 mm) per day. In a rough estimation, about 0.3 million tons of potential MFs might be annually reaching aquatic environments from this source. Concerning the eco-toxicity, a statistically significant difference was found when MFs are present in the leachate generated by the SFs, where the Daphnia magna EC100 and EC50 were of 0.620 SF/L and 0.017 SF/L, respectively. Finally, the degradability of the SFs was evaluated by applying two methods (ATR-FTIR analysis and gravimetry). In both of them, a low degradability rate was observed. Thus, it may be concluded that MFs from SFs constitute an important source of microplastics, which might partially explain the high concentration of artificial polymers that have been found in the deep-sea sediments. Yet, the correct management of the SFs is an unsolved issue that should receive urgent attention.

The MP (&lt;5 mm) abundance and distribution in the urbanized section of the Vistula River were examined. Samples were collected from three different sites: 1) the less urbanized part of the city, 2) the area close to the tributary outlet and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and 3) the city centre. The abundance of MPs in water ranged from 1.6 to 2.55 items L???1, whereas in the sediments, it varied from 190 to 580 items kg???1. The highest MP concentration was observed in the water collected in the city centre. However, in the case of sediments, the most polluted sample was collected from a sampling point located near the WWTP and tributary outlet. The diversity of the MPs abundance along the river was associated with the hydrological and sedimentological conditions, which was confirmed by the grain size analysis of sediments. The dominant type of MPs in both the water and sediment samples was fibre. The MPs were characterized by Raman spectroscopy as polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and a variety of other materials with different levels of deterioration. The images obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed different disintegration features. Moreover, the SEM analyses revealed the occurrence of adhered particles and diatoms on the surface of MPs. The adsorption of various elements onto the MPs surface and the adhered particles was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The conducted studies emphasized the significance of the impact of large urban agglomerations, such as the Warsaw metropolitan area, on the concentration of MPs in rivers. Further studies are needed to better assess, for instance, the precise mode through which MPs in urban regions are transported by rivers to the seas. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

However, the chloride ions in sea sand corrode steel bars, posing a safety risk to concrete structures. Fibre-reinforced polymer bars, which have a high strength and are lightweight and chloride corrosion-resistant, are used instead of steel bars to avoid chloride corrosion. In this study, the dynamic bond behaviour of fibre-wrapped basalt fibre-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars embedded in SSRAC was evaluated via high-strain rate pull-out tests. Ten loading rates were applied to assess the effects of static, seismic, and impact loads on the bond performance. The damage characteristics of the concrete?€?BFRP bar interface were analysed, and the bond mechanism was ascertained. The characteristics of the bond stress?€?slip curves were examined, and the effects of the strain rate on the bond strength, slip, and stiffness were investigated. Finally, formulae describing the dynamic effects of these factors on the bond strength, slip, and stiffness were proposed to predict the dynamic bond behaviour. The findings presented herein can guide the application and development of BFRP bar-reinforced SSRAC structures and provide a theoretical basis and experimental support for dynamic design methods to enhance their bond performance. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

Moreover, links between MP deposition and meteorological factors (air humidity, wind speed, precipitation height, and air mass trajectories) were investigated. MP deposition samples were collected in the southern Baltic area in 2017 and 2018 for 286 days in total. The morphological features of MPs (shape and size) were analysed using a digital microscope. Qualitative analysis was performed using micro-attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (??ATR FT-IR). The size of the deposited MPs ranged from 5 ??m to 5000 ??m, and smaller size classes (&lt;720 ??m) were predominant (70%). Fibres were of the dominant type (60%). Films and fragments constituted 26% and 14% of the total MPs, respectively, while 55% of the MPs found in the study were polymers often used in textiles, packaging materials, and fishing gear (polyesters and polypropylene). The atmospheric MP deposition ranged from 0 m???2??d???1 to 30 m???2??d???1 (average: 10 ?? 8 m???2??d???1; median: 8 m???2??d???1). Based on the air mass trajectory cluster analysis, MPs deposited in Gdynia mainly originated from local sources (&lt;100 km). Furthermore, higher MP deposition occurred when the inflowing air masses were terrestrial, and lower deposition occurred when they were marine. On average, during wet periods twice the amount of MPs was deposited in comparison with dry periods. During dry periods deposition increased with increasing wind speed and was intensified by high relative humidity. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",relevant

The litter abundance, density and weighted average by abundance were evaluated in eight main categories: plastics, cloths/fabrics, glass, metals, rubber, processed lumber, other and large. Field surveys provided evidence that plastic represented 95% of all litter. ML abundance was treated as an ?€?environmental variable?€? and used to determine its anomalies, temporal trends and forecasts.

To assess and manage microplastic contaminants, their quantitative detection in environmental samples is a high priority. However, uncertainties of current methods still exist when estimating their abundances, particularly with fine-grained (<1 mm) microplastics. This work reports a novel thermoanalytical method for quantifying microplastics by measuring the contents of microplastic-derived carbon (MPC) in samples under the premise of nearly eliminating the limit of their particle appearances. After validating the method via samples with the spiked microplastics, we have conducted a case study on sediment core H43 that spanned 1925?€?2009 CE from the Yellow Sea for further illustrating the high reliability and practicability of this method for quantifying microplastics in natural samples.

In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the published literature to examine the impacts of MNPs on growth, photosynthesis, pigments, and metabolism of aquatic microalgae. MNPs negatively affected growth of microalgae but usually had a high EC50 (&gt; 25 mg/L). However, positively charged MNPs had a much lower EC50 (&lt; 1 mg/L). MNPs lowered maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) with the effect increasing with concentration of MNPs but diminishing with exposure time, and also reduced chlorophyll a content to enhanced extent with increased MNPs concentration. MNPs induced relatively higher changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in marine algae than in freshwater algae. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increased with MNPs concentration and exposure time while SOD levels first increased and then decreased with increasing MNPs concentration. Macrophytes were found to be able to trap MNPs via multiple mechanisms. Future work should focus on the mechanisms behind MNPs impacts on primary productivity and global carbon cycle, and the combined effects of MNPs with other environmental factors. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Small microplastic particles, with an upper size limit of 20 ??m, have been identified as having the highest potential for causing damage to marine ecosystems. Having accurate methods for quantifying the abundance of such particles in a natural environment is essential for defining the extent of the problem they pose. Using an optical micro-Raman tweezers setup, we have identified the composition of particles trapped in marine aggregates collected from the coastal surface waters around the subtropical island of Okinawa. Chemical composition analysis at the single-particle level indicates dominance by low-density polyethylene, which accounted for 75% of the small microplastics analysed.

Our results show the occurrence of plastics at all test sites, with the highest concentration in areas with high human activities. We also observed additional Raman peaks on the plastics spectrum with decreasing debris size which could be related to structural modification due to weathering or embedding in organic matter.

However, plastic contamination in wild derived fishmeal, a globally traded commodity, remains unknown. Using a global sampling approach, this study is the first one to assess the plastic content and composition in commercial fishmeal products. The sampling consisted of 26 different fishmeal products, originating from 11 countries on four continents and Antarctica, and representing the vast majority of globally available and traded commercial products. A wide range of plastics content was found, ranging from 0 to 526.7 n kg-1, and a relatively higher plastics content was identified in fishmeal obtained from China (337.5??34.5 n kg-1) and Morocco (253.3??43.4 n kg???1), whereas no plastics was detected in krill meal obtained from Antarctica. The risk assessment based on feed conversion ratio (FCR) showed that the carnivorous fish species (e.g. eel) with a high percentage of dietary fishmeal, have a substantially higher risk for plastic intake, than other species. In conclusion, these results indicate that fishmeal can be an important pathway for plastics to enter the seafood chain. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Many studies are exploring ways of removing these particles from marine environments such as seas and oceans. Here, we present a superhydrophobic surface obtained by combining anodisation and the liquid-phase deposition of lauric acid. The superhydrophobic surface was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to elucidate its hierarchical structure and wetting state, while time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) were applied to identify the chemical composition of the surface, which revealed that aluminium laurate decreased the surface free energy. As microplastics are usually found in saline water, it was important to study the anticorrosion properties of the surface. Polarisation curves of the anodised surface showed excellent anticorrosion properties in 3.5 wt% NaCl aqueous solution, which was enhanced by the superhydrophobic properties when the aluminium surface was anodised for 60 min. The functionalised surface was superhydrophobic (154??) and superoleophilic (0??). These wetting properties allowed the surface to remove microplastics from the NaCl aqueous solution with an efficiency higher than 99%.

However, leaching kinetics of inherent contaminants from ingested MPs are poorly studied. The present study characterized the leaching kinetics of PBDEs from sub-millimeter sized MPs in fish oil at relevant body temperatures for marine organisms and assessed exposure risk of MPs for cod fish by a biodynamic model.

At present, most studies focused on the short-term performance of strengthened RC beams with a prestressed CFRP plate, and very limited information is available on their durability, which is of importance in certain cases, such as high-piled wharfs and bridges in marine environments. This study investigates the effects of chloride environment exposure on the flexural performance of strengthened RC beams with self-anchored prestressed CFRP plates. In total, seven RC beams, four of which were strengthened by a self-anchored prestressed CFRP plate, were fabricated and tested under three-point bending. The testing parameters included 25% and 40% prestress level of the ultimate tensile strength of the CFRP plate, 5% and 10% tensile steel rebar corrosion ratio of mass loss and 10% and 20% anchor corrosion ratio in the chloride environment. The evolution of time-dependent prestress losses in the strengthened beam was determined, and the flexural behaviour of the strengthened beams was analysed. A theoretical model is proposed to predict the flexural strength of prestressed CFRP strengthened RC beams in a chloride environment. The experimental results indicated that the coupling of the corrosion expansion of the metal anchor and rebar in the chloride environment had a large negative effect on the flexural performance of the beams strengthened by the self-anchored prestressed CFRP plates. After exposure to the chloride ion solution, the failure mode of the RC beams strengthened by the prestressed CFRP changed from concrete crushing in the compression section to anchor pullout. The proposed model, which considered the effect of a chloride environment to predict the flexural strength of the strengthened beams, agreed well with the test results. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

The most frequent microplastic morphology was the fragment type in the size range of 100 to 250 ??m, and the predominant colours were white/transparent and red. Measurement uncertainty of the visual microplastic counts showed that black colour microplastics is more susceptible to be mistaken, which might lead to an underestimation and/or overestimation of the total number of microplastics. Polypropylene and polyethylene together comprised most of the polymer types (98%). Micro-Fourier transform infrared (micro-FTIR) spectroscopy analyses showed that 58% of the analysed polymers were highly oxidised, indicating long residence of this particles in the water. In addition, our data show that the distribution of microplastics is strongly influenced by the geohydrological characteristics of the lake. Therefore, this research may provide information for further investigations of microplastic distribution in Lake Gua??ba and can serve as a base to improve the regulations regarding waste management to effectively reduce microplastic pollution in freshwater systems. Additionally, the measurement uncertainty showed that black microplastics are more susceptible to variations in their measurements. ?? 2020",irrelevant

Depauperate fouling communities on marine litter in the hyper-oligotrophic South Pacific Subtropical Gyre,"The hyper-oligotrophic waters of the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre (SPSG) and the productive coastal Humboldt Current System (HCS) constitute an extreme nutrient gradient in the eastern South Pacific Ocean. Rich and dense fouling communities are known from floating objects in the HCS, but they have not been studied in the SPSG and it is not known which factors are influencing their richness and abundance. Here we present the first extensive study of rafting by marine invertebrates on floating anthropogenic debris in the eastern SPSG. We compared the effect of 9 raft-related categorical predictors on epibiont richness and fouling cover. Raft complexity was the most important predictor of richness. Fouling was dominated by thin crusts and biofilms, with more advanced communities only observed on few items. Fouling cover could not be predicted by any of the categorical factors tested. However, when tested as continuous predictors, raft volume and surface area were significantly correlated with both cover and richness. The most frequently encountered epibionts were common pelagic rafters, particularly Lepas spp., Planes spp., and Jellyella spp. Low fouling cover suggests that the SPSG's hyper-oligotrophic conditions strongly limit fouling growth, while the low frequency of coastal taxa points to the HCS/SPSG nutrient gradient acting as a filter for such organisms. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",uncertain

Here, the effects of two particle sizes (2 and 200 ??m) of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) on the gut microbiota of medaka were evaluated following oral administration at 0.3 and 3.0 ??g/mg for 28 days. No change in body length and gut histopathology damage were observed. However, the exposure to PS-MPs significantly decreased fish body weight and disrupted the liver anti-oxidative status. The PS-MPs caused a shift in the gut microbial structure of medaka accompanied by changes in community function, including significant environmental stress, increased carbon degradation/fixation activities, and partially modified nitrogen/phosphorus/sulfur metabolic abilities. Furthermore, the PS-MPs exposure disturbed the glycolipid/tyrosine/energy metabolism and the endocrine balance. A potential correlation between the gut microecology and host response to PS-MPs exposure was also observed. These results indicated that the PS-MPs may contribute to gut-liver axis disruption, which could be the underlying toxicological mechanisms of PS-MPs exposure. This work has improved our knowledge about the relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and host metabolic disorders following MPs exposure. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

However, FRP bars do not have strong ribs for bonding, and thus, may have weaker bonds compared to steel reinforcing bars. To overcome this problem, the addition of fibres and expansive agent to concrete to induce gripping stresses on FRP bars may be a feasible solution. In this research, the effects of glass fibres and expansive agent on the bond behaviour of glass/basalt FRP bars cast in SSSC were studied by conducting pull-out tests with varying fibre content, fibre length, and expansive agent content. The results revealed that although the addition of glass fibres and/or the expansive agent significantly increases the bond stiffness, it only marginally increases the bond strength of the FRP bars. Overall, the addition of both fibres and the expansive agent offers certain synergistic effects; however, improving the bond strength is still difficult owing to the premature failure of the FRP bars. Finally, constitutive models to simulate the bond behaviour of FRP bars in SSSC were proposed. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

Predation of microplastics by microzooplankton,"Protozoans play an integral role in the microbial loop, an important process of material and energy transfer in marine ecosystems. The number of microplastics in the marine environment has greatly increased, but the potential impacts of small nanoplastics and microplastics on marine organisms remain unclear. Here, we conducted a series of feeding experiments with various concentrations of microplastic beads (ca. 1 ??m) to characterize the response of the planktonic ciliated protozoan Strombidium sulcatum to microplastics and a set of additional exposure experiments with four different particle diameters of microplastics to explore whether the feeding response exhibited size selectivity. As the microplastic concentration increased, the number, body size, and biomass of ciliates decreased sharply during the exposure period. Predator biomass in all microplastic treatments was markedly reduced relative to the microplastic-free control. For example, at 72 h of exposure, the biomass in the highest microplastic concentration treatment was observed to decrease by 96.59% relative to the control. There was no obvious difference in the biomass of ciliates exposed to various diameters of microplastics; however, compared with the free bead control, the biomass still significantly decreased. These findings suggest that microplastics in the ocean negatively affect the growth of protozoan microzooplankton that might have accidentally ingested these tiny particles during the feeding process. Generally, this study provides basic and novel data for understanding the effect of microplastics on the microbial loop in marine ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

A case study on the marine ciliate Uronema marinum,"Microplastic debris has become a significant global environmental issue. Yet, the effects on ingestion of microplastics by protozoan grazers?€?an important link in the microbial loop?€?are scant. Feeding experiments were conducted with the free-living marine ciliate Uronema marinum grazing on cultured bacteria Pseudoaltermonas sp., exposing them to different concentrations or sizes of polystyrene beads for 96 h. The number of beads decreased during exposure experiments. Under the microplastic influence, the ciliate cells were observed to decrease in abundance, body size, and biomass. It was noted that the ciliate biomass in the highest microplastic density treatment was significantly lower than that in the control (98.1% lower) and that microplastics can be ingested by ciliate protozoa which performed an important role in the transportation of energy across the microbial loop. Moreover, carbon biomass of ciliates exposed to microplastics of different particle diameters decreased significantly compared to the control. However, this effect does not seem to vary depending on microplastic sizes. This study is a first step in providing experimental insight into the feeding relationship between microplastics and marine protozoan grazers.

Relative to macro-sized plastics, these small particles are of special concern due to their potential impact on marine, freshwater, and terrestrial systems. While microplastic (MP) pollution has been widely studied in geographic regions globally, many questions remain about its origins. It is assumed that urban environments are the main contributors but systematic studies are lacking. The absence of standard methods to characterize and quantify MPs and smaller particles in environmental and biological matrices has hindered progress in understanding their geographic origins and sources, distribution, and impact. Hence, the development and standardization of methods is needed to establish the potential environmental and human health risks. In this study, we investigated stable carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), attenuated total reflectance - Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and micro-Raman spectroscopy (??-Raman) as complementary techniques for characterization of common plastics. Plastic items selected for comparative analysis included food packaging, containers, straws, and polymer pellets. The ability of IRMS to distinguish weathered samples was also investigated using the simulated weathering conditions of ultraviolet (UV) light and heat. Our IRMS results show a difference between the ??13C values for plant-derived and petroleum-based polymers. We also found differences between plastic items composed of the same polymer but from different countries, and between some recycled and nonrecycled plastics. Furthermore, increasing ??13C values were observed after exposure to UV light. The results of the three techniques, and their advantages and limitations, are discussed. ?? 2020",irrelevant

Our numerical approach is based on the nonconforming Crouzeix-Raviart finite element. An advantage of this element is that it facilitates the coupling to an ocean model that employs an Arakawa C-type staggering of variables. We show that the Crouzeix-Raviart element implements a discretization of the viscous-plastic and elastic-viscous-plastic stress tensor that suffers from unacceptable small scale noise in the velocity field. To resolve this issue we introduce an edge-based stabilization of the Crouzeix-Raviart element. Through a blend of theoretical considerations, based on the Korn inequality, and numerical experiments we show that the stabilized Crouzeix-Raviart element provides a stable discretization of sea-ice dynamics on triangular grids that is relevant for sea-ice modelling in ocean and climate science. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",irrelevant

This method involves ultrasound-assisted extraction coupled with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. All of the variables included in the extraction process, such as the extraction time and type and solvent volume, were studied and optimised.

However, reports of microplastics from glaciers are rare, especially for the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is widely known as the world's Third Pole and Asian Water Tower. Adjacent to human settlements in South Asia, East China, and Central Asia, the TP features regular cross-border air pollution (e.g., black carbon and mercury), which can affect its vulnerable and pristine environments. In previous studies, abundant microplastics have been reported from Tibetan rivers/lakes water and sediments, and surface soils. We detected microplastics in glacier surface snow on the TP, which were isolated from the impact of human activities, indicating that microplastics can be transported over long distances. This evidence is expected to be significant for understanding the atmospheric transport of microplastics to the TP, and provides a global perspective on the microplastic cycle. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Their identification in samples in terms of quantity and pathways remain a challenge as contamination can be a major source of error. A systematic study of synthetic microfibers (MFs) has been carried out in different environmental compartments of an urban area and in the surface waters of the northwestern Mediterranean. The quantity, size and type of polymer of MFs were recorded in air, in waste water from a domestic washing machine, at the inlet and outlet of the Haliotis urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Nice (Provence Alpes C??te-d'Azur, France) and in a variety of coastal and offshore areas. The results showed that MFs released by clothes during washing (on average of 13 ?? 106 MFs per m3) are an important emitter of microplastics. Despite its high removal efficiency (87.5% to 98.5%) by Haliotis, a large number of MFs, estimated at 4.3 billion, enter the marine environment daily from the treatment plant. The attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) characterization of the raw materials showed that 14 to 50% of fibers are synthetic, mostly polyester and polyamide, the remaining 35 to 72% being natural polymers (cotton, wool) or manufactured by processing natural polymers (especially cellulose).

5XJXJKX6,10.1016/j.trgeo.2020.100472,Geotechnical characterization of plastic waste materials in pavement subgrade applications,"Scarcity of traditional construction materials has motivated researchers to explore alternatives, and besides crushed glass, reclaimed asphalt pavement, and scrap tires, to name a few, plastic waste (unwanted or unusable plastic objects) has also gained attention in recent years. Plastic waste is traditionally re-used or recycled, but it often ends up as trash on curbsides, in landfills, or in our seas and oceans. The substantial amount of plastic waste produced annually worldwide, and its environmental repercussions are the rationale for exploring alternatives in order to recycle plastic waste into construction materials. This exploration can also benefit many industries and would help minimising adverse environmental impacts associated with dumping tones of plastic waste in landfills. Using plastic waste material with soil for soil reinforcement purposes has revealed some improvements in terms of strengths of materials, but nevertheless, this potentiality has not been fully assessed for different types and forms of plastic waste with natural subgrade soil in the road industry. In this paper, ground, flaky, and pelleted shapes of four sorted types of plastic waste from a recycling market were combined with silty or clayey gravel and sand soil of the A-2-7 AASHTO type. These plastic types are: low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), and polypropylene (PP) resins. Their various geotechnical properties have been assessed thoroughly. The investigation process entails assessing compaction, Californian Bearing Ratio (CBR), strength, resilient modulus, and permeability properties for both natural sub-grade soil and modified sub-grade soil with the aforementioned types of plastic waste. The results obtained show that the addition of plastic wastes decrease the maximum dry densities of the subgrade soils because of the lower relative density of the plastic material compared to the soil particles. It is also found that the addition of plastic wastes can increase or decrease the CBR and MR values of the subgrade. The nature of change (increase or decrease) and its magnitude are a function of the plastic content, shape and type. Permeability values of many subgrade soil samples increased with the addition of plastic waste, whereas the hydraulic conductivity of some soils modified with plastic remained unchanged. Subgrade soils with plastic had higher friction angle and lower compressive strength than plastic-free soils. The results of this research suggest that partial replacement of subgrade soil material with plastic waste may prove useful in road subgrade applications. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

So far, research activities have mainly focused on the occurrence of microplastics (MP) in marine habitats, while little is known about their distribution and composition in the terrestrial environment. Agricultural practices such as fertilization, mulching or ensilage make agriculture a likely path for MP into the environment. Here, we collected soil samples at 15 farmland locations in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany, to study the amount, distribution and composition of MP in the size range between 1 and 5 mm. In total, 379 MP were identified in a total of 84 kg of dry weight (DW).

The high popularity of composites and safety requirements results in the development of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems. One of the sensors types that can be permanently integrated with a composite structure and used as a part of SHM system are fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Among FBG sensors advantages small size, high corrosion resistance, and absence of electric current are especially important in monitoring of composite marine structures. The paper presents an application of embedded FBG sensors arrays for evaluation of complex composite structure ?€? a fast patrol boat. The experimental investigations contain spectra analyses for thin laminate sample (skin), a composite sandwich panel and fast patrol boat hull (sandwich structure). The quality of sensors spectra (before/after embedding and loading) was determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The relationship between strain and temperature in exploitation range was determined for laminate and sandwich structures. A linear relationship was achieved for both elements. The relationship for the sandwich panel was then applied during strain analyses of the boat composite hull. The utility of designed FBG sensors array for the panel was also verified by sensors responses on impact excitation in chosen points on the structure. The achieved results were then used during designing FBG sensors array embedded into the hull.

This fracture was unexpected and, due to the geology in the North Sea no obvious explanation could be found. In our study, we adopt the hypothesis that the Hugin fracture was formed by differential compaction controlled by glacial load. We construct a simplified 2D geomechanical model partly covered by top load (ice sheet) and test this hypothesis. We employ transient poro-elastoplastic simulation with a finite element method. For the simulations, we had to make assumptions regarding the material properties, because the fracture is located in-between well locations. We used descriptions from drilling site survey reports and literature values and performed seismic matching form well paths to the Hugin Fracture. Nearby well data were only partly useful due to incomplete logging in the first 400 m below seafloor. To overcome this problem, we introduced a mixing k-value which allows us to easily change the material properties from pure clay to sand. Changing the mixing k-value for each simulation provided information about the limits and robustness of the simulation results. Simulation results show isotropic stress and strain distribution in the horizontally layered, isotropic part of the model that is totally covered by the ice. In the central, channelized part of the model a composite stress and strain pattern develops with sub-vertical focus areas tangential to channel edges. Low stress, strain and deformation values under total load increase drastically soon after the load starts to decrease, resulting in the development of fractures along the focussed zones. Surface deformation such as formation of compaction ridges above stiff clay-filled channels and depression associated with plastic deformation is observed. A fracture and associated surface deformation develop above the shallowest sand-filled channel, very much resembling the observed geometry at the Hugin Fracture. The simulation supports the formation hypothesis for the Hugin Fracture as a compaction fracture and suggests that thin ice sheets may induce differential compaction to a depth of several hundred meters. ?? 2021, The Author(s).",irrelevant

Herein, circular CFRP/GFRP hybrid tubes and tubes, reinforced with internal composite skeletons (XS and OS), were fabricated to further enhance the energy absorption capacities. The crashworthiness and failure pattern of reinforced structures were compared with the hollow and aluminum foam-filled composite tubes. Moreover, low-velocity drop-weight impact tests were carried out to investigate the effect of hybridization design and filler types on the energy dissipation mechanism under axial compression. The experimental results revealed that the hollow composite tubes collapsed in progressive and the impact energy was absorbed by the generation of cracks, fiber fracture and friction. Also, the GFRP tubes exhibited better crashworthiness than CFRP tubes under low velocity impact, which was different from the quasi-static compression conditions. In contrast to hollow counterparts, the mean crushing force (MCF) of foam-filled tubes was improved by approximately 40%, whereas the specific energy absorption (SEA) was reduced by 30% due to the low weight efficiency of the aluminum foam. The filling of XS-skeleton divided the tube into four cells and improved the MCF by more than 10%. However, it reduced the SEA by around 8% due to unstable and inefficient deformation of XS-skeleton during crushing. By contrast, the OS-skeleton divided the hollow tube into more cells and collapsed progressively, resulting in superior energy absorption characteristics. Herein, the OS-filled GFRP tube was found to be the most crashworthy structure that improved the crushing force efficiency (CFE) and SEA by 50% and 7%, respectively. ?? 2020",irrelevant

The structural crashworthiness of the proposed design is investigated under quasi-static lateral loading. Further, the aluminum tube, the foam-filled tube and the tubes filled with CFRP skeleton are also designed and tested to perform a comparative study. It is found that the FCFT-1 (the tube filled with foam and CFRP skeleton with square cells) exhibits superior SEA (specific energy absorption), which is almost five times that of the individual aluminum tube, and almost 10% higher than that of the foam-filled tube. However, FCFT-2 (the tube filled with foam and CFRP skeleton with triangular cells) provides relatively lower energy-absorbing capacity, as its aluminum tube generates several axial cracks during crushing process leading to low deformation level of the foams. Furthermore, crush simulations are conducted to better understand the energy-absorbing mechanisms of the FCFT-1. The numerical results demonstrate that the plastic deformation of the separated foams makes up the major part of the total energy absorption. Besides, the performance improvement of FCFT-1 can be partly attributed to the fact that the separated foams generate larger plastic deformation during crushing process. Apart from this, the increased interaction effects between the separated foams and the CFRP skeleton lead to a higher FE (frictional energy), which also makes a slight contribution to the performance improvement of FCFT-1. Finally, parametric studies are performed to explore the influences of design parameters on the crashworthiness characteristics of FCFT-1. It is indicated that the energy-absorbing capacity can be slightly improved by raising cell number, proportion of 45?? layer or foam density.

In this work, the effects of BPA (0.05?€?0.5?€?5 ??M) were further investigated at different times post fertilization (24?€?28?€?32?€?48 hpf). BPA induced concentration-dependent alterations in deposition of the organic matrix and calcified shell at different larval stages, as shown by double calcofluor/calcein staining, resulting in altered phenotypes at 48hpf. Transcription of Tyrosinase-TYR, that plays a key role in remodelling of the shell organic matrix, and of HOX1, a member of homeobox genes involved in larval shell formation and neurogenesis, were evaluated by In Situ Hybrydization-ISH. BPA altered the spatial pattern of expression of both genes, with distinct effects depending on the concentration and developmental stage. Moreover, BPA affected the time course of mRNA levels for TYR from 24 to 48hpf. BPA impaired development of serotonin-5-HT-immunoreactive neurons at different times pf; at 48hpf, the reduction in the number of serotoninergic neurons was associated with developmental delay and downregulation of the 5-HT receptor-5-HTR.

The upper Khuff-equivalent, gas-hosting carbonate-evaporite succession was formed on a gently-sloping, homoclinal carbonate ramp in a warm, tropical aragonite sea under a hot-and-arid greenhouse climate. This study explores the impact of vertical variations in depositional facies and diagenetic features on the reservoir quality to improve the prediction of the subsurface facies and hydraulic flow unit distribution. Detailed core logging and petrographic analysis resulted in the recognition of twelve distinct carbonate-evaporite facies that are grouped into four major facies associations, from shallowest to deepest: supratidal to restricted subtidal, lagoon, carbonate shoal, and shallow mid-ramp. The facies associations are stacked into two long-term sequences KS2 (58 m) and KS1 (77 m) bounded by anhydrites and/or unconformities; three higher frequency sequences (KS1a, KS1b, and KS1c) can be identified within the KS1. Based on the petrophysical properties, sedimentary facies characteristics and their diagenetic modifications, five hydraulic flow units (HFUs) are identified, with the best porosity-permeability values and flow- and storage capacities in the late transgressive (TSTs) and the earliest highstand systems tracts (HSTs) of the two long-term sequences. The reservoir quality and the distribution of hydraulic flow units are a product of interactions between primary mineralogy, depositional facies and their stacking, and the early- and late-diagenetic alterations. The reservoir quality decreases in landward direction, being the lowest in the mud-supported textures of the lagoon and supratidal to restricted subtidal facies associations. The seaward improvement in reservoir quality reflects a change to grain-supported textures that formed along the tide-and wave-agitated ooid-bioclastic shoals, whereas the best reservoir quality characterizes the shallow mid-ramp open-marine facies association, where secondary porosity was improved by dissolution and dolomitization.

XTA2PJVL,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143987,A probabilistic risk assessment of microplastics in soil ecosystems,"Plastics have a variety of applications due to their versatility, relative cost, and strength-to-weight ratio, and resistance to degradation. As a result, plastic waste can be found in all corners of the Earth. A class of plastic contaminants that have received increasing attention in terms of their potential impact on ecosystems is microplastics (???5 mm). The greatest attention to date has been on their potential effect in marine ecosystems. However, a growing number of studies are examining their potential impact on soil ecosystems. The data reported in the literature on the environmentally-relevant concentrations of microplastics in soils and the concentration of microplastics that causes an adverse effect in soil biota were used to perform a probabilistic risk assessment of microplastics to soil biota. An environmental exposure distribution was constructed from the concentrations of microplastics reported in soil in the literature. Species sensitivity distributions were constructed using concentration of microplastics in soil that had no adverse effect on soil species (NOEC) or the lowest concentrations that had an adverse effect on soil species (LOEC) reported in the literature. The 95th centile of the environmental exposure distribution (8147 microplastic particles per gram of soil) was greater than 22 and 28% of the species sensitivity distribution constructed using NOECs and LOECs, respectively. The assessment concluded that environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics reported in the literature could pose a considerable risk to soil biota. It is also important to note that due to the continued production of large quantities of plastic and the persistence of microplastics in the environment, environmentally-relevant concentrations of microplastics in soil are likely to only rise. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant
QZXJRQWF,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143812,Plastics and sedimentation foster the spread of a non-native macroalga in seagrass meadows,"Plastics are found in marine environments worldwide, and their effects on macrophytes (seagrasses and macroalgae) colonizing sandy bottoms are still poorly known. Seagrass meadows are valuable but declining ecosystems due to local and global-change related stressors, including sediment disturbance and introduced macroalgae. Understanding whether plastics pose a further threat to seagrasses is critically important. In two simultaneous additive experiments performed in an aquaculture tank, we examined the individual and combined effects of macroplastics (non-biodegradable high-density polyethylene and biodegradable starch-based) and sedimentation (no and repeated sedimentation) on the performance (in terms of biomass and architectural variables) of a native Mediterranean seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) and an introduced macroalga (Caulerpa cylindracea), and on the intensity of their interactions. Macroplastics were still present in sediments after 18 months. Cymodocea nodosa produced a greater biomass and longer horizontal rhizome internodes forming clones with more spaced shoots probably to escape from plastics. Plastics prevented C. nodosa to react to sedimentation by increasing vertical rhizome growth. Under C. cylindracea invasion, C. nodosa allocated more biomass to roots, particularly to fine roots. In the presence of C. nodosa, C. cylindracea performance was reduced. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic and sedimentation shifted species interactions from competitive to neutral. These results suggest that both HDPE and biodegradable starch-based macroplastics, if deposited on marine bottoms, could make seagrasses vulnerable to sedimentation and reduce plant cover within meadows. HDPE plastic and sedimentation could contribute to the decline of seagrass habitats by facilitating the spread of non-native macroalgae within meadows. Overall, the study highlights the urgent need to implement more effective post-marketing management actions to prevent a further entering of plastics in natural environments in the future, as well as to establish to conservation measures specifically tailored to protect seagrass habitats from plastic pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

In line with the micro-plastic pollution, the present contribution is devoted to the investigation of micro-plastic particles (MPs) along the urban sandy beach called Marina, the renowned longest beach in India. Along the sea coast of about 5 km, the quantification of micro-plastic particles using optical microscope evidenced the granular, filamentous, filmy and tubular fragments in a total of 72 marine samples including those filtered in the marine water column (WAT; 24 samples), those found in wet sediment (WET; 24 samples) and those found in dry sand (DSS; 24 samples). The filamentous-typed plastics of 79%, 57% and 52%, respectively in WET, WAT and DSS dominated over the other granular and tubular types. The micro-plastic particles were in the range of 60?€?820 items per m3, 60?€?1620 items per kg and 20?€?1540 items per kg for WAT, WET and DSS, respectively. The standard deviation for the microplastics abundance were 193.1, 396.6 and 364.6 for WAT, WET and DSS respectively. Upon visual inspection, the micro particles were observed in eight different colors and most of the samples were found to contain two different fragment types. Apart from the optical microscopic examination, the micro-plastics particles were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with elemental analysis by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The energy spectral graphs displayed that the micro-filaments and micro-tubular particles contained polyesters and fluoro-polymers. The presence of few micro-filaments of polypropylene and polyethylene was also evidenced from their atomic percentage values of carbon of about 88% and 93%, respectively. The presence of fluoro-polymers and polyesters was also confirmed by Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR). Excepting the fluoro-polymers, the micro-plastics particles contained elements arising from sea water (Na, Cl, S, Mg, Ca, K). Heavy metals such as Cu, Mn, Mo, Ru and Rh were observed in micro-tubular fragments. Fe and Ti elements were detected with the highest atomic percentage of 17.19 and 19.84 in micro-tubular fragments. All the observations and analyses give a photography of the nature and the spatial distribution of MPs along this Indian beach. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",relevant
YRJG3PWG,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143978,Biodegradable plastics can alter carbon and nitrogen cycles to a greater extent than conventional plastics in marine sediment,"The seabed constitutes a global sink for plastic debris, where they can remain for centuries. Biodegradable plastics offer the advantage of having less persistence in the environment than conventional ones. The seabed is responsible for key ecosystem functions related to the cycling of elements by decomposing the labile fraction of organic matter and fueling primary production, while storing the most recalcitrant part of this organic matter and limiting CO2 emissions. Although plastics are expected to affect these processes, knowledge on this matter is scarce. In controlled microcosms, we show that biodegradable plastics can stimulate the decomposition of marine-buried carbon and reduce the release of inorganic nitrogen. We found that conventional and biodegradable plastics promoted anaerobic sediment metabolic pathways. Biodegradable plastics produced a two-fold CO2 release to the water column, which suggests the decomposition of not only plastics, but also of buried organic carbon. The stimulation of sediment metabolism could be due to excessive carbon consumption by bacteria that derives from a rise in the carbon:nitrogen ratio. Accordingly, the NH4+ flux to the water column lowered. As NOx fluxes also lowered, biodegradable plastics might promote nitrification-denitrification coupling. If biodegradable plastics become a major component of marine pollution, then sediment biogeochemical cycles might be strongly influenced, which could affect the carbon sequestration of coastal ecosystems and compromise their mitigation capacity against climate change. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Yet little is known about its presence in, and implications for, freshwater ecosystems or its downstream contribution to plastic pollution in the ocean. This study documents fishing gear-related debris in one of the world's largest plastic pollution contributing river catchments, the Ganges. Riverbank surveys conducted along the length of the river, from the coast in Bangladesh to the Himalaya in India, show that derelict fishing gear density increases with proximity to the sea. Fishing nets were the main gear type by volume and all samples examined for polymer type were plastic. Illegal gear types and restricted net mesh sizes were also recorded. Socio-economic surveys of fisher communities explored the behavioural drivers of plastic waste input from one of the world's largest inland fisheries and revealed short gear lifespans and high turnover rates, lack of appropriate end-of-life gear disposal methods and ineffective fisheries regulations. A biodiversity threat assessment identified the air-breathing aquatic vertebrate species most at risk of entanglement in, and impacts from, derelict fishing gear; namely species of threatened freshwater turtle and otter, and the endangered Ganges river dolphin. This research demonstrates a need for targeted and practical interventions to limit the input of fisheries-related plastic pollution to this major river system and ultimately, the global ocean. The approach used in this study could be replicated to examine the inputs, socio-economic drivers and ecological impacts of this previously uncharacterised but important source of plastic pollution in other major rivers worldwide. ?? 2020 The Authors",irrelevant

Freshwater is the transport routes and potential sources for plastic fragments to the oceans. However, information especially about the occurrence of microplastics in freshwater systems is unclear in certain key areas. This work studied the distribution and characteristics for microplastics in the downstream area of West River. Both sediment and surface water detected microplastics with abundance ranging from 2560 to 10,240 items/kg and 2.99 to 9.87 items/L, respectively. Small size (<0.5 mm) and fiber were the main size and type in both surface waters and sediments. Polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate were the polymer types of microplastics, as identified using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. In addition, findings here might be in consideration of studying about the distribution of microplastics and the degree to which they were influenced by the use of land. In descending order, the highest microplastics abundance was observed in commercial/public/recreational > residential > industrial > natural areas. Our results indicate the occurrence of high abundance microplastics in river impacted by human activities, and suggest that spatial distribution of microplastics varies between different land use areas. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant
EEHLGTAY,10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.125823,Preparation and antifouling performance evaluation of fluorine-containing amphiphilic silica nanoparticles,"Ocean-going ships, deep-sea equipment, coastal facilities, and other underwater surfaces are often attached to and fouled by marine microorganisms, animals, and plants, leading to damage, equipment failure or major economic losses in severe cases. Therefore, it is of great significance to take measures to prevent marine biofouling. To date, no single eco-friendly technology has been developed to achieve good antifouling effects. Therefore, the combination of multiple antifouling factors is still one of the main strategies to strengthen antibiofouling performance. In this paper, amphiphilic block copolymer (PTFEMA-co-PSBMA) functionalized silica (SiO2) nanoparticles of SiO2-g-(PTFEMA-co-PSBMA) were prepared by surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP), and then they were physically blended with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix to prepare one kind of novel antifouling coating. Compared with control silicone rubber coating and bare SiO2-dopped silicone rubber coating, the experiment results show that the diatom density on the surface of the copolymer functionalized silica nanoparticle-dopped coating is reduced by approximately 30 % and 50 %, respectively. Furthermore, upon employing washing process, it is found that the highest removal rate of diatoms on the surface of the copolymer functionalized silica nanoparticle coating is 50 %, which is approximately twice the removal rate of the unmodified SiO2 silicone rubber coating. Finally, it is found that the surface of the copolymer functionalized silica nanoparticle coating still has good antifouling and fouling release properties upon encountering wear test. These above results prove that the coatings with functionalized nanosilica nanoparticles have better antifouling performance. Current strategy in this work provides a new route for developing environmentally friendly fouling-releasing antifouling coatings. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

To evaluate the intake and physiological effects of different size particles and their exposure ways, the thick shell mussels Mytilus coruscus were exposed to polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics (NPs, 70 nm) and microplastics (MPs, 10 ??m) respectively for two weeks by mixing NPs/MPs with microalgae or exposed to MNPs individually after feeding. Intake of particles and their physiological effects including energy budget, digestive enzymes and oxidative responses were assessed after exposure. Results indicated food presence mediate the effects while MPs decrease the energy budget and increase the catalase activity and malondialdehyde levels. Moreover, exposure way significantly affected energy budget and size of particle had a significant impact on enzyme activities. Our results showed MPs induce more significant effects than NPs on mussels, emphasized the importance of particle exposure way and suggested that mixture exposure with microalgae alleviate the influences on mussels caused by plastic particles alone. This study emphasized that we need to take the food particles into account for evaluating the toxic effects of plastic particles on filter feeding animals in the natural environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

In the present study, the distribution patterns of microplastics in the environment and inhabiting organisms were investigated along the east coast of Hainan Island, South China Sea, and the physiological impacts of the microplastics on scleractinian corals were analyzed. We documented average microplastic concentrations of 14.90 particles L???1 in seawater, 343.04 particles kg???1 in sediment, 4.97 particles cm???2 in corals, and 0.67?€?3.12 particles cm???1 in Tridacnidae, Trochidae and fish intestines. Further analysis revealed that the characteristics of microplastics in the organisms were different from those in the environment, indicating preferential enrichment in the organisms. Furthermore, there was an obvious correlation between microplastic concentration and symbiotic density in corals. Furthermore, caspase3 activity was significantly positively correlated with the microplastic content in the small-polyp coral Pocillopora damicornis, but the large-polyp coral Galaxea fascicularis showed higher tolerance to microplastics. Taken together, our results suggest that microplastics are selectively enriched in corals and other reef-dwellers, in which they exact differential stress (apoptotic) effects, with the potential to impact the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis and alter the coral community structure. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",relevant
4CPEAUSP,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124022,Screening of suspected micro(nano)plastics in the Ebro Delta (Mediterranean Sea),"This is the first work reporting the use of a double suspect-screening to assess most common polymers and additives in micro(nano)plastics (NPLs/MPLs) found in environmental waters. The method consisted of water filtration followed by ultrasonic-assisted extraction with toluene and analysis employing size exclusion chromatography using an advanced polymer chromatography column coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry with an atmospheric pressure photoionisation source by negative ionisation conditions (LC(APC)-APPI(???)-HRMS). The identification of NPL/MPLs polymers has been based on increasing confirmation level, including the monomers characterisation by the Kendrick Mass Defect and confirmation and quantification when standards were available. In parallel, the identification of main additives in NPL/MPLs composition, as well organic contaminants adsorbed onto the plastic particles were carried out by analysis of the extracts by LC(C18)-APPI (+/???)-HRMS. To assess the impact of plastic pollution it is necessary to assess the composition in terms of polymers but also the additives. This screening approach has been employed to study composition of NPL/MPLs in the Ebro Delta. Two sampling campaigns including freshwater and seawater samples have been investigated to assess plastic composition in the top 5 cm. Polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polyisoprene (PI), polybutadiene (PBD), polypropylene (PP) and polysiloxanes were the most detected polymers and PP and PE, sizing between < 1000 and 2000 Da, were found at concentrations reaching up to 7000 ng/L in some areas. The pentadecanoic acid, 1,2,3-benzotriazoles, 2-ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA), and phthalates such as dimethyl phthalate, mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and the phthalimide were more frequently detected plastic additives. Finally, series of organic contaminants were as well detected in the particulate fraction. These organic contaminants cannot be associated to plastic compositions but can be associated to their adsorption to the particulate matter, in particular to NPL/MPLs, due to their non-polar character. Among these organic contaminants, the more frequently detected were pharmaceutical compounds, food additives and pesticides. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",relevant

Filter-feeding organisms like bivalves have been identified as particularly susceptible to microplastics, and because of this, it has been suggested bivalves could be useful bioindicators of microplastic pollution in ecosystems. We sampled resident mussels and clams from five sites within San Francisco Bay for microplastics and other anthropogenic microparticles. Cages of depurated mussels (denoted transplants) were also deployed at four sites in the Bay for 90 days to investigate temporal uptake of microplastics and microparticles. Because microplastics can sorb PAHs, and thus may act as a source of these chemicals upon ingestion, transplant mussels and resident clams were also analyzed for PAHs. We found anthropogenic microparticles in all samples at all sites, some of which were identified as microplastics. There was no statistical difference between the mean number of microparticles found in resident and transplant species. There were significant site-specific differences among microparticle abundances in the Bay, with the highest abundances observed in the South Bay. No correlation was found between the number of microparticles and the sum concentrations of PAHs, priority PAHs, or any individual PAH, suggesting the chemical concentrations observed reflect broader chemical trends in the Bay rather than direct exposure through microplastic ingestion. The pattern of spatial distribution of microparticles in transplanted mussels matched that of sediment samples from the Bay, suggesting bivalves could be a useful bioindicator of microplastic abundances in sediment, but not surface water. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

This paper examines Hanoi as a case study on single-use plastic by households, investigating the daily generation of single-use plastic waste through a survey, assessing existing policy gaps through a policy review, and providing recommendations on improving management along the supply chain in Vietnam. At almost 27 times a week on average, plastic shopping bags were found to be the most prevalent single-use plastic used by households, followed by wrap/film, straws, coffee cups with plastic lids, cutlery, takeout containers, food packaging, party cups, bottles for water and beverages, and other items. Plastic shopping bags and food packaging are used more often in rural areas than in urban areas. These bags also have a high rate (68.65%) of temporary reuse as kitchen bin liners, a habit that may be difficult to change over the short term. Apart from some components of plastic bottles and packaging that are sold for recycling, most single-use plastic waste is disposed in landfills. Policies are in place to address plastic issues, such as a tax on plastic bags and source separation, but implementation is inconsistent. A behaviour-based combination of top-town and bottom-up approaches along the entire supply chain is recommended to improve existing policy gaps in Vietnam. ?? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

Aquatic sediments are considered as a final sink for MPs, but dredging can remobilize sedimentary MPs into both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Although dredging is globally used for waterway deepening and ecological restoration, the environmental impacts of dredging on MP pollutants has not been previously assessed. In this study, Nile Red staining combined with micro-FTIR methods showed sediments containing high MP concentrations (6060?€?37610 n/kg??DW) from urban/suburban segments of a plain river network in Southeast China. The dredged sediments were stored in piles on farmlands, whereby MPs were subsequently dispersed to surrounding soils and surface waters while awaiting a permanent disposal option. MP concentrations in the soils surrounding the pile were higher in the dry season (wind dispersion), while MP concentrations in waters downstream of the piles were higher in the wet season (rainfall/runoff erosion). Whether dredge sediments are finally used to fertilize farmland, as fill material for coastal land reclamation or dumped into the ocean, MPs have the potential for remobilization into the environment causing concerns with aquatic food webs, agricultural production and human health. Therefore, disposal of dredge sediments containing MPs requires careful assessment to minimize potential environmental impacts. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

This study evaluated the effects of iron red pigment on the photoaging behavior of polypropylene (PP) MPs and the release kinetics of Fe(II) and Fe(III) under simulated sunlight. Based on analyses in surface property and aging products of leachate, the incorporated iron red pigment significantly decreased the photoaging rate of PP MPs. The critical effect mainly depended on the light shielding and the competition of pigment for electrons and reactive oxygen species generated from irradiated MPs. Light irradiation also caused the production of homologous series of organic products containing dicarboxylic acid end groups. Moreover, aging of pigmented MPs enhanced the release of Fe ions in leachates, and the types of released iron ions were different between dark and light conditions, where the iron ion in dark system was mainly as Fe(III), while Fe(II) was the dominant form in light irradiation, since the released Fe(III) reacted with MP-derived organic acids and reactive oxygen species in light condition. The findings highlight the critical role of inorganic pigments in the environmental fate and risk of MPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Impact is one of the most encountered unpredictable loading types which significantly diminishes the mechanical properties of structures. The goal of this study is to investigate the dynamic loading response of bolted basalt-epoxy composite laminates under different impact energies. Unlike the existing low velocity impact tests of bolted composite joints, to reveal the effect of localized impact damage, the low-velocity impact tests were conducted on two different regions as the top of bolt (ToB) and the side of washer (SoW). In addition, the effects of HNTs reinforcement on the impact response and the damage propagation were also evaluated. It was obtained that ToB damage was comparatively severe for the composite joints due to the propagation of the damage through the hole center. Moreover, HNTs improved the impact resistance about %15, especially at lower impact energies. However, the nanoreinforcement efficiency diminished with increasing impact energy levels.

The energy was absorbed by plastic deformation of the aluminium tube and friction between parts. Deformation and driving force?€?displacement responses of the circular tube were analysed by way of numerical simulation, which matched the experimental results. Based on the validated finite element (FE) model, the effects of different geometrical configurations on structural crashworthiness were analysed. The results showed that, throughout the deformation stage, a lag was found in force changes in response to the increasing spacing between the aluminium tube and a rib plate and decreasing inclination angle of the indenter. The plastic energy ratio exceeded 60%. The specific energy absorption (SEA) was separately improved by 59.11%, 265.10%, and 75.00% with the increase of the inclination angle and number of the indenters and the decrease of the distance between the indenter and the centre of the tube. The increase in width of the rib plate could not significantly enhance energy absorption effects in the structure. In addition, by utilising the complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) method, it was found that the aluminium tube T3.5 (with wall thickness T of 3.5 mm) exhibited the optimal structural configuration and the best crashworthiness.

Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) such as phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and bisphenol A (BPA) used as organic plastic additives can pollute the aquatic environment receiving plastic litter. Hence, we have investigated these EDCs in water samples from Ganga and Sundarban wetland of India. Since these compounds exhibit estrogenic potential, we have further measured steroids and evaluated the estrogenic activity (estradiol equivalents, BioE2Eqs) using an in-vitro bioassay (E-Screen). Further BioE2Eqs were compared with the sum of predicted estradiol equivalents based on the chemical concentrations of PAEs and BPA by E-Screen (ChemE2Eq) and YES factors (ChemYES). Caffeine was measured as a marker for anthropogenic wastewater discharge. Results showed that the highest BioE2Eq (below the lowest observable effect of E2 on fish) was associated with sites having sewer outfalls in the middle stretch of the river, and concomitantly coinciding with the elevated concentrations of caffeine. Neither ChemE2Eq nor ChemYES correlated with measured BioE2Eqs.

In this research, equi-atomic AlCoCrFeNi HEA coatings were synthesized via atmospheric plasma spray (APS) using mechanically alloyed feedstock, and a correlation between microstructure and mechanical properties in terms of both hardness and wear were established at multiscale levels. In addition, electrochemical performance in sea water and the overall residual stress distribution in the HEA coatings were also assessed. Superimposition of scanning electron micrographs and statistically analysed heat and contour maps using nanoindentation datasets revealed deviations in localized properties within and across individual phases; which were supported by Weibull plots of individual phases. Scanning wear tests revealed superior nanowear resistance of oxide phases developed by in-flight oxidation during APS process. In comparison, the HEA phases in the coating exhibited significant localized plastic deformation. The outcome of macroscale wear testing postulated that plasma sprayed AlCoCrFeNi HEA coatings exhibited superior wear resistance at high temperature (500 ??C) than at room temperature, signifying high thermal stability of the coating. Residual stress generated due to plasma spray was measured using neutron diffraction and was tensile in nature. The corrosion resistance of the coating was slightly lower than that of SS316L, however, the anodic and cathodic polarization behaviour of HEA coating were identical to that of SS316L, indicating that the AlCoCrFeNi-based HEAs have prospects as corrosion resistant materials. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

This problem arises when the asphalt binders are prepared from hot asphalt mixtures. For this reason, asphalt modifiers are used to minimize failures, avoiding both permanent deformations and the subsequent cracks appearing on the pavements. In this study, seaweed Sargassum (SGZ) was used for the first time as a modifier of asphalt binders, as a response to the urgent need of finding a way to handle and take advantage of the massive amounts of this biomass, which has been found in recent years on the beach coasts of the equatorial Atlantic Ocean forming what the authors call the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt. The rheological properties of these asphalt binders were evaluated by means of a DSR (dynamic shear rheometer) equipment; the results showed that the addition of sargassum at different concentrations (0.5?€?4% wt) increased the permanent deformation factor (G*/sin??), and that higher elastic behavior is reached on the 2.5% SGZ sample. Additionally, the thermal resistance towards high temperatures was identified and compared with the control sample, observing the best results on the SGZ 2.5% sample.

The mean concentration of MPs in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) was 2.04 ?? 2.26 items m???2 and 0.16 ?? 0.17 items m???2 in the open ocean of the EIO. These results illustrate the high spatial heterogeneity of MPs distribution. Micro-FTIR analysis of polymer composition showed that the vast majority of MPs consisted of polypropylene (PP, 51.11%) and polyethylene (PE, 20.07%). Our data show that MP pollution in the EIO, whether in the epeiric sea or the open ocean, is among the highest of the world's oceans. The BoB is likely to become a MP hotspot due to the vast input of land-based plastics and the presence of multiscale recirculation gyres. These results are absolutely thought provoking: The EIO needs more attention on MPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",relevant
9D22F7WB,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143088,Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon sorption and bacterial community composition of biodegradable and conventional plastics incubated in coastal sediments,"Resistant to degradation, plastic litter poses a long-term threat to marine ecosystems. Biodegradable materials have been developed to replace conventional plastics, but little is known of their impacts and degradation in marine environments. A 14-week laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the sorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to conventional (polystyrene PS and polyamide PA) and bio-based, biodegradable plastic films (cellulose acetate CA and poly-L-lactic acid PLLA), and to examine the composition of bacterial communities colonizing these materials. Mesoplastics (1 cm2) of these materials were incubated in sediment and seawater collected from two sites in the Gulf of Finland, on the coast of the highly urbanized area of Helsinki, Finland. PS sorbed more PAHs than did the other plastic types at both sites, and the concentration of PAHs was consistently and considerably smaller in plastics than in the sediment. In general, the plastic bacterial biofilms resembled those in the surrounding media (water and/or sediment). However, in the sediment incubations, the community composition on CA diverged from that of the other three plastic types and was enriched with Bacteroidia and potentially cellulolytic Spirochaetia at both sites. The results indicate that certain biodegradable plastics, such as CA, may harbour potential bioplastic-degrading communities and that PAH sorption capacity varies between polymer types. Since biodegradable plastics are presented as replacements for conventional plastics in applications with risk of ending up in the marine environment, the results highlight the need to carefully examine the environmental behaviour of each biodegradable plastic type before they are extensively introduced to the market. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",irrelevant
VIIXVWI7,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143170,UV degradation of natural and synthetic microfibers causes fragmentation and release of polymer degradation products and chemical additives,"A high proportion of the total microplastic (MP) load in the marine environment has been identified as microfibers (MFs), with polyester (PET) and polyamide (PA) typically found in the highest abundance. The potential for negative environmental impacts from MPs may be dependent on their degree of degradation in the environment, which is influenced by both intrinsic properties (polymer type, density, size, additive chemicals) and extrinsic environmental parameters. Most polymer products break down slowly through a combination of environmental processes, but UV degradation can be a significant source of degradation. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of UV irradiance on the degradation of natural (wool) and synthetic (PET and PA) MFs. Degradation of MFs was conducted in seawater under environmentally relevant accelerated exposure conditions using simulated sunlight. After 56 days of UV exposure, PA primarily exhibited changes in surface morphology with no significant fragmentation observed. PET and wool fibers exhibited both changes in surface morphology and fragmentation into smaller particles. A range of molecular degradation products were identified in seawater leachates after UV exposure, with increasing abundance over the duration of the experiment. Furthermore, a variety of additive chemicals were shown to leach from the MFs into seawater. While some of these chemicals were also susceptible to UV degradation and some are expected to biodegrade rapidly, others may be persistent and contribute to the overall load of chemical pollution in the marine environment. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",irrelevant

GFRP bars were extracted from concrete elements made with two different seawater concrete mix designs and exposed to different environmental conditions for 1, 6, 12, and 24 months. The concrete samples?€? exposure environments consisted of typical field conditions of a subtropical region and seawater at 60 ??C as an accelerated aging method. The mechanical test results of GFRP bars are reported in residual capacities of tensile strength, longitudinal elastic modulus, transverse shear strength, and apparent horizontal shear strength. Furthermore, the physical evaluations are in terms of glass transition temperature (Tg) and microstructural integrity through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. Among all tested properties, tensile strength was the most affected by environmental conditioning. Based on an exponential degradation model, the long-term prediction of the tensile strength capacity was on average 92% under typical field exposure and 72% under the more aggressive conditioning (seawater at 60 ??C). ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

Therefore, further research is still necessary to identify key processes governing MF distribution. Here, the interaction among surface water temperature, salinity, currents and winds explained the patterns of MF accumulation. The estimated density of floating MFs is ???5900 ?? 6800 items m???3 in the global ocean; and three patterns of accumulation were predicted by the proposed model: (i) intermediate densities in ocean gyres, Seas of Japan and of Okhotsk, Mediterranean and around the Antarctic Ocean; (ii) high densities in the Arctic Ocean; and (iii) point zones of highest densities inside the Arctic Seas. Coastal areas and upwelling systems have low accumulation potential. At the same time, zones of divergences between westerlies and trade winds, located above the tropical oceanic gyres, are predicted to accumulate MFs. In addition, it is likely that the warm branch of the thermohaline circulation has an important role in the transport of MFs towards the Arctic Ocean, emphasizing that surface water masses are important predictors. This study highlights that the Arctic Ocean is a dead end for floating MFs. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",relevant
Q5B8MLUG,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123944,Interactions between microplastics and oil dispersion in the marine environment,"Microplastics (MPs) and spilled oil are both major concerns in the marine environment. In this study, we investigated if and how MPs would interact with crude oil and potentially reduce the effectiveness of oil dispersants applied during oil spill response operations. With the addition of dispersant, MPs and oil (covered by dispersants through their hydrophobic tails) formed MPs-oil-dispersant agglomerates that were found to exist from the surface layer to the bottom of the seawater column. Their resurfacing and sinking led to a decrease in oil dispersion effectiveness. Effects of MP concentration, MP aging, and dispersant-to-oil volumetric ratios (DORs) on oil dispersion were examined. We found that the dispersion effectiveness of light oil and heavy oil decreased 38.26 % and 38.25 %, respectively, with an increased MP concentration. The dispersion effectiveness of light oil and heavy oil was 82.86 ?? 10.87 % and 40.39 ?? 4.96 % with pristine MPs and increased up to 109.75 ?? 0.71 % and 58.30 ?? 0.00 % when using MPs aged for 56 days. MPs reduced oil dispersion effectiveness under different DORs. The findings of this first report to understand the interactions among MPs, oil and dispersants have provided fundamental insights that may influence future decision making on the selection and use of oil spill response strategies. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

In the present study, we primarily investigated the uptake and accumulation of a mixture of environmental microplastics (EMPs) obtained during an artificial degradation process in early-juvenile sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Moreover, we evaluated their hazardous effects using biochemical markers of cytotoxicity. Polymer distribution and composition in gill, gut, and liver were analyzed using polarized light microscopy (PLM) and Raman microspectroscopy (RMS). Our findings revealed the size-dependent ingestion and accumulation of smaller MPs (0.45?€?3 ??m) in fish tissues even after a short-term exposure (3 and 5 days). In addition to MPs, our results showed the presence of plastic additives including plasticizers, flame retardants, curing agents, heat stabilizers, and fiber-reinforced plastic materials in fish tissues, which contributed mostly to the larger-sized range (??? 1.2 ??m). Our data showed that significant oxidative alterations were highly correlated with MPs size range.

Sediments and mudskipper samples were collected at high, mid, and low tidal points of five stations. A total of 2657 plastic particles in different size, color, shape, and genera were identified from sediment samples and 15 microplastic were isolated from mudskippers. The highest and lowest abundance of isolated microplastics from sediments was observed in mangrove forests of Bidkhoun (urban area) and Bordkhon, respectively while no microplastics were found in the fish tissue in those stations. The black (60%) and white (7%) color microplastics in the mudskipper had the highest and the lowest frequency. The highest and lowest polymers in mangrove forest sediments were corresponded to polystyrene (26%) and polycarbonate (3%), respectively. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques were used to identify the type of the polymer. Most of the microplastics found were made of polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate. The type of studied area and texture of sediment separately affected the frequency of microplastic and mesoplastic (P-value <0.05) in the sediment samples. The abundance of microplastics in the sediment samples of the Bidkhoun mangrove forest was higher than other studied stations due to proximity to urban and industrial areas.

The target microplastics for risk assessment were specified as only non-spherical type microplastics in the size range 20?€?300 ??m, because this type was predominantly observed in our study areas, and adverse biological effects have previously been reported. Exposure data for non-spherical microplastics were obtained from a previous study or were measured for microplastics of sizes down to 20 ??m. A predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of 12 particles/L was derived by employing a species sensitivity distribution approach. Then the results were compared to the in situ observed concentrations at each site. The detected microplastic concentrations did not exceed the derived PNEC, i.e., the current pollution levels of fragment and fiber microplastics in the size range 20?€?300 ??m would not pose a significant threat to the marine ecosystem in South Korea. However, predictions are that microplastic pollution will increase to 50-fold by 2100 at the current rates, and in this scenario, the microplastic concentration is expected to far exceed the derived PNEC values for marine ecosystems. It is therefore urgent to take precautionary actions to prevent a further increase in microplastic concentrations in these environments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",relevant
CK6QZP92,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142099,Microplastic accumulation via trophic transfer: Can a predatory crab counter the adverse effects of microplastics by body defence?,"Microplastics are considered detrimental to aquatic organisms due to their potential accumulation along food chains. Thus, it is puzzling why some of them appear unaffected by microplastics. Here, we assessed the contribution of water filtration and food consumption to microplastic accumulation in a predatory marine crab (Charybdis japonica) and examined the associated impacts of microplastics (particle size: 5 ??m) following ingestion for one week. Results showed that water filtration and food consumption contributed similarly to the accumulation of microplastics, which were distributed among organs in this order: hepatopancreas &gt; guts &gt; gills &gt; muscles. Yet, biomagnification (i.e. accumulation through consumption of microplastic-contaminated mussels) did not occur possibly due to egestion of microplastics. The crabs upregulated detoxification capacity (EROD) and antioxidant defence (GST) in response to the microplastics accumulated in their tissues. However, these defence mechanisms collapsed when the microplastic concentration in hepatopancreas exceeded 3 mg g???1, leading to severe hepatic injury (elevated AST and ALT) and impaired neural activity (reduced AChE). Our results suggest that marine organisms have an innate capacity to counter the acute effects of microplastics, but there is a limit beyond which the defence mechanisms fail and hence physiological functions are impaired. As microplastic pollution will deteriorate in the future, the fitness and survival of marine organisms may be undermined by microplastics, affecting the stability and functioning of marine ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Despite the lack of significant relationship in the abundance of microplastics, their dominant features such as size, shape, color and polymer type were similar between bivalves and seawater. Fragments (69% for oyster/mussel, 72% for Manila clam, and 77% for seawater), particles smaller than 300 ??m (96% for oyster/mussel, 83% for Manila clam, and 84% for seawater) and colorless (79% for oyster/mussel, 85% for Manila clam, 75% for seawater) were the dominant shape, size and color, respectively. The major polymer types were polypropylene, polyethylene, and polyester. The microplastic level in bivalves was relatively high in urbanized areas with a wide diversity of polymer types compared with those in non-urbanized areas, and the proportion of polystyrene in the Korean samples was abundant compared with other regions due to wide use of polystyrene products in Korea.

Recently it was shown that polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be degraded in a saltwater-based environment using bacterial PETase produced by a marine diatom. At moderate temperatures, plastic biodegradation is slow and requires sensitive methods for detection, at least at initial stages. However, conventional methods for verifying the plastic degradation are either complex, expensive, time-consuming or they interfere with the degradation process. Here, we adapt lensless digital holographic microscopy (LDHM) as a new application for efficiently monitoring enzymatic degradation of a PET glycol copolymer (PETG).

At the time of sampling (24 h post feeding), some larvae had evacuated all MP spheres from the gut, while others still had MP remaining in the gut. In larvae with a significant number of MP spheres still present in the gut, whole-body scintillation counting (including the MP in the gut lumen) showed elevated levels of the tracer compared to those in the control fish larvae. For larvae in which all or almost all MP had been evacuated by the time of sampling, the tracer levels of the whole body were not significantly different compared to those for the control fish larvae. These data indicate that there was no significant transfer of PCB-153 from contaminated MP into fish larvae within a gut-transit time of &lt;24 h. This study suggests that the vector role of MP in HOC uptake and absorption may be minor compared to that of other HOC uptake pathways. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",irrelevant

Given their growing interest in the context of marine pollution and biomonitoring, this study focused on the in vitro sensitivity of marine invertebrate CEs to some pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products and plastic additives to assess their potential interaction on this enzymatic system and its suitability as biomarkers. Three bivalves, one gastropod and two crustaceans were used and CEs were quantified following current protocols set for mammalian models. Four substrates were screened for CEs determination and to test their adequacy in the hepatic fraction measures of the selected invertebrates. Two commercial recombinant human isoforms (hCE1 and hCE2) were also included for methodological validation. Among the invertebrates, mussels were revealed as the most sensitive to xenobiotic exposures while gastropods were the least as well as with particular substrate-specific preferences. Among chemicals of environmental concern, the plastic additive tetrabromobisphenol A displayed the highest CE-inhibitory capacity in all species. Since plastic additives easily breakdown from the polymer and may accumulate and metabolise in marine biota, their interaction with the CE key metabolic/detoxification processes may have consequences in invertebrate's physiology, affect bioaccumulation and therefore trophic web transfer and, ultimately, human health as shellfish consumers. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

The adverse effects of DEHP have garnered increasing concern as they are recognized as endocrine disruptors. However, information on the effects of DEHP in marine organisms remains limited. In this study, acute toxic effects on marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) following DEHP exposure were investigated. Transcriptome analysis was performed on the livers of medaka exposed to DEHP for 6 and 24 h. Results showed that 1595 genes were affected in all the analyzed specimens, and several genes expressed variably according to sex. Some pathways associated with immunity, metabolism, and endocrine system were significantly enriched, with the complement system appearing to be the most affected immune pathway. Pathway enrichment indicated that, under acute DEHP exposure, the immune response of females tended to be more sensitive than that of males. In addition, ferroptosis occurred in response to DEHP exposure, which resulted in an enrichment of the ferroptosis pathway along with iron overload, an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) content, and a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels. These results indicate that a form of cell death characterized by iron-dependence occurred following DEHP exposure, but the underlying mechanism requires further analysis. This study implies that DEHP can alter some molecular regulation patterns within a short period and induce cell death through ferroptosis. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

The present work aimed at investigating the physiological and behavioral effects of thirty-six juvenile Sparus aurata exposed to control, virgin and weathered MPs enriched diets during a 21-day period under controlled conditions. Physiological effects were assessed in liver and brain using the following biomarkers: activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GRd), the detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) and malondialdehyde (MDA) as indicative of lipid peroxidation. Individuals were recorded for behavior analysis (i.e. social interactions and feeding behavior). Results revealed an increase in cellular stress from control to weathered fish groups, with the virgin group showing intermediate levels in all quantified biomarkers. Significant differences were found in the liver for all biomarkers except for MDA, suggesting that exposure time to MPs in this experiment is long enough to trigger the activation of antioxidant enzymes but not to produce cell damage by lipid peroxidation. In brain tissue samples, fish from the weathered group presented significantly higher values for CAT and SOD, highlighting its function as primary antioxidants. Regarding behavioral effects, results showed that the two MPs enriched groups were significantly bolder during social interactions and, although no significantly, tended to be more active during feeding. In conclusion, MPs which have been weathered in marine environmental conditions produces a higher physiological response than virgin MPs but also, a physiological response is variable depending on the tissue analyzed. In addition, a short period to MP exposure seems to affect overall social and feeding behavior but, further research is needed to assess long-term effects of MP ingestion and its potential consequences on fish populations. ?? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

In this study, a series of triaxial tests was conducted on natural Wenzhou soft clays to investigate the reconsolidation responses induced by staged cyclic loading under intermittent drainage conditions. The dynamic behaviours of the test specimens, such as the evolution of excess pore water pressure, variations in stress-strain hysteresis loops and resilient modulus, and cumulative strain development, are analysed and discussed. The experimental results show that during the intermittent quiescent drainage period, the dissipation of the excess pore pressure generated during the cyclic loading period results in reconsolidation of the test specimen. Hardening occurs throughout the tests, as determined by observing the variations in the hysteresis loops and resilient modulus. Throughout the tests, a higher percentage of the axial plastic strain in the quiescent period to the total axial plastic strain indicates that the reconsolidation deformation of the soft clay subgrade caused by intermittent drainage cannot be ignored. These conclusions have significant value for performing in-depth research on the dynamic behaviours of marine sedimentary clays subjected to cyclic traffic loading and predicting the settlement of roads in engineering practice. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

Despite the societal benefits, plastic has become a growing global concern due to it is persistence and bioavailability as microplastics (MPs) to aquatic biota. In order to provide mechanistic insights into the early toxicity effects of MPs on aquatic invertebrates, a short-term (up to 72 h) exposure to 3 ??m red polystyrene MPs (50 particles/mL) was conducted on marine mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, selected as model organism for their ability to ingest MPs and their commercial relevance. The use of protonic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR)-based metabolomics, combined with chemometrics, enabled a comprehensive exploration at fixed exposure time-points (T24, T48, T72) of the impact of MPs accumulated in mussel digestive glands, chosen as the major site for pollutants storage and detoxification processes. In detail, 1H NMR metabolic fingerprints of MP-treated mussels were clearly separated from control and grouped for experimental time-points by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Numerous metabolites, including amino acids, osmolytes, metabolites involved in energy metabolism, and antioxidants, participating in various metabolic pathways significantly changed over time in MP-exposed mussel digestive glands related to control, reflecting also the fluctuations in MPs accumulation and pointing out the occurrence of disorders in amino acid metabolism, osmotic equilibrium, antioxidant defense system and energy metabolism.

Based on experiences from the Baltic Sea and existing practices from countries with different management systems clear distinction between the management of natural and anthropogenic components of cast material is seen as an essential prerequisite for developing sustainable product chains that allow beach wrack to be used as a resource of commercial value. Presenting and discussing examples from Denmark (K??ge Municipality), Germany (K??hlungsborn, R??gen and Poel Island), Poland (Gulf of Gdansk), Russia (Curonian and Vistula spits) and Sweden (Kalmar municipality and ??land), social, ecological, and economic consequences of beach wrack removal are analysed to improve the attractiveness of beaches for recreational purposes. It also includes potential contribution to Baltic Sea water restoration processes through the removal of the organic part of beach cast, where indeed more studies about the chemical (nutrients, metals) composition of beach wrack are required for reliable calculation of a depuration rate. For local economies within the Baltic Sea region, the organic part of beach cast (beach wrack and terrestrial debris) has reasonable economic prospects as a renewable natural resource, e.g. for soil improvement products, in fertilisers and bio-coal production, for landfill covers (contributing to climate change mitigation), biogas generation, and even for coastal protection by providing humus-like material for accelerated dune vegetation succession. For all these recycling options the development of cost-efficient technologies for collecting beach cast on sandy as well as stony beaches and also for separating the organic part from sand and anthropogenic litter (mainly plastic), is urgently required. Amendments of legal regulations, that better reflect the dualism of beach cast are also required. In essence, dualism results from the fact that beach wrack is a part of nature (or a natural resource) when it remains on a beach. However, beach wrack immediately becomes legally categorised as waste once humans collect it irrespective of its litter content. Another legal aspect being dealt with originates from the migration of the beach wrack between water and beach, whilst it is an object of ???€leagl cleaning operations only at the beach it onto the beach, but not whilst in the water. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

This may be more harmful to human beings than marine MPs as the agricultural soil films are closer to our living environment. But few works focused on the adsorption of pesticides on pristine or aged agricultural polyethylene soil films MPs. In order to promote the risk assessment of co-exposure of pesticides and agricultural polyethylene soil films MPs, a comparative study on the adsorption behavior and mechanism of four pesticides (carbendazim, diflubenzuron, malathion, difenoconazole) by pristine PE MPs and APE MPs were carried out in this paper. The results showed microcracks and surface oxidation observed on APE MPs. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm models indicated that the adsorption capacity of APE MPs was higher than that of PE MPs, which attribute to the larger surface area of APE MPs. The adsorption capacities of pesticides on APE MPs were positively correlated with LogKow (Water octanol partition coefficient) values of these four pesticides, showed the hydrophobic partitioning played the most important part in the adsorption, but also some H-bonding between secondary amines in the molecular of diflubenzuron and polar O-containing functional groups on APE MPs may be formed. And electrostatic forces or interactions are not the determining factor for these pesticides adsorption behavior of PE MPs, and the effect of pH is mainly driven by changes in sorbate properties rather than changes in surface properties of MPs. The results presented herein show the APE MPs can be a better vector of most hydrophobic pesticides than pristine MPs in the agricultural field, and more attention should be paid to the problem of films and pesticides residue in farmland soil. ?? 2020 The Authors",irrelevant

Although equipped with anti-corrosion and high strength, the reduced ductility due to the linear elastic nature of conventional fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars hinders their application scope in civil engineering. Inherited the advantages of FRP bars, steel fiber-reinforced polymer composite bars (SFCBs) are also characterized by good ductility and stable post-yield stiffness, which can potentially be ideal reinforcement for concrete structures made with un-desalted corrosive raw materials. This paper presents experimental and theoretical investigations on the flexural performance of SFCB reinforced SSRC beams. Test results indicate that the displacement ductility factor of almost all the SFCB reinforced SSRC beams are in a range from 3.7 to 4.9. The ratios of peak load-to-yielding load of SFCB reinforced SSRC beams varied from 1.5 to 3.1, indicating a remarkable post-yield behavior. Compared with the counterparts with natural aggregates, SSRC beams show slightly reduced flexural strength and comparable ductility. Theoretical models were proposed to predict the load-deflection responses of SFCB reinforced SSRC beams, which paves the way for the design of such members. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

In this paper, the influences of the sulfate on the adhesion of the CFRP/concrete interface are investigated by combination of experiments and molecular dynamics simulation. Macro experiments show that the debonding between CFRP and concretes generally results from the adhesive failure at the epoxy/concrete interface. As the corrosion age increases, the maximum shear stress of the interface decreases gradually and tends to transfer to the non-loading side. Meanwhile, both of the fracture energy and adhesive strength of the CFRP/concrete interface is reduced due to the sulfate attack. Besides, molecular dynamics simulations reveal the micro-adhesive mechanism of the epoxy/calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) interface, and offer an atomic explanation for the sulfate environment weakening the adhesion of epoxy/C-S-H interface.

Likewise, the developmental toxicity of chemicals leached from plastic particles is understudied. The consequences of these developmental effects are likely underestimated, and the effects on ecosystems are unknown. Using the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus as a model, we studied the effects of leachates of three forms of plastic pellet: new industrial pre-production plastic nurdles, beached pre-production nurdles, and floating filters, known as biobeads, also retrieved from the environment. Our chemical analyses show that leachates from beached pellets (biobead and nurdle pellets) and highly plasticised industrial pellets (PVC) contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls, which are known to be detrimental to development and other life stages of animals. We also demonstrate that these microplastic leachates elicit severe, consistent and treatment-specific developmental abnormalities in P. lividus at embryonic and larval stages. Those embryos exposed to virgin polyethylene leachates with no additives nor environmental contaminants developed normally, suggesting that the abnormalities observed are the result of exposure to either environmentally adsorbed contaminants or pre-existing industrial additives within the polymer matrix.

Most research into the distribution of microplastics has focused on water but here we show that wind transport can be very effective in mobilising microplastic particles. A series of wind tunnel experiments using two different substrates (sand and soil), two different microplastics (microbeads and fibres) and 5 different concentrations of microplastics (ranging from 0 mg kg???1dw to 1040 mg kg???1dw) is used to demonstrate that microplastics are preferentially transported by wind compared to sand and soil. When compared to either of the untreated substrate beds (0 mg kg???1dw), the inclusion of microplastics was not found to significantly affect the wind erosion threshold for any of the concentrations or geometric forms (fibres or beads) tested. Averaged over all concentrations of microplastics and both substrate types, microplastic enrichment was lower for microbeads than fibres. The enrichment of microplastic fibres within the entrained particulate matter was one to two orders of magnitude higher for both test bed substrates, ranging from 98 to 498 for the sand and 278 to 726 for the soil.

Here we investigated for the first time the occurrence of microplastic retention by marine canopies in a hydraulic flume under unidirectional flow velocities from 2 to 30 cm s???1. We used as model canopy-forming species the seagrass Zostera marina with four canopy shoot density (0, 50, 100, 200 shoots m???2), and we used as microplastic particles industrial pristine pellets with specific densities from 0.90 to 1.34 g cm???3 (polypropylene PP; polystyrene PS; polyamide 6 PA; and polyethylene terephthalate PET). Overall, microplastics particles transported with the flow were retained in the seagrass canopies but not in bare sand. While seagrass canopies retained floating microplastics (PP) only at low velocities (&lt;12 cm s???1) due to a barrier created by the canopy touching the water surface, the retention of sinking particles (PS, PA, PET) occurred across a wider range of flow velocities. Our simulations revealed that less dense sinking particles (PS) might escape from the canopy at high velocities, while denser sinking particles can be trapped in scouring areas created by erosive processes around the eelgrass shoots. Our results show that marine canopies might act as potential barriers or sinks for microplastics at certain bio-physical conditions, with the probability of retention generally increasing with the seagrass shoot density and polymer specific density and decreasing with the flow velocity. We conclude that seagrass meadows, and other aquatic canopy-forming ecosystems, should be prioritized habitats in assessment of microplastic exposure and impact on coastal areas since they may accumulate high concentration of microplastic particles that could affect associated fauna. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",irrelevant

Furthermore, whether MP exposure influences coral susceptibility to other stressors such as ocean warming is unknown. Our objective was to determine the physiology response of corals exposed to MP concentrations that have been observed in-situ at ambient and elevated temperature that replicates ocean warming. Here, two sets of short-term experiments were conducted at ambient and elevated temperature, exposing the corals Acropora sp. and Seriatopora hystrix to microspheres and microfibres. Throughout the experiments, gross photosynthesis and net respiration was quantified using a 4-chamber coral respirometer, and photosynthetic yields of photosystem II were measured using Pulse-Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry. Results indicate the effect of MP exposure is dependent on MP type, coral species, and temperature. MP fibres (but not spheres) reduced photosynthetic capability of Acropora sp., with a 41% decrease in photochemical efficiency at ambient temperature over 12 days. No additional stress response was observed at elevated temperature; photosynthetic performance significantly increased in Seriatopora hystrix exposed to MP spheres. These findings show that a disruption to coral photosynthetic ability can occur at MP concentrations that have been observed in the marine environment and that MP pollution impact on corals remains an important aspect for further research. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

Once released, plastics may undergone degradation through several agents, such as solar radiation, mechanical forces, and microbial action. Weathered plastics and microplastics (MPs) collected from the marine environment show considerable physical and chemical differences regarding their pristine counterparts; most notably on their surface, where spectrometric measurements are done. Hence, it is crucial to consider aging for their correct identification and quantification in environmental monitoring. Five of the most common polymers employed worldwide for packaging (LDPE, HDPE, PS, PP and PET) were weathered in a pilot-scale system simulating dry and marine conditions for more than 10 weeks. Aliquots were withdrawn periodically to monitor their weathering processes by means of infrared spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy; their spectra were compared and band ratios calculated. Results showed that an individual study of each polymer is necessary since degradation pathways and products depend on the polymer type. Moreover, including spectra of weathered polymers in the spectral libraries to obtain reliable identifications in microplastics pollution studies was critical. ?? 2020",irrelevant

The MPs are environmentally concerning due to their bioavailability and potential impacts on a wide range of marine biota, so assessing their impact on the biota has become an urgent research priority. In the present study, we exposed Crassostrea gigas oysters to irregular MPs of two polymer types (polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) at concentrations of 10 and 1000 ??g L???1 for 21 days. Accumulation of MPs, changes in metabolic enzyme activity, and histological damage were evaluated, and metabolomics analysis was conducted. Results demonstrated that PE and PET MPs were detected in the gills and digestive gland following exposure to both tested concentrations, confirming ingestion of MPs by the organisms. Moreover, both PE and PET MPs inhibited lipid metabolism, while energy metabolism enzyme activities were activated in the oysters. Histopathological damage of exposed oysters was also observed in this study. Integrated biomarker response (IBR) results showed that MPs toxicity increased with increasing MPs concentration, and the toxic effects of PET MPs on oysters was greater than PE MPs. In addition, metabolomics analysis suggested that MPs exposure induced alterations in metabolic profiles in oysters, with changes in energy metabolism and inflammatory responses. This study reports new insights into the consequences of MPs exposure in marine bivalves at environmentally relevant concentrations, providing valuable information for ecological risk assessment of MPs in a realistic conditions. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

The sea forest, mangrove, has been polluted by a large number of plastic debris worldwide. To fill the gaps in knowledge of mangrove rhizosphere microbes connected with the ?€?plasticsphere?€?, a semi-controlled in situ exposure experiment for nine different types of microplastics were conducted in mangrove ecosystem. A sign of biodegrading was observed on polyethylene, polyamide 6 and polyvinyl chloride microplastics surface after 3 months exposure. We discovered that the metabolic activities of the dominant bacteria on certain microplastics were related to the specific groups on polymers molecule. The selective colonization may be driven by the chemotaxis of bacteria. Specially, microplastics biofilms of polyethylene, polyamide 6, polyvinyl chloride and expanded polystyrene possess distinctive dominant bacteria assemblages which have great significance in ecosystem processes involving carbon cycle or sulfur cycle. Community of mangrove soil microorganism and microplastic biofilm varies as the seasons changes. As a new niche, microplastics has higher inclusivity to bacteria than surrounding soil. Additionally, pathogens for human beings (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Escherichia-Shigella) were detected both in microplastics and soil. We stress that the interaction between microplastics and rhizosphere microorganisms may affect the growth and health of mangrove plants. Besides, we point out that mangrove rhizosphere microorganism can be an ideal candidate for plastics-degradation. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

This ubiquitous presence of MP particles opens the possibility for their ingestion by nearly all species in the marine ecosystem. Reports have shown that MP particles are present in local commercial seafood species leading to the possible human ingestion of these particles. However, due to a lack of harmonized methods to identify microplastics (MPs), results from different studies and locations can hardly be compared. Hence, this study was aimed to detect, quantify, and estimate MP contamination in commercially important mussels originating from 12 different countries distributed worldwide. All mussels were obtained from supermarkets and were intended for human consumption. Using a combinatorial approach of focal plane array (FPA)-based micro- Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy allowed the detection and characterization of MP down to a size of 3 ??m in the investigated mussels. Further, a gentle sample purification method based on enzymes has been modified in order to optimize the digestion of organic material in mussels. A random forest classification (RFC) approach, which allows a rapid discrimination between different polymer types and thus fast generation of data on MP abundance and size distributions with high accuracy, was implemented in the analytical pipeline for IR spectra. Additionally, for the first time we also applied a RFC approach for the automated characterization of Raman spectra of MPs.

It is essential to develop models to predict the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions onto microplastics in global aquatic environments, and to connect the laboratory study results with the field measurement results. In this paper, the artificial neural networks (ANN) models were established based on literature data. for The results showed that the ANN model could predict the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions (including Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, and Zn) onto microplastics in the global environments with high correlation coefficient (R) values (0.926???0.994). The predicted sorption capacity was influenced by the initial concentration of heavy metal ions and the salinity in surrounding water. The predicted sorption capacity in rivers and lakes was higher than that in the ocean. Aged microplastics had higher affinity to heavy metal ions than virgin microplastics. The predicted sorption capacity of Cd, Pb, and Zn ions onto large microplastics (5 mm) was less than 0.12 ??g/g. The predicted amount was in agreement with the field measurement results, suggesting that the laboratory studies can provide useful information for projecting the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions onto microplastics in global aquatic environments. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

However, little is known about its potential impacts on pollinators. Here, we reported the effects of 25 ??m-diameter spherical polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) alone or in combination with the antibiotic tetracycline on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in the laboratory. We noticed that PS-MPs exposure for 14 d had sublethal effects, with low mortalities (up to 1.6 %) across three different treatments (0.5, 5, and 50 mg/L) and no changes to the body weight gains compared to the control bees. Nevertheless, PS-MPs exposure led to significant decreases in the ??-diversity of bees?€? gut microbiota accompanied by changes to the core microbial population structure. Additionally, PS-MPs lead to alterations in the expression of antioxidative (Cat), detoxification (CypQ1 and GstS3), and immune system-related genes (Domeless, Hopscotch, and Symplekin) in guts. More interestingly, we observed that PS-MPs accumulated and degraded inside of the hindgut and interacted with gut bacteria. The depletion of the normal gut microbiota using tetracycline dramatically increased the lethality of microplastics. These results provide a resource for future research on microplastic-microbiome interactions in other insects and also shed light on understanding the potential effects of microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

In 10 ??g/L TBT-exposed rotifer, the 1 and 0.5 x diet groups resulted in reproduction reduction. However, 10 x diet treatment showed no significant changes in the total fecundity, despite a decrease in daily reproduction. Besides, differences in the lifespan were observed in response to different diet regimens. TBT and/or MP-exposed parental rotifer (F0) showed a significant delay in the pre-reproductive day under 0.5 x diet regimen. In all dietary regimens, exposure to TBT and MP induced an increase in reactive oxygen species, but antioxidant activities were perturbed. To further verify the carryover effect of TBT toxicity, progeny rotifer (F1) obtained from 24 h TBT and/or MP-exposed F0 was used. Interestingly, the faster hatching rate was observed only in F1 obtained from 1 x diet regimen-exposed F0. However, in the 0.5 x diet, the total fecundity was reduced and the pattern of the daily reproduction was collapsed. Thus, the toxicity of TBT can be alleviated by MP and nutrition status, but TBT-induced toxicity and its carryover effect are inevitable. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

We presented results of the first baseline research of microplastics in groundwater and surface water from the coastal south India (Tamil Nadu state) and evaluated the heavy metal adsorption capacities of different polymers. The microplastics (up to 19.9 particles/L) were of relatively larger size in surface water (0.34?€?4.30 mm) compared to the groundwater (0.12?€?2.50 mm). Polyamide (nylon), polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and cellulose were the common polymers and all of them showed different capacities of heavy metal adsorption.

Emissions are calculated by applying two different data sets of emission factors and the annual mileage for distinct vehicles and road types (urban roads, rural roads, highways). Environmental entry paths of tyre and road wear particles (TRWP) were considered including releases to ambient air, soils and surface waters. Road runoff treatment was taken into account differentiated into sewage systems in urban areas and at non-urban roads. This study identifies the soundest data available concerning emission factors, data on traffic and road systems as well as comprehensive information on road runoff treatment in Germany.

Typically, environmental noise control and mitigation or SONAR are disciplines commonly demanding the knowledge of insertion losses of the material used for such purposes. Materials selected for these applications usually have good structural properties but also are lightweight and have good corrosion behavior and specific acoustic performances (e.g. baffling, transparency). In this sense, glass-reinforced plastics, as well as carbon fiber materials, synthetic or natural rubbers, urethane compounds, etc. are, more and more, part of tailored underwater structures, pods, covers, or acoustic windows.

This is having a substantial impact on the local marine ecosystems as biodiverse natural hard substrata are being replaced with man-made structures, which have been shown to support lower levels of biodiversity. The ecological value of artificial coastal structures could be enhanced through careful design of pre-fabricated ecologically engineered units. Material selection is a critical parameter in the design of these units. To maximise the potential of concrete units to support and increase biodiversity, this paper explores the impact of binder composition, aggregate type and plasticizer on surface chemistry and early biofilm formation which influence subsequent colonisation. Experiments in the current study have shown that the addition of ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) to the mix can increase the levels of biodiversity supported while maintaining engineering performance requirements in terms of strength, chloride resistance and alkalinity. Conversely the aggregate type and use of a plasticizer have a minor influence. In particular, the addition of GGBS was shown to increase the biomass of diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae and barnacle abundance one month after immersion on both sheltered surfaces and those exposed to wave action. Results suggest that concrete composition can alter the surface chemistry of artificial structures and thereby can improve the ecological value of these structures as habitats for marine life. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

There, we observe numerous high-amplitude dipping reflections in the lower oceanic crust which was accreted at a magmatic spreading center as testified by the almost uniform 6.4-7 km thick crust and its unfaulted, flat top basement. The deep reflections are rooting onto the Moho and are dipping both ridgeward and continentward. They occur in dense networks in mature oceanic crust as well as close to the continentward termination of oceanic crust and in the ocean-continent transition zone. The comparison with field observations in the Oman ophiolite suggests that these lower crustal dipping reflectors could correspond to syn-magmatic faults. In Oman, very high temperature (up to syn-magmatic), high temperature (sub-solidus plastic deformation) and low temperature (brittle) deformation coexist along the same fault over distances of a few hundred meters at Moho level. This very high temperature gradient may be explained by the sudden and intense interaction between crystallizing magmas and hydrothermal fluids induced by the episodic nucleation of faults in a context of continuous magmatic spreading. The igneous layering becomes extremely irregular compared to its monotonous sub-horizontal orientation away from the faults which, together with enhanced hydrothermal alteration restricted to the fault zones, might change the physical properties (velocity, density) and increase the reflectivity of syn-magmatic faults. We further speculate that these processes could explain the brightness of the lower crustal dipping reflectors observed in our seismic reflection data. Both the seismic reflection profiles of the Enderby Basin and the Oman ophiolite show evidence for syn-accretion tectonism at depth together with the systematic rotation of originally horizontal lava flows or originally vertical dikes, pre-dating cessation of magmatic activity. This indicates ubiquitous deformation processes within the axial zone of magmatic spreading centers. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Structural repair using composite material has significant advantages in these cases than the conventional repair by welding or bolting steel sleeves. However, the composite repair technology with fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) is not very well established for their usage on load bearing offshore steel structural members either in underwater or above water conditions. The study had attempted to do a pilot experimental study on steel tubular members under the combination of axial compression and bending loads to address this gap in knowledge. The specimens were grouped into four categories: intact, corroded, repaired in air and repaired underwater. The repair scheme remained the same for in air and underwater repairs with one layer of glass and two layers of carbon fibre reinforced polymers, but with resin and repair methodology being different for both. The repaired specimens showed notable improvement in the ultimate strength from the corroded members to match the intact strength. Underwater repairs proved to be adequate to replicate the ultimate strength achieved by the conventional in air repairs. Investigations into parameters like load displacement behaviour, energy absorption, ductility and strain values also revealed that the underwater repair performed very similar to the conventional in air repair. A simplified Finite Element model simulating the repaired specimens was also presented in the paper which had predicted the experimental behaviour with great accuracy. In conclusion, the underwater and above water repair of structural steel tubular members using FRP composite materials seem a very viable solution for the corroded load bearing members in the offshore industry, however more detailed study on long term performance and cyclic behaviour of the composite repaired members is yet to be carried out. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

In order to assess the ecotoxicity of environmental microplastics (MPs), samples were collected from the beaches of two islands in the Guadeloupe archipelago, Petit-Bourg (PB) located on the main island of Guadeloupe and Marie-Galante (MG) on the second island of the archipelago. These samples have a similar polymer composition with mainly polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). However, these two samples are very dissimilar with regard to their contamination profile and their toxicity. MPs from MG contain more lead, cadmium and organochlorine compounds while those from PB have higher levels of copper, zinc and hydrocarbons. The leachates of these two samples of MPs induced sublethal effects on the growth of sea urchins and on the pulsation frequency of jellyfish ephyrae but not on the development of zebrafish embryos. The toxic effects are much more marked for samples from the PB site than those from the MG site.

Psammechinus miliaris are strong omnivores with dietary intake including hard components (e.g. shell, tubeworms) and therefore likely to cope with the ingestion of MPs, while P. lividus are strong herbivores consuming softer dietary items (e.g. biofilms, algae) and therefore more likely sensitive. Responses to environmentally relevant MPs were conducted across two trials. Trial one determined the impact of short term (24 h) external exposure to storm-like sediment resuspension of MP concentrations (53 ??m polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 25,000 MP L???1) compared to a control without MPs. No significant impacts were observed for both P. lividus and P. miliaris on metabolic rate or righting time, and urchins were able to remove MPs from the body surface using pedicellariae and cilia. Trial two determined the impact of medium term (2 months) ingestion of a diet laced with PVC MPs (59 ??m) at an inclusion rate of 0.5% mass and a control diet (without MPs) on somatic growth and animal condition. The ingestion of MPs did not significantly impact P. miliaris but significantly reduced the alimentary index within P. lividus, indicating a compromised nutritional state. This study shows that responses to microplastics are species-specific and therefore cannot be generalized. Furthermore, feeding habit could act as a potential indicator for sensitivity to MP ingestion which will be important for impact assessments of plastic pollution and management strategies. ?? 2020",irrelevant

The abundance of marine debris, composition and its distribution over the seafloor along north-east coast of Arabian coast was studied through trawl based swept method. Experimental fishing was conducted fortnightly using shrimp bottom trawl and collected debris was categorized as per standard protocols. A total of 1077 pieces of debris (11.7 kg dry weight) were collected from 25 hauls. The average number and weight of debris were 943 items/km2 and 10.2 kg/km2 respectively. The estimated total marine debris along this coast was 379 t (dry weight). Plastic-based debris contributed maximum (87.1%) to the total debris collected in numbers and among this, plastic bags and food wrappers were dominant. Debris produced by shoreline/recreational activities comprised the major source of debris (88.6%) along this coast. This study provides the evidence that the effective use of available fishing trawlers and co-management practices (?€?Make fishers friend?€?) can help to remove the seabed debris. The base data generated through this study would facilitate region-based effective control and management of plastic debris pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",relevant

Additionally, sea ice reduction in the Arctic is opening new opportunities for the oil and maritime industries, which could increase oil pollution in the region. Yet knowledge of the effects of co-exposure to MPs and crude oil on Arctic zooplankton is lacking. We tested the influence of MPs (polyethylene, 20.7 ??m) on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bioaccumulation and oil toxicity in the key arctic copepod Calanus hyperboreus after exposure to oil with and without dispersant. Up to 30% of the copepods stopped feeding and fecal pellet production rates were reduced after co-exposure to oil (1 ??L L???1) and MPs (20 MPs mL???1). The PAH body burden was 3 times higher in feeding than in non-feeding copepods. Copepods ingested both MPs and crude oil droplets. MPs did not influence bioaccumulation of PAHs in copepods or their fecal pellets, but chemical dispersant increased bioaccumulation, especially of ???4 ring-PAHs. Our results suggest that MPs do not act as vectors of PAHs in Arctic marine food webs after oil spills, but, at high concentrations (20 MPs mL???1), MPs can trigger behavioral stress responses (e.g., feeding suppression) to oil pollution in zooplankton. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant
L6G5DWME,10.5194/tc-15-113-2021,Drivers of Pine Island Glacier speed-up between 1996 and 2016,"Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica is among the fastest changing glaciers worldwide. Over the last 2 decades, the glacier has lost in excess of a trillion tons of ice, or the equivalent of 3mm of sea level rise. The ongoing changes are thought to have been triggered by ocean-induced thinning of its floating ice shelf, grounding line retreat, and the associated reduction in buttressing forces. However, other drivers of change, such as large-scale calving and changes in ice rheology and basal slipperiness, could play a vital, yet unquantified, role in controlling the ongoing and future evolution of the glacier. In addition, recent studies have shown that mechanical properties of the bed are key to explaining the observed speed-up. Here we used a combination of the latest remote sensing datasets between 1996 and 2016, data assimilation tools, and numerical perturbation experiments to quantify the relative importance of all processes in driving the recent changes in Pine Island Glacier dynamics. We show that (1) calving and ice shelf thinning have caused a comparable reduction in ice shelf buttressing over the past 2 decades; that (2) simulated changes in ice flow over a viscously deforming bed are only compatible with observations if large and widespread changes in ice viscosity and/or basal slipperiness are taken into account; and that (3) a spatially varying, predominantly plastic bed rheology can closely reproduce observed changes in flow without marked variations in ice-internal and basal properties. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to its evolving ice thickness, calving processes and a heterogeneous bed rheology play a key role in the contemporary evolution of Pine Island Glacier. ?? 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Mechanical abrasion, photochemical oxidation and biological degradation of larger plastic debris result in the formation of microplastics (MPs, 1 ??m to 5 mm) and nanoplastics (NPs, 1 nm to 1000 nm). Compared with MPs, the environmental fate, ecosystem toxicity and potential risks associated with NPs have so far been less explored. This review provides a state-of-the-art overview of current research on NPs with focus on currently less-investigated fields, such as the environmental fate in agroecosystems, migration in porous media, weathering, and toxic effects on plants. The co-transport of NPs with organic contaminants and heavy metals threaten human health and ecosystems. Furthermore, NPs may serve as a novel habitat for microbial colonization, and may act as carriers for pathogens (i.e., bacteria and viruses). An integrated framework is proposed to better understand the interrelationships between NPs, ecosystems and the human society. In order to fully understand the sources and sinks of NPs, more studies should focus on the total environment, including freshwater, ocean, groundwater, soil and air, and more attempts should be made to explore the aging and aggregation of NPs in environmentally relevant conditions. Considering the fact that naturally-weathered plastic debris may have distinct physicochemical characteristics, future studies should explore the environmental behavior of naturally-aged NPs rather than synthetic polystyrene nanobeads. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

In contrast, few data are available on terrestrial plants, especially on the mechanisms for transport of NPs in plants and phytotoxicity (at both phenotypic and molecular levels) of plants induced by NPs. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a microcosm study in which hydroponically-cultured rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings were exposed to polystyrene (PS)-NPs at 0, 10, 50, and 100 mg L???1 for 16 d and examined for morphological and physiological phenotypes and transcriptomics. Laser confocal scanning micrographs confirmed PS-NPs were uptaken by rice roots, greatly benefitted from the transport activity of aquaporin in rice roots. The significant enhancement (p &lt; 0.05) of antioxidant enzyme activities reflected the oxidative stress response of rice roots upon exposure to PS-NPs. Treatment by PS-NPs decreased root length and increased lateral root numbers. Carbon metabolism was activated (e.g., increased carbon and soluble sugar contents) whereas jasmonic acid and lignin biosynthesis were inhibited. The present study demonstrated the likelihood for transport of PS-NPs in rice roots and induced phytotoxicity by PS-NPs, which should inspire further investigations into the potential human health risks from rice consumption. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Fluorescent microbeads are widely used for tracking in the laboratory, whereas the most abundant microplastic (e.g., fiber) found in the field is rarely adapted. In this study, we used fiber slicer and blades to cut spinning materials into fluorescent micro-sized fibers with various lengths. Fiber slicer and blades are efficient tools to produce specific lengths of fibers. The microfibers showed a specific color under the ultraviolet irradiation; therefore, these microfibers can be clearly visualized when they are within aquatic organisms, such as water flea, shrimp, medaka, and zebrafish, which enables us to observe the whole biological processes of microfibers directly. Thus, the present study provides a novel method of microfibers preparation, and this kind of fluorescent fiber is applicable to be an efficient and convenient tracer for in vivo process observation and potential toxicological analysis in the future. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Recycled fibre is an opportunity to reduce the levels of waste in the world and increase the mechanical performance of the concrete. PET as concrete reinforcement has demonstrated ductility and postcracking strength. However, its performance could be optimized. This study considers a statisticalexperimental analysis to evaluate recycled PET fibre reinforced concrete with various fibre dose and aspect ratio. 120 samples were experimented under workability, compressive, flexural, and splitting tensile tests. The results pointed out that the fibre dose has more influence on the responses than its fibre aspect ratio, with statistical relation on the tensional toughness, equivalent flexural strength ratio, volumetric weight, and the number of fibres. Moreover, the fibre aspect ratio has a statistical impact on the tensional toughness. In general, the data indicates that the optimal recycled PET fibre reinforced concrete generates a superior performance than control samples, with an improvement similar to those reinforced with virgin fibres. ?? 2021 by the authors.

The uneven sizes of plastic particles may affect the ingestion by marine filter feeding bivalves and may lead to differential further physiological effects. To tackle this scientific question, we investigated the size dependent ingestion and dynamic accumulation of nano/micro plastic particles with different diameters (0.07, 0.5, 5, 10 and 100 ??m) in the thick shell mussel Mytilus coruscus. The accumulation of particles in gill, digestive tract and mantle of mussels was measured after 3, 15, 87 h exposure and following 87 h depuration. The results showed that particle ingestion was negatively size dependant and positively related to time in digestive tract. In mantle, particles accumulated over the depuration time with a delay, indicating the translocation of particles. Moreover, our results showed that gill was not a target tissue for steady particle accumulation but the digestive tract was. This study showed size dependent and dynamic ingestion of nano/micro particles in mussels which are one of the main marine organisms for accumulating microplastics. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

The Black Sea drains into the Mediterranean Sea and may therefore significantly contribute to the Mediterranean marine pollution. So far, only very few articles have been published about micro-, meso- and macroplastic abundances in the Western Black Sea. In order to fill this knowledge gap and to decipher the number of plastics on the water surface, 12 samples were collected from surface waters with a neustonic net (mesh size 200 ??m) in the Black Sea close to the Danube Delta and the Romanian shore. Organic matter was digested and plastic particles were isolated by density separation. The results of visual inspection, pyrolysis GC-MS (for microplastics) and ATR-FTIR (for mesoplastics >5 mm) revealed an average concentration of 7 plastic particles/m??, dominated by fibers (???76%), followed by foils (???13%) and fragments (???11%). Only very few spherules were detected. The polymers polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) dominated which is in line with other studies analyzing surface waters from rivers in Western Europe as well as in China. Statistical analyses show that the plastic concentration close to the mouth of the Danube River was significantly higher than at four nearshore regions along the Romanian and Bulgarian coastline. This could be explained by plastic inputs from the Danube River into the western part of the Black Sea. ?? 2020 The Authors",relevant

In this study, 29 commercial fish species (n = 584) with different feeding habits and trophic levels were collected from 8 sites along the Bohai Sea for MP uptake analysis. Approximately 85.4% of the total fish among all species ingested MPs, and there was an average abundance of 2.14 items/individual or 0.043 items/g of wet weight. Compared with other studies, MP pollution in fishes from the Bohai Sea was relatively moderate. The MPs were predominantly fibrous in shape and were cellophane, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) in polymer composition. The highest abundance and polymer composition of MPs was observed in benthivores, suggesting that they might ingest these MPs from their food. The small fish Konosirus punctatus, which had a high level of MPs, may increase the risk of human exposure to the MPs when it is dried and consumed. Moreover, the spatial variation of MPs was determined in terms of abundance, shape composition, and major polymer types, but there was no marked relationship between MP abundance and the trophic levels of fish. Overall, this study provides a basis for the ecological risk assessment of MPs in fish and for a health risk assessment for human beings. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

This study investigated the photo aging process of two common polypropylene (PP) food packaging materials (i.e., meal box and tea cup) in artificial seawater within 12 d of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Results revealed that the aging of both plastic materials were critically inhibited compared with pure PP, indicating that PP food packaging materials in natural seawater may share longer aging time than pure ones. GC-MS analysis revealed that antioxidant Irgafos 168 (tris (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite) was the dominant additive in these plastic materials. Photo reaction between Irgafos 168 and hydroperoxide species on the surface of MPs to prevent the formation of hydroxyl radical was the possible mechanism for the inhibiting effects. After antioxidant was exhausted, its photo degradation products could become the dominant contributor to influence the aging process of MPs. This is the first work exploring the role of antioxidant on the aging process of PP MPs in simulated ocean environment. The findings could be of great help for unraveling the effect of antioxidants on the aging-related environmental risk of hydrocarbon plastics in ocean environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

MPs are about less than 5 mM, have a detrimental impact on marine organisms/products (seafood/sea salts) and therefore they are considered as a global environmental pollutant. The occurrence and impact of MPs in commercial sea salts that are consumed by humans are not well studied so far. In the present study, we attempted to characterize and evaluate the in vitro toxicity of isolated MPs. Here, we have used ten brands of commercial sea salts of different origins for the identification and characterization of MPs. The average abundance of MPs in all commercial brands is &lt; 700 MP/kg and the particle size range between 5.2 mM and 3.8 ??M. The most common types of MPs were identified as fragments, fibers, and pellets. By Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), it was found that the MPs in abundance were made of cellophane (CP), polystyrene (PR), polyamide (PA) and polyarylether (PAR). Further, in vitro toxicity assessment revealed that HEK-293 cells get detached upon treatment with MPs (MIC-75 ??g mL-1) Consequently, the AO/EB dual staining confirmed that the induction and rate of apoptosis were comparatively higher in microplastic treated HEK-293 cells.

Virgin plastics included high and low density polyethylene (HDPE, LDPE), polypropylene (PP) as well as polystyrene (PS). Ocean-harvested plastics were ropes, sheets, foam, pellets and fragmented items previously trawled from the North Pacific Garbage Patch. Nadir viewing angles and plastic pixel coverage were varied to advance our understanding of how reflectance shape and magnitude can be influenced by these parameters. We also investigated the effect of apparent colour of plastics on the measured reflectance from the ultraviolet (UV - 350 nm), visible, near to shortwave infrared (NIR, SWIR - 2500 nm). Statistical analyses indicated that the spectral reflectance of the plastics was significantly correlated to the percentage pixel coverage. There was no clear relationship between the reflectance observed and the viewing nadir angle but dampened materials seemed to be more isotropic (near-Lambertian) than their dry counterparts. A loss in reflectance was also determined between dry and wet plastics. Location of absorption features was not affected by the apparent colour of objects. In general, ocean-harvested plastics shared more identical absorption features ( 960, 1215, 1440, 1732, 1920 nm) and had lower reflectance intensity compared to the virgin plastics ( 980 nm). Prospects for satellite retrieval of plastic type and pixel plastic coverage are discussed based on Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) signal simulated through radiative transfer computation using the documented plastic reflectances. Non-linear relationships between TOA reflectance and plastic coverage were observed depending on wavelength and plastic type. Most of the plastics analysed impact significantly the TOA signal but two plastic types did not produce strong signal at TOA (hard fragments, LDPE). Nevertheless, all plastic types produced detectable signals when observations were simulated within the sunglint direction. The measurements collected in this study are an extension to available high quality spectral reference libraries and can support further research in developing remote sensing algorithms for marine litter. ?? 2020 The Authors",irrelevant

Marine fauna subject to MPs exposure from various environmental sources are most likely to have detrimental effects on their immune system. However, studies of potential risks of MPs on marine ecosystems in light of environmental concentrations are largely limited. To this end, we presented an approach for assessing potential impact of MPs on marine ecosystems based on marine mussel Mytilus-based probabilistic risk assessment framework. The immunotoxic-based biomarkers of Mytilus were used to assess the impact of MPs on marine environment appraised with datasets by compiling oceanic region-specific and comprehensive MPs???environment studies along with published toxicity experiments. The immunological effects of MPs on lysosomal destabilization and phagocytosis in hemocytes of Mytilus were reconstructed as the concentration?€?response functions. We assessed the risk for marine environment exceeding a threshold of Mytilus-based immunological toxicity based on the benchmark concentration (BMC) approach corresponding to a 10% inhibition effect (BMC10). We estimated BMC10 values for inhibitions of lysosomal membrane stability and phagocytosis to be 1.4 and 0.4 mg L???1, respectively. Here we showed that the overall MPs-associated impact potential was low among South Pacific Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and South Atlantic Ocean.

In this study, 100 nm and 1 ??m polystyrene plastics were selected as models to explore the aggregation mechanism of MPs/NPs under different aquatic environments. The influence of ion species and concentrations on the aggregation behaviors and kinetics were systematically investigated to predict the effects of water quality on the occurrence form of MPs and NPs based on DLVO theory and revised modified Smoluchowski theory. Results showed concentration, valence and hydrated ability of cations jointly affected the aggregation behavior of NPs. The critical coagulation concentration ratio of cations were consistent with Schulze-Hardy rules. But the different aggregation rate coefficients of same valent cations were ascribed to the structural layer force. Anion species played a role in the reaction-controlled regime by producing hydrogen ions to neutralize negative charges on NPs surfaces. Due to the strong Brownian motion and structural layer force, NPs would be stable in freshwater but preferentially aggregated when transport through brackish water, estuaries, eutrophication and high hardness areas and sea water, forming the accumulation hot spots of NPs in the sediment. While for MPs, physical process controlled the aggregation mechanism of them, leading to high stability in natural water and eventually transporting into marine environments. This study provided a theoretical foundation for assessing the transport, distribution, fate and ecological risks of MPs and NPs in realistic aquatic environments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

We present here the first environmental risk assessment for marine waters based only on measured concentrations. The Thevariability and uncertainty of the measured data was accounted for in the exposure assessment, while probabilistic species sensitivity distributions were used for hazard assessment, from which a probability distribution was extracted for the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC). By dividing the exposure distribution by the PNEC-distribution, we were able to calculate probabilistic risk characterisation ratios for each water body in which measurements were performed. Results show a good coverage of the world's major water bodies by measured exposure concentrations (MECs), while the hazard assessment could be improved by aligning the type of particles tested in hazard studies (size, form, polymer) to those actually found in the oceans. Overall, the mean predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) is 3.84??106 part m???3, with Oryzias melastigma being the most sensitive species (calculated mean NOEC of 3.90??106 part m???3). Interestingly, the only type of dose descriptor that could be extracted from the literature for particles above 10???20 ??m was the highest observed no effect concentration (HONEC), which indicates a very low or null toxicity of these larger MPs towards marine organisms.

Inside compost facilities, bioplastics that comply with the EN 13432:2000 international standard biodegrade almost completely within 180 days. However, outside compost facilities, and specifically in marine environments, these bioplastics may have a similar effect to that of fossil-fuel based plastics. Here we investigated the effects of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polylactic acid (PLA) single-use cups and plates on a solitary ascidian's biological and ecological features. Both PET and PLA microparticles reduced the fertilization rate of Microcosmus exasperatus, with no significant difference between materials. Accumulation rates in adult M. exasperatus exposed to micronized PET and PLA particles at two concentrations were similar for both the bioplastic material and the conventional plastic particles, with no significant difference between the two materials. A microbial-based digestive protocol was developed in order to recover the bioplastic material from ascidian tissue and reduce any material-loss caused by the known digestion protocols. Finally, PET plates submerged for three months in the Red Sea exhibited a significantly higher community richness and cover area in comparison to PLA plates, which did not provide a firm substrate for settlers. Indeed, coverage by the solitary ascidian Herdmania momus was significantly higher on PET plates. The current study demonstrates that discarded bioplastic products may have similar effects to those of conventional plastics on marine organism fertilization and biological accumulation, emphasizing the need to revise both the production and marketing of ?€?biodegradable?€? and ?€?compostable?€? plastics in order to prevent a further negative impact on ecosystems due to the mismanagement of bioplastic products. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Bioplastic products may have similar effects to those of conventional plastics on marine organism fertilization and biological accumulation, emphasizing the need to revise both the production and marketing of ?€?biodegradable?€? and ?€?compostable?€? plastics. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

Gut retention time of microplastic beads in barnacle naupliar larvae significantly increased with decreasing size. Microbeads resided in digestive tracts generally 3?€?4 times longer in rocky shore and coral reef barnacles than in muddy shore and epibiotic ones.

Scientists have proposed the concept of the ?€?microplastic cycle,?€? but the evidence for the movement of microplastics between different environments is still scarce. By screening the literature and extracting information, we obtained microplastic data from 709 sampling sites in freshwater, seawater, freshwater sediment, sea sediment, and soil in China. Based on the similarity between microplastics and biological communities, here we propose the concept of a ?€?microplastic community?€? and examine the differences, links, and diversity of microplastic communities in different environments. Wilcoxon sign-ranks test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) showed that there were significant differences in abundance, proportion of small microplastics, and community composition (shape, color, and polymer types) of microplastics in different environments. The Mantel test showed that there were significant correlations between microplastic community composition in different environments. Network analysis based on community similarity further confirmed the links between microplastic communities. The distance decay models revealed that the links weakened with the increase of geographic distance, suggesting that sampling sites with closed geographical locations had similar pollution sources and more easily to migrate or exchange microplastics. The microplastic diversity integrated index (MDII) was established based on the diversity of microplastic shape, color, and polymer types, and its indication of the number of microplastic pollution sources was verified by the statistical fitting relationship between the number of industrial pollution sources and MDII. Our study provides new insight into the differences and links between microplastics in different environments, which contributes to the microplastic risk assessment and demonstrates the ?€?microplastic cycle.?€?

Therefore, the present study investigated the occurrence, characteristics, sources, and environmental implications of MPs in the three most common benthic species, namely sea anemone (Actiniidae und.), deposit-feeding starfish (Ctenodiscus crispatus), and snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio), from the Chukchi Sea. The abundances of MPs in the three benthic species were significantly greater than those from the Bering Sea, but lower than those from other regions globally. The top three compositions of MPs in the three species were polyester, nylon, and polyethylene terephthalate. The detection limit for MP size in the present study was 0.03 mm and the mean size of MP in the three species was 0.89 ?? 0.06 mm. The surfaces of MPs found in the starfish and crabs were covered with many attachments, cracks, and hollows, while the surfaces of MPs found in the sea anemones were smooth, which was likely a consequence of different feeding behaviors. There was a significantly positive correlation between the abundances of MPs and other anthropogenic substances. The mean MP abundances in the sea anemones ranged from 0.2 items/individual to 1.7 items/individual, which was significantly higher than that in the deposit-feeding starfish (0.1?€?1.4 items/individual) and snow crabs (0.0?€?0.6 items/individual). Sea anemones inhabiting lower latitudes ingested relatively higher levels of MPs than those inhabiting higher latitudes. The MP abundances in the sea anemones are significantly and positively correlated with the seasonal reduced ratio of sea ice coverage from August to September. Our findings indicate that sea anemones could function as a bioindicator of MP pollution, and that the MPs in the benthos from the Chukchi Sea might originate from the melting sea ice, fishery activities and ocean currents. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",irrelevant

Fluorescence is a sensitive technique that when used with polarity probes can potentially detect low-polarity plastic particles in environments. Here, we evaluated the fluorescence technique to sense polystyrene microparticles directly on salt, silica and sand surfaces, using Nile Red and pyrene as polarity probes. Results show that all probes displayed fluorescence on silica and sand, whereas strong fluorescence quenching was observed on NaCl. Polystyrene particles increase the fluorescence intensity due to probe migration into their nonpolar microenvironment. In the presence of polystyrene, the spectra of Nile Red are shifted to shorter wavelengths, while the ratio of vibronic bands I1/I3 of fluorescence of pyrene decreases to about 1. Pyrene showed similar sensitivity toward surface-modified carboxyl polystyrene particles. On NaCl, the emission of pyrene increases linearly with polystyrene content for concentrations from 0.5 to 20 ??g/g. The detection limit of polystyrene microparticles on natural sea salt using pyrene as probe is about 0.2 ??g/g, while on sand, the sensitivity is about one order of magnitude lower. Overall, although being of relatively low selectivity, the fluorescence technique can be used to determine a maximum content of plastic particles of few micrometers size with little sample preparation. Fluorescence, when used in conjunction with pyrene probe, allows for detection and quantification of microplastic particles in the sub-ppm range. ?? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",irrelevant

It consisted of 2520 h cyclical weathering, alternating the sample between a salt spray and a Xenon-chamber?€?this corresponds to roughly 3?€?4 years on the surface of an ocean. It was proved that the molecular weight of PET is a function of weathering time and can be described mathematically. Microscopic examination of the surface of the PET bottles and HDPE caps proved that these surfaces were damaged. After weathering, manufacturing tests were performed on the PET material by extrusion, injection moulding, 3D printing and thermoforming. Quantitative comparison between products manufactured by the same technology was performed in order to compare the qualities of products made from original PET, non-weathered PET waste, which was the example of classical recycling, and weathered PET. In the case of products made from weathered PET, certain mechanical and optical properties (e.g. impact strength and transparency) were significantly impaired compared to the original PET and the recycled, non-weathered PET. Certain other properties (e.g. strength and rigidity) did not change significantly.

DBP degradation percentage was enhanced by 0.2% microplastics (7.3?€?11.0% increment) but was reduced by 2?€?10% microplastics (3.7?€?27.7% decrement). Meanwhile, addition of microplastics with higher sorption ability to DBP led to lower DBP degradation percentage. The initial concentration of bioavailable DBP in sediments decreased with the increase of microplastic sorption ability to DBP and microplastic concentration. Microbial community structure was more significantly influenced by microplastic type than by microplastic concentration. Significant positive correlation was observed between the total relative abundances of dominant DBP-degraders and DBP degradation percentage. The results indicated that the changes in DBP degradation percentage were related to both DBP bioavailability and the total relative abundances of dominant DBP-degraders.

While research is concerned with the fate of marine litter in the environment, recycling of these materials after collection is rarely addressed, mainly because there is neither considerable data on composition nor a suggested process to do so. This study is the first to analyse and evaluate chemical recycling (pyrolysis, gasification) and energy recovery (incineration) of marine litter.

Simultaneously, antibiotics and heavy metals could often be detected in the environment. They are both positively charged, it is necessary to clarify the interactions of these pollutants with microplastics when they were coexist. In this study, the most commonly used polystyrene (PS) was selected as a representative microplastic. This study investigated the effect of Cd(II) on the sorption of TYL by PS in different coexistence systems. The results showed that: in the composite system, when TYL and Cd(II) coexist, the presence of Cd(II) could inhibit the sorption of TYL by PS, and the inhibitory effect increases with the increase of the concentration of Cd(II), indicating that competitive sorption dominates the sorption. When PS adsorbed Cd(II) first and then adsorbed TYL, the presence of Cd(II) was conducive to the sorption of TYL, and the sorption strengthened with the increase of Cd(II) concentration, indicating that the complexation between TYL and Cd(II) enhanced the sorption of TYL.

Nevertheless, microbial community succession and assembly among different microplastics in nearshore mariculture cages remains poorly understood. Using an in situ incubation experiment, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the neutral model, we investigated the prokaryotic communities attached to polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP) in a mariculture cage in Xiangshan Harbor, China. The ??-diversities and compositions of microplastic-attached prokaryotic communities were significantly distinct from free-living and small particle-attached communities in the surrounding water but relatively similar to the large particle-attached communities. Although a distinct prokaryotic community was developed on each type of microplastic, the communities on PE and PP more closely resembled each other. Furthermore, the prokaryotic community dissimilarity among all media (microplastics and water fractions) tended to decrease over time. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria Alcanivorax preferentially colonized PE, and the genus Vibrio with opportunistically pathogenic members has the potential to colonize PET. Additionally, neutral processes dominated the prokaryotic community assembly on PE and PP, while selection was more responsible for the prokaryotic assembly on PET.

Sponges, aquatic filter-feeding animals, are able to incorporate fine foreign particles, and thus may be a potential bioindicator for microparticulate pollutants. To address this question, 15 coral reef demosponges sampled around Bangka Island (North Sulawesi, Indonesia) were analyzed for the nature of their foreign particle content using traditional histological methods, advanced light microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Sampled sponges accumulated and embedded the very fine sediment fraction (<200 ??m), absent in the surrounding sand, in the ectosome (outer epithelia) and spongin fibers (skeletal elements), which was confirmed by two-photon microscopy. A total of 34 different particle types were identified, of which degraded man-made products, i.e., polystyrene, particulate cotton, titanium dioxide and blue-pigmented particles, were incorporated by eight specimens at concentrations between 91 and 612 particle/g dry sponge tissue. As sponges can weigh several hundreds of grams, we conservatively extrapolate that sponges can incorporate on average 10,000 microparticulate pollutants in their tissue. The uptake of particles, however, appears independent of the material, which suggests that the fluctuation in material ratios is due to the spatial variation of surrounding microparticles. Therefore, particle-bearing sponges have a strong potential to biomonitor microparticulate pollutants, such as microplastics and other degraded industrial products. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

As MPs abundance in rivers had the same seasonality as found in the inner bay, rivers were considered the main source of MPs. The seawater residence time is shorter than the time required for the density of MPs to become greater than that of seawater; therefore, it was considered that MPs are transported out of the bay instead of sinking.

5L47MRSU,10.3390/microorganisms9010076,Vibrio colonization is highly dynamic in early microplastic-associated biofilms as well as on field-collected microplastics,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems and provide a habitat for biofilm-forming bacteria. The genus Vibrio, which includes potential pathogens, was detected irregularly on microplastics. Since then, the potential of microplastics to enrich (and serve as a vector for) Vibrio has been widely discussed. We investigated Vibrio abundance and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) composition on polyethylene and polystyrene within the first 10 h of colonization during an in situ incubation experiment, along with those found on particles collected from the Baltic Sea. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and co-occurrence networks to elaborate the role of Vibrio within biofilms. Colonization of plastics with Vibrio was detectable after one hour of incubation; however, Vibrio numbers and composition were very dynamic, with a more stable population at the site with highest nutrients and lowest salinity. Likewise, Vibrio abundances on field-collected particles were variable but correlated with proximity to major cities. Vibrio was poorly connected within biofilm networks. Taken together, this indicates that Vibrio is an early colonizer of plastics, but that the process is undirected and independent of the specific surface. Still, higher nutrients could enhance a faster establishment of Vibrio populations. These parameters should be considered when planning studies investigating Vibrio on microplastics. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",irrelevant

In this study we first reported environmental baseline data on the occurrence and characterization of ???oating MPs in Italian coastal waters of the Central Adriatic Sea by using a standardized monitoring protocol. Further, we analyzed the concentrations of MP-associated chemicals and evaluated their potential adipogenic effects using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. MPs were found in each sampling stations showing the highest abundance (1.88 ?? 1.78 items/m3) in the sites more distant from the coast with fragments as the most common shape category. All targeted organic pollutants (i.e. polychlorinated biphenyls - PCBs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -PAHs, organophosphorus - OP, and organochlorine - OC pesticides) have been detected on the surface of the collected MPs. The highest concentrations of PAHs were found on MPs from inshore (i.e. &lt;1.5 NM) surface waters with low-ring PAHs as dominant components. Similarly, MPs from inshore waters had higher ??PCB concentrations (64.72 ng/g plastic) than those found in offshore (i.e. &gt;6 NM) waters (10.37 ng/g plastic). Among pesticides, all measured OPs were detected in each sample analyzed with pirimiphos-methyl as the most representative compound. For OCs, the sum of all concentrations of congeners was higher in coastal with respect to offshore waters. Moreover, in vitro 3T3-L1 screening of MP extracts indicated potential metabolic effects resulting in both adipogenesis and lipid uptake/storage. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",relevant

Litter quantity and composition was found to differ significantly among subregions, indicating the need for targeted measures to reduce litter inputs in the marine environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd The main objective of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) was to achieve a Good Environmental Status (GES) in European waters by 2020, according to 11 descriptors. Descriptor 10 is related to marine litter and envisages that the properties and quantities of marine litter are at a level that does not cause harm to the coastal and marine environment. Even if GES was not achieved by 2020, the first MSFD implementation cycle filled many gaps in knowledge. Here we present the first data (2015?€?2018) on beach litter densities along Italian coasts and discuss lessons learnt and future perspectives. The beach litter median density was 477 items/100 m (interquartile range: 261?€?934 items/100 m), but subregional differences emerged both in terms of litter quantities and composition. The Adriatic Sea was the most polluted subregion (590 items/100 m), followed by the Western Mediterranean Sea (491 items/100 m) and the Ionian Sea and Central Mediterranean Sea subregion (274 items/100 m). A high presence of aquaculture-related litter (mainly mussel nets) characterised beaches in the Adriatic Sea. At the same time, the numbers of cotton bud sticks were extremely high in some beaches of the Western Mediterranean Sea. General litter (items discarded or left by the public on the coast or inland and carried by winds and rivers or objects originating from tourism and recreation at land or sea, poor waste management practices, etc.) was the most common litter typology (38.8%). The results of this study represent the first baseline to compare achievement towards GES in the next years and the efficacy of the program of measures which entered into force in 2016, concerning beach litter densities and composition. They also highlight the necessity of a joint effort for deploying harmonised marine litter monitoring methodologies across the European Member States to obtain comparable results. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",relevant

Here we investigate the destiny of ALDFGs in a coralligenous benthic community by studying the biofouling growing on them at 30 m depth over a three-year period. Results indicate that ALDFGs are quickly covered by biofouling, reaching maximum values of cover in one year. At this depth, the biofouling community results highly influenced by light-dependent seasonal cycles and a general four-steps colonization scheme is tentatively depicted: i) biofouling community is initially dominated by fast-growing organisms, with algae and hydrozoans settling after two weeks; ii) small-sized carbonatic organisms (e.g. bryozoans) appear after two months; iii) the same organisms (including coralline algae) become abundant after five to eight months; iv) conspicuous carbonatic skeletons (serpulids, bivalves and bryozoans) occur after one year increasing in complexity in the following months. The biofouling settled on ALDFGs, as well as growth rates of large carbonatic species, could provide useful information to estimate the age of lost lines and nets in retrieved material and in situ photo footage complementing the overview of the fishing impact in this specific environment. Finally, no signs of nylon degradation are reported, suggesting that the prevailing physical conditions and the biofouling cover extent could alter microplastics release from nylon ALDFGs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd biofouling colonization patterns and growth rates are used to evaluate the fate of abandoned, lost or otherwise discharged fishing gears. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

Polymer assessment may assist in identifying sources and may indicate risks from additives occurring in specific types of polymers. Using known test materials, two identification methods Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and near infrared spectroscopy (FTIR and NIR) were compared. Although both methods were found to be similarly suitable for identification of plastic polymers, a significant difference was observed in identification of natural materials. FTIR frequently misclassified natural materials as being a synthetic polymer. Within our results, an 80% match score threshold functioned best to distinguish between natural items and synthetics. Using NIR, the historical variability of plastics ingested by northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) from the Dutch sector of the North Sea was analysed for three time periods since the 1980s. For the more recent decade, variability between fulmars from different regions in the northeast Atlantic was investigated. Regional variation was further explored by analysing plastics obtained from the stomachs of southern hemisphere relatives of the fulmar (southern fulmar, cape petrel, snow petrel) and Wilson?€?s storm petrel. Results show that proportional abundance of polymer types in these seabirds is closely related to the plastic categories that they ingest (e.g. pellets, foam, fragments). The uptake of different plastic categories and related polymer types most likely reflects spatial and temporal variations in availability rather than ingestion preferences of the birds. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",irrelevant

Q7W8Q2K4,10.1007/s11625-020-00841-7,Volunteer beach cleanups: civic environmental stewardship combating global plastic pollution,"Marine litter, the majority of which is plastic, is one of the most pressing global environmental challenges impacting the planet. One way coastal communities respond to this challenge is through the environmental stewardship practice of volunteer beach cleanups. Beyond providing temporarily cleaner local beaches, how might these beach cleanups have broader impacts in the global struggle against plastic pollution? Using the lenses of environmental stewardship and civic ecology, we conducted a content analysis of primary source materials created by 50 groups involved in volunteer beach cleanups. We collected data on the scale at which groups coordinate volunteer beach cleanups, the roles they play in conducting these cleanups, how they interact with other volunteer beach cleanup groups, and the other forms of stewardship they conduct, if any. Within our sample, we identified groups coordinating volunteer beach cleanups at five geographic scales: local, sub-national, national, multi-national, and global. Within the groups operating at each scale, we found groups conducting environmental stewardship in the forms of education, advocacy, research, and monitoring in addition to their conservation work through beach cleanups. Our findings demonstrate that groups branch out their impacts by combining different forms of environmental stewardship targeting plastic pollution, and they collaborate to scale up their actions in ways that contribute to plastic pollution governance. Connecting these findings with the literature on the broader impacts of civic ecology practices allows us to theorize how volunteer beach cleanup groups branch out and scale up their efforts to weave a global net of ocean stewardship. ?? 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",irrelevant

In this study, we intended to reveal that the latest EPS microplastic pollution status on 5 island beaches in the Pearl River Estuary, China, by comprehensively assessing the abundance, distribution, size, surface texture and carrying capacity of heavy metals (Cd, As, Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb, Mn, Fe, Al).

These fragments are often colonized by bacterial species in marine environments, possibly contributing to the biodegradation of such materials. However, further investigations are necessary to determine the impact of abiotic polymer weathering on biofilm adhesion, as well as the specific biofilm formation strategies employed by marine isolates. Here, we evaluate deep-sea sediment bacterial isolates for biofilm adhesion, extracellular matrix production, and polymer degradation ability. Our study focuses on high-density polyethylene (HDPE) fragments for their high durability and environmental persistence, subjecting fragments to abiotic weathering prior to bacterial colonization. Marine isolates identified as Pseudomonas sp. and Lysinibacillus sp. exhibited decreasing biofilm formation on weathered HDPE, especially over the first 24 h of incubation. This effect was countered by increased extracellular matrix production, likely improving cell adhesion to surfaces roughened by abiotic degradation. These adhesion strategies were contrasted with a reference Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, which displayed high levels of biofilm formation on non-weathered HDPE and lower extracellular matrix production over the first 24 h of incubation. Furthermore, our results suggest that an increase in biofilm biomass correlated with changes to HDPE structure, indicating that these strains have a potential for biodegradation of plastic fragments. Therefore, this work provides a detailed account of biofilm formation strategies and bacteria-plastic interactions that represent crucial steps in the biodegradation of plastic fragments in marine environments. ?? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",irrelevant

The strain grew on a mineral medium supplemented with poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] as the sole carbon source. Genetic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the strain belongs to the genus Nocardioides. In addition, the average nucleotide identity value of the two genomes of the strain OK12 and Nocardioides marinisabuli DSM 18965, a marine species, was 98.3 %, above the 95 % threshold.

The strain grew and degraded P(3HB) in a broad range of NaCl concentrations (0.01?€?2.4 M), whereas it did not grow without NaCl, suggesting that the strain is a marine species. The strain degraded the P(3HB) film at a fast rate, despite the fact that the P(3HB) degrading activity in the culture supernatant was low.

In this study, a range of fragments of EPS and XPS retrieved from three beaches in southwest England have been characterised by energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry in order to examine the chemical makeup and potential biological and geochemical impacts and interactions of this type of plastic waste. Analyses performed through sample faces and, in some cases and after dissection, through the material core, revealed variable concentrations of Fe, Ti and Zn among the fragments and, in many instances, within the same sample. This likely reflects the presence of reaction residues and pigments arising from the manufacture of polystyrene, and, for Fe and Ti, significant and heterogeneous ion and mineral acquisition from the environment during transport in suspension or while beached. Acquired oxides of Fe are partly responsible for the chemical fouling observed on the face of most samples and are able to act as an adsorbent for other metals, like Pb. Detection of Br in many fragments up to concentrations of 11,500 mg kg???1 likely results from the incorporation of the flame retardant, hexabromocyclododecane, in EPS and XPS designed for (but not necessarily limited to) the construction sector.

The modelled data are confronted with experimental values. It is mandatory to consider this increase in water content in order to be able to predict chain scission at a high level of degradation. It appears that in the absence of oxygen, hydrolysis in polyamide 6 is a slow process when the pH is neutral (7 pH) and obeys an Arrhenius law with an activation energy of 106 kJ/mol.

Phase mapping, stiffness measurements, and thermal analysis were conducted with atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the physical properties of the sea-island structures. The internal adhesive structure observed by AFM was in good agreement with the transmission electron microscopy analyses. The structure of the adhesive-adherend interface that showed a good bonding strength was similar to the internal structure, forming a large acrylic-rich island and rubber-rich sea. In the case of plastics with low surface energies, however, the interface formed a distinctive structure with small acrylic islands in a rubber sea. The difference in the formation of the sea-island structure is considered to be related to the wettability of the adhesive to the adherends, and it was revealed that a stronger interface corresponds to a structure more closely resembling that of the inside. ?? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",irrelevant
FFWX7G78,10.1002/ieam.4325,Methods Matter: Methods for Sampling Microplastic and Other Anthropogenic Particles and Their Implications for Monitoring and Ecological Risk Assessment,"To inform mitigation strategies and understand how microplastics affect wildlife, research is focused on understanding the sources, pathways, and occurrence of microplastics in the environment and in wildlife. Microplastics research entails counting and characterizing microplastics in nature, which is a labor-intensive process, particularly given the range of particle sizes and morphologies present within this diverse class of contaminants. Thus, it is crucial to determine appropriate sampling methods that best capture the types and quantities of microplastics relevant to inform the questions and objectives at hand. It is also critical to follow protocols with strict quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) measures so that results reflect accurate estimates of microplastic contamination. Here, we assess different sampling procedures and QA/QC strategies to inform best practices for future environmental monitoring and assessments of exposure. We compare microplastic abundance and characteristics in surface-water samples collected using different methods (i.e., manta and bulk water) at the same sites, as well as duplicate samples for each method taken at the same site and approximate time. Samples were collected from 9 sampling sites within San Francisco Bay, California, USA, using 3 different sampling methods: 1) manta trawl (manta), 2) 1-L grab (grab), and 3) 10-L bulk water filtered in situ (pump). Bulk water sampling methods (both grab and pump) captured more microplastics within the smaller size range (<335 ??m), most of which were fibers. Manta samples captured a greater diversity of morphologies but underestimated smaller-sized particles. Inspection of pump samples revealed high numbers of particles from procedural contamination, stressing the need for robust QA/QC, including sampling and analyzing laboratory blanks, field blanks, and duplicates. Choosing the appropriate sampling method, combined with rigorous, standardized QA/QC practices, is essential for the future of microplastics research in marine and freshwater ecosystems.

In this work, a fiberglass-reinforced polyamide 6,6 matrix, loaded with innovative flame retardants based on nanosized organoclays has been evaluated as a replacement for aluminum in a marine engine cover. Experimental data were acquired to assess the mechanical performances and flammability properties of this novel polymer nanocomposite in comparison with those of a commercial sample based on the same polymeric matrix loaded with traditional flame retardants. The results showed that then use of nanoclays in place of standard flame retardants increased the mechanical properties of the polymer nanocomposite at all tested temperatures (22% of modulus increase at 20 ??C, 93% at 110 ??C), concomitantly meeting the minimum nonflammability requirements (self-extinguishing, without dropping of flammable material). ?? 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.",irrelevant
SFVIRXJY,10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.105219,The dynamics of plastic pellets on sandy beaches: A new methodological approach,"Plastic found in the coastal zone is a result of waste mismanagement. This material comes directly from offshore disposal or by fishing debris, other marine activities, and by marine currents and winds, as well as urban drainage systems and estuaries. Specifically, in the case of plastic pellets, which are spheres with 2?€?5 mm that constitute the raw material for the manufacture of plastic products, the Santos Port and the plastic factories in Cubat??o city (Brazilian southeastern coast), are considered the main local sources for the S??o Paulo state coast. Consequently, the beaches most affected by this pollutant are those near Santos estuary, like Enseada do Guaruj?? beach. However, some questions are still open, such as: what are the mechanisms which control the pellets deposition, and which locations are most favorable for deposition on the beach? To answer these questions, a four-step research was carried out at Enseada beach: 1) Plastic pellets geodetic survey based on GNSS positioning; 2) Beach geomorphometric parameters (altitude, aspect, and slope) derived by Digital Elevation Model (DEM); 3) Strandline altitude estimated through wave climate and tide height; and, 4) Plastic pellets deposition Suitability Index (PSI). The joint analysis of the altimetric, geomorphometric and meteoceanographic aspects showed that the beach areas with altitudes higher than those calculated for the strandline (>2.06 m), slope 3?? and facing the same direction of the higher energy waves (157.5?€?202.5??) were more susceptible to pellet deposition. This indicates that the accumulation of this pollutant on the beach is controlled not only by its physical characteristics, but mainly by storm surge events. Besides, surveys with geodetic reference (fixed, univocal, and relatively stable on time) bring up altimetric information as a result of all interactions and can be compared with other beaches anywhere on the planet ?€? thus contributing to a standardization of the survey methodology. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",uncertain
YYC57C5S,10.1007/s11356-020-12100-4,"Factors influencing the vertical distribution of microplastics in the beach sediments around the Ras Rakan Island, Qatar","Microplastic (MP) pollution is an emerging environmental problem, particularly in the marine environment, and nations are concerned about this issue. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the vertical distribution of MPs present in the beach sediments around the Ras Rakan Island of Qatar. Sampling was conducted at 9 locations, vertically to a depth of 30 cm with an interval of 5 cm. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to chemically identify the subsets of MPs as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polystyrene (EPS). The counts of MPs were found to be higher in the western and northern parts of the island. The vertical distribution of MPs ranged from 0 to 665 particles/kilogram with maximum abundance at the surface layer (0?€?5 cm). Pellets were the dominant type of MPs in the surface sediments, whereas fibers were dominant in the bottom sediments. The prevailing winds, waves, tides, and currents are the forces responsible for the distribution and transport of MPs from offshore to the island and further to vertical re-distribution as time progresses. The level of MP pollution along the coast of Ras Rakan Island was higher than that found on the coast of mainland Qatar. Thus, informing that remote islands should also be considered for MP pollution monitoring programs to assess the risk associated with MP on the biota. ?? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",relevant

Furthermore, it has also severely impacted the previously on-going global efforts to reduce the use of plastic waste. During the period of the whole COVID-19, the sustainable measures and products adopted for the conservation of our land and marine ecosystem are being neglected or at the very least, kept on hold. The use of plastic-based personal protective equipment (PPEs) and sanitizers by health-care professionals and the public has led to a huge surge in a plastic waste generation without any plans to mitigate its severity. It is vital to understand the impact of this problem and find the possible solutions. The sudden escalation in medical plastic waste makes it difficult to follow the protocol of medical plastic waste handling in the civic waste management system. In this article all plastic waste management issues faced globally, especially in the developing world, have been highlighted. Moreover, in the end, some possible solutions have been recommended for the safe handling of plastic wastes in the civic society such as plastic waste management system, the use of artificial intelligence from generation to disposal, etc. In addition, the steps to produce a zero waste society have been recommended. This study emphasizes not only government institutes and technological centers but also on the common citizens to make a sustainable civic society. ?? 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",irrelevant

More than 80% of marine litter is made of plastics, 70% of which originates from disposable items, so plastic disposables need to be replaced with disposables made from renewable materials. However, it is important to investigate the environmental impact of renewable alternatives through their life cycle, in order to support sustainable consumption and production. In this study, the carbon footprint of disposable plates made from two different renewable materials (paper, tree leaves) were analysed using life cycle assessment. The leaf plate was produced in India and the paper plate in Finland, but both were used and disposed of in Sweden. The results showed that the leaf plate had higher carbon footprint, due to long-distance transport and use of fossil fuel-based electricity for production. Scenario analysis indicated that the emissions associated with the leaf plate were lower when replacing air freight with sea transport and with economies of scale in expanded production. For the paper plate, the processing stage was shown to contribute most life cycle emissions. These could be lowered by applying a biodegradable coating. In comparison the leaf plate had the benefit of being biodegradable, but this benefit was not enough to compete with the paper plate which was consider the less environmentally damaging alternative. However, in order to increase sustainability in the food supply chain, it will not be enough to just improve the material use for single use plates, especially since the idea of single use materials could be seen as less sustainable, but improved materials have the potential to offset the anticipated growth of the food service sector where single use items are widely used. ?? 2020 The Authors",irrelevant

To reduce plastic pollution, biodegradable polymers are in high demand as alternatives for common plastics. In this work, we study the degradability of poly(glycerol maleate)(PGM) in various aqueous environments to evaluate the influence of salinity and microorganisms on the degradation. PGM films are immersed in reverse osmosis (R.O.) water, fresh water, tap water, artificial seawater and seawater at 25 ??C for 56 days. The mechanism of the degradation is discussed through mass remaining (%), water uptake (%), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and surface morphology via scanning electron microscope (SEM). It is revealed that PGM degrades efficiently in seawater and freshwater environments. Furthermore, with the presence of microorganisms, the degradation of PGM in seawater is slightly retarded, with over 95% of PGM films degraded within 56 days. Overall, PGM shows great potential as a biodegradable polymer that degrades rapidly in aqueous environments, regardless of the presences of microorganisms. ?? 2020",irrelevant

In this work, a novel surface-active copolymer basing on hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and hydrophobic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) was designed and incorporated into a crosslinked PDMS matrix to form a surface-renewable antifouling coating. In the copolymer, PVP segments possessed a chemical stability and could prevent the settlement of fouling organisms attributable to its strong hydrophilicity; PDMS endowed the copolymer with compatibility to PDMS matrix and could efficiently reduce the fouling adhesion strength attributable to the low surface energy. Based on the surface-active copolymer, the coating could be reconstructed underwater in response to the environment forming a renewable surface to promote the fouling-release property. In addition, a set of controllable composition coatings were prepared to investigate the effects of surface chemistry on antifouling and fouling-release performance. Laboratory bioassays against marine unicellular diatom adhesion (???99 % reduction) and mimetic barnacle attachment (???81 % reduction) demonstrated an outstanding antifouling and fouling-release property of the copolymer-based coating compared to pristine PDMS, and the coating with a higher PVP content exhibited a better performance.

However, the impact of using various grocery bags in cities with dense population, well-developed infrastructure and thermal treatment as an end-of-life waste management option has been insufficiently documented. In this study, commonly found single-use (HDPE, biodegradable plastic, kraft paper) bags and reusable (cotton, polypropylene non-woven) bags were considered for the life cycle assessment (LCA). The usage characteristics (reusability, dimensions, carrying capacity) of bags, the production process (raw materials extraction, production processes), and emissions were determined as the significant factors contributing to the negative environmental impacts. In a model city with confined waste management, the assessment determined that the reusable polypropylene non-woven bag (PNB) caused the least overall negative environmental impacts when there are 50 instances of reuse, followed by single use HDPE plastic bag (HPB). The global warming potential (excluding biogenic carbon) was 14, 81, 17 and 16 times higher for HDPE plastic, kraft paper, cotton woven and biodegradable polymer bags, respectively, when compared to PNB. Moreover, kraft paper or cotton woven bags demonstrated the highest negative impacts for the impact categories including abiotic fossil depletion, freshwater-, marine- and terrestrial-ecotoxicities, human toxicity, acidification and eutrophication potentials. Further, sensitivity analysis indicated that the inflexion point for the PNB was minimum 4 reuses to avoid emission equivalent to the HPB.

Urbanization enhances waste production, leading to the opening of landfills that constitute a spatially and temporally predictable food source for opportunistic species. Several species of gulls are known to exploit and breed in urban areas, taking advantage of accessible and diverse food resources. The exploitation of anthropogenic food subsidies at sea (e.g. fishery discards), urban sites, and landfills leads to debris ingestion by gulls with potential negative effects. Here we characterize anthropogenic debris ingested by yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) along Portugal, by analysing the content of pellets collected in (1) natural and urban breeding locations, and in (2) urban and landfill resting sites, to assess seasonal patterns in the ingestion of anthropogenic debris. We also relate diet with the presence of anthropogenic debris. Debris materials were found in 28.8% of pellets from breeding locations (natural and urban) and in 89.7% of pellets from resting sites (urban and landfill). Gulls from the most urbanized breeding location exhibited higher levels of ingested materials during the entire breeding cycle, however, gulls from a natural breeding site also ingested high levels of debris during the pre-breeding season. At resting sites, small seasonal differences were detected in the number and mass of debris items ingested, which were both higher during spring and summer. Gulls that typically fed on pelagic fish had significantly less sheet and fragment plastics in their pellets. The presence of certain debris categories in gull pellets was positively related to the presence of some prey items, suggesting that gulls may accidentally ingest debris while foraging at multiple habitats. The quantity of anthropogenic materials ingested by gulls from urban locations and landfills indicates a need for improved waste management. ?? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",irrelevant

In this study, well integrity under various reservoir compaction patterns for the Nankai Trough case is examined using a well-formation finite element model. The modelling details include the inclusion of a cement sheath as well as the modelling of construction processes (such as cement shrinkage). Well elongation in the overburden layer becomes significant when the reservoir subsidence is localized near the wellbore under large depressurization. Results show that the maximum plastic deviatoric strain level in the cement could reach 0.7% when the maximum reservoir subsidence reaches 0.85 m and cement shrinkage is limited. When cement shrinkage rises to 0.75%, the maximum plastic deviatoric strain increases to 2.4% as the cement accumulates additional plastic strain during shrinkage due to its deformation being constrained by the casing. In order to prevent the cement from failure, it might be effective to hold the pressure drawdown at a low level (e.g., several MPa) until the hydrate dissociation front advances to a certain radius from the well (e.g., a couple of tens of metres). ?? 2020",irrelevant

Phenotypically plastic defences often come with trade-offs related to foraging, such that the magnitude of defence is mediated by body condition and food availability. Such adaptive responses are beneficial to prey, and there is an increasing appreciation that they can be disrupted by chemical compounds resulting from human activities. We examined predator-induced behaviours in freshwater snails (Physa acuta) using 32 combinations of different concentrations of olfactory predator cues, body condition and food availability to understand how they respond to the trade-off between avoiding predators and obtaining food. Using a subset of these conditions (16 environments), we then examined how snail responses were altered by increases or decreases in pH. We found that snails responded to increased predator cue concentrations with a shape consistent with a saturating response curve and that low body condition and low food availability weakened these responses. When we increased pH (from 7.8 to 9.5), snails exhibited weaker predator avoidance responses, but only in the absence of food. When we decreased pH (from 7.8 to 6.0), snails exhibited stronger predator avoidance responses and stronger declines in foraging, but only in the presence of food. Collectively, these results suggest that changes in pH due to acid mine drainage, eutrophication and ocean acidification may substantially alter the adaptive responses of aquatic animals. Future work should determine whether such info-disruption is common in other taxa, determine the underlying mechanisms and quantify the consequences of info-disruption to predator?€?prey and prey?€?resource interactions. ?? 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour",irrelevant

This study experimentally investigates the durability of CRS concrete beams reinforced with basalt FRP (BFRP) bars in a simulated marine environment. Flexural tests are conducted on a total of fourteen CRS concrete beams aged in a cyclic wet-dry saline solution at temperatures of 25, 40 and 55??C. The variables comprise the types of reinforcement (steel and BFRP), the aging duration and the temperature. The failure modes, capacities, deflections and crack development of the beams are analysed and discussed. The results indicate that the ultimate load of the beams exhibits no degradation after aging, whereas the failure mode of the BFRP-CRS concrete beams transition from flexure to shear, which is caused by the degradation in the mechanical properties of the stirrups. The aged BFRP-CRS concrete beams show a substantial increase of over 70% in their initial stiffness compared with the control beams (beams without aging) and a substantial decrease in their crack width after aging due to the prolonged maturation of the concrete. Furthermore, a formula for calculating the shear capacity in the existing code is modified by a partial factor equal to 2, which can predict the capacity of a CRS concrete beam reinforced with BFRP bars in a marine environment. ??

While the density of composites increases with the increase in the plant fiber content, the chemical foaming injection process was used to prepare straw fiber/PP foamed composites with exothermic foaming agent azodicarbonamide, in order to reduce the density of composite products and meet the requirements for lightweight automotive trim parts. The effects of temperature and fiber content on the mechanical properties and microstructures of the composites were investigated. Research results show that the microporous straw fiber/PP composites have close bond with the core layer fibers, the matrix, and the cells. The cells evenly distributed around the fibers to form a ?€?sea island?€? phase structure of the fiber microporous matrix, and the toughness of microporous sample is better than solid composites. Within a certain range, the cell density and the impact resistance of the microporous composites increases first and then decreases as the molding temperature increases, and maximize at 185 ??C. Straw fiber plays a role of nucleation and toughening in the microporous straw fiber/PP composite system. And as its content increases, the cell density increases, similarly the toughness of the composites increases. ?? 2020 The Textile Institute.",irrelevant
78B2D286,10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2020.105994,Improving the energy absorption capacity of square CFRP tubes with cutout by introducing chamfer,"Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tubes have been widely used as energy absorption devices. Because it is inclined to deform in progressive crushing mode (PCM) with low initial peak force Fp and high specific energy absorption SEA (the energy absorption per unit mass). In many cases, cutouts are introduced into these tubes to meet engineering requirements. However, the cutouts can cause a collapse in the middle height (i.e., mid-height collapse mode), and thus the SEA of the CFRP tubes is even reduced by 56%. Therefore, in this research, a chamfer is introduced into the CFRP tubes with cutout to trigger the PCM, thereby increasing the energy absorption capacity. A series of validation experiments show that the chamfer can trigger the PCM with about 64% decrease of Fp and 52% increase of SEA. The parameter study is conducted to investigate the effect of size and position of the cutout on the energy absorption of CFRP tubes with a 45-degree chamfer. The result indicates that the chamfer can eliminate the negative effects of cutouts and improve the energy absorption capacity in most cases. Furthermore, the contrastive analysis between CFRP and metal tubes reveals the difference in energy absorption characteristics of these two types of tubes and further explains the advantages of energy absorption of the CFRP tubes with a 45-degree chamfer and a cutout. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant
AYV5QDEZ,10.1002/pen.25642,Viscosity decrease by interfacial slippage between immiscible polymers,"The rheological behavior under pressure-driven shear flow was studied using binary blends with a sea-island structure. The addition of a low-viscosity dispersion having a high interfacial tension with the continuous phase greatly reduces the shear viscosity, for example, the addition of atactic polystyrene (PS) with a low viscosity to isotactic polypropylene (PP) and the addition of PP with a low viscosity to PS. The interfacial slippage occurs because of the poor adhesive strength with the enlarged interfacial area and is responsible for the viscosity decrease. When the dispersion has a similar viscosity to the continuous phase, the viscosity decrease is barely detected. This is because the deformation of dispersed droplets is restricted, which creates a small interfacial area. The interfacial tension between the continuous and dispersed phases plays a crucial role on the shear viscosity. In the case of PP, the addition of linear low-density polyethylene with a relatively low interfacial tension to PP has almost no impact on the shear viscosity. This is despite the polyethylene having a low viscosity. ?? 2021 Society of Plastics Engineers",irrelevant
ES9BMBMZ,10.1016/j.soildyn.2020.106437,Cyclic performance of a monopile in spatially variable clay using an advanced constitutive model,"The performance of monopiles in cohesive soils is of great interest for future offshore wind farm developments, particularly under the cyclic loads experienced in the ocean environment. Clay behaviour during undrained cyclic loading is complex and involves the accumulation of plastic strains, generation of excess pore-water pressures and degradation of initial stiffness. In this paper, the cyclic performance of a laterally-loaded monopile in spatially variable clay is investigated for the first time. A kinematic hardening constitutive model is used in a 3D finite element analysis to capture the hysteretic stress-strain behaviour of the clay. The monopile is installed in overconsolidated London Clay, which is present at several offshore wind farms in the Thames Estuary. The finite element model is coupled with random field representations of initial stiffness and clay structure. The statistical characterisation of the random fields was undertaken considering parameter ranges observed in laboratory tests. Under one-way cyclic loading, the monopile showed ratcheting behaviour, where pile rotation accumulates with increasing numbers of load cycles. The cyclic secant stiffness also increased due to the generation of negative excess pore-pressures in the clay. This behaviour occurred in both homogeneous and spatially variable clay. The monopile was also subjected to an extreme dynamic event and the soil response around the monopile showed increasing variability in stress-strain response and generation of excess pore-water pressure over time as plastic strain accumulated. However, the overall behaviour of the foundation was governed by a spatial average of the mobilised clay. The range in monopile response demonstrates how the natural spatial variability of clay can have a strong influence on monopile performance. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

The ideas of bionic gradients and material mixtures are incorporated in the design to improve the damping and vibration isolation behaviors of the MGCLSPs. The compression and hysteresis responses of the empty and polyurethane foam-filled MGCLSPs are investigated experimentally and numerically. It is found that the MGCLSPs have better energy absorption characteristics than the non-gradient panels, and the MGCLSP specimen D1 which is positive gradient absorbs the most energy.

In this paper, the dynamic mechanical behaviour and energy absorption characteristics of aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels (AHSPs) under repeated impact loadings are investigated. A three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element model of AHSP under repeated impact loadings is established by using the commercial software ABAQUS Explicit. The accumulation processes of plastic deformation, the impact force-displacement curves as well as the energy absorption performances are numerically calculated. Besides, the repeated impact experiments of AHSPs were conducted by using the drop-weight impact testing machine INSTRON CEAST 9350. Furthermore, the influences of geometrical parameters on the dynamic behaviours of AHSPs under repeated impact loadings are further performed. Results show that the numerical calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental results. With the increase of the repeated impact numbers, the bending deflections of both top and bottom face sheets of AHPSs accumulate gradually, the compressive deformations of the honeycomb cores enlarge gradually and finally the densification phenomenon appears. The deformation mode of bottom face sheet experiences the mode transition from the global bending deformation model to the coupling deformation mode of the global bending deformations and the local indentations. ?? 2020",irrelevant

In addition, composite materials are subjected to complicated loading conditions, such as bending, tension, compression, and twisting. However, a significant characteristic of composite materials is their unequal compressive/tensile response. The aim of this work is to highlight the effects of laminate thickness and the type of scaling technique on the flexural response of symmetric cross-ply CFRP laminates, taking into account the unequal compressive/tensile response of these laminates. This different response has been analyzed in order to determine the failure mode exhibited by the laminates under flexural loading (flexural or interlaminar shear failure) and, additionally, where it was produced for design purposes. Three-point bending tests were carried out to determine the mechanical response in terms of strength and stiffness of the different CFRP laminates. Optical micrographs of fracture surfaces were used to assess failure mechanisms of the different configurations. It was observed that the effect of laminate thickness was significant. Thicker laminates show lower strength and strain to failure, but, conversely, higher bending stiffness. In addition, the results depict a significant change on the flexural damage performance with the stacking sequence and the type of scaling technique (sublaminate/ply-level) due to unequal compressive/tensile response. Finally, the results obtained demonstrate that introducing ply clustering had a negative effect on the [90/0] configuration, but, conversely, an improvement of the flexural damage performance on the [0/90] configuration. ?? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",irrelevant

In the literature the focus is typically on plates with a small aspect ratio and the present work deals with plates of higher aspect ratio, which are the typical ones in marine structures, aiming to determine if there is any significant effect of welding along the longitudinal direction. Nonlinear thermo-elasto-plastic finite element models are adopted to evaluate the temperature distribution, welding induced distortions and residual stress in the stiffened plates of shipbuilding steel. Given the difficulty in data acquisition of temperature-dependent properties of the material, a simplified model of the properties is proposed, based on the values at room temperature. Good agreement is observed between the measured and simulated temperatures, indicating that the current finite element approach is appropriate to simulate the welding process. The proposed simplified material model can be efficiently used in the finite element analysis of welded steel structures. It is concluded that the welding parameters have more significant influence on the structural responses than the dimension of the plate. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

However, leaf morphological plasticity and its causes in different salinity zones are incompletely understood. To understand the mechanism of plasticity, this study investigated the responses of three dominant tree species Sundri (Heritiera fomes), Gewa (Excoecaria agallocha) and Goran (Ceriops decandra) of the Sundarbans to the salinity gradients. A total of 17 leaf parameters were measured and quantified. All collected data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical tools to investigate leaf morphological plasticity. A wide range of phenotypic plasticity was observed in all leaf parameters studied among the salinity zones of the Sundarbans. One-way ANOVA and Tukey?€?s posthoc test revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) in all leaf parameters among the salinity zones and confirming that there was a high degree of phenotypic plasticity among the salinity zones of the Sundarbans. Petiole length (PL), leaf area (LA) and leaf length/petiole length (LL/PL) showed high level of plasticity among the salinity zones of the Sundarbans for each species of Sundri, Gewa and Goran. Plasticity index (PI) was developed in this study for each species studied. High level of phenotypic plasticity in these leaf traits reflects fitness of these species to different saline environments. Our results provide clear evidence that all the leaf parameters measured for three tree species viz., Sundri, Gewa and Goran effectively utilizes a plastic strategy in different salinity zones in the Sundarbans. Morphological trait plasticity could serve as powerful biological indicators to predict the shift of leaf morphology in upcoming environmental change events like sea level rise and reduction of fresh water flow from upstream. ?? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",irrelevant

Calving recently generated tsunamis of up to 50 m in amplitude endangering human beings and coastal infrastructure. Such iceberg-tsunamis (IBTs) have been investigated based on 66 unique large-scale experiments conducted in a 50 m ?? 50 m large basin at constant water depth h. The experiments involved five iceberg calving mechanisms: A: capsizing, B: gravity-dominated fall, C: buoyancy-dominated fall, D: gravity-dominated overturning and E: buoyancy-dominated overturning. The kinematics of the up to 187 kg heavy plastic blocks mimicking icebergs was measured with a motion sensor and the wave profiles were recorded with wave probes at up to 35 locations. The IBTs from the gravity-dominated mechanisms (B and D) are roughly an order of magnitude larger than from mechanisms A, C and E. Empirical equations for preliminary hazard assessment and mitigation for the maximum wave height, amplitude and period for both the near- and far-field are derived for the five calving mechanisms individually and combined. The relative released energy, Froude number and relative iceberg width are the most influential dimensionless parameters in these equations. A maximum wave height decay trend close to (r/h)???1.0 is observed, with r as the radial distance, in agreement with the theoretical wave decay from a point source. The empirical equations are applied to a past event resulting in a good agreement and the upscaled wave periods to typical Greenlandic conditions overlap with the lower spectrum of landslide-tsunamis. However, empirical equations for landslide-tsunamis were found to be of limited use to predict IBTs in the far-field supporting the need of the newly introduced empirical equations for IBT hazard assessment and mitigation. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

This study aims to investigate the durability of RC beams externally strengthened with prestressed CFRP sheet in a chloride-containing environment. The prestressed load levels were set at 7.5%, and 15% of the ultimate tensile strength of the CFRP sheet at room temperature ( 26 ??C), and the test parameters included an inclined U-jacket (or not) and 90-day exposure to a wet?€?dry cyclic environment. The wet?€?dry cyclic condition was set as 8-h immersion in 3.5% NaCl solution at 40 ??C and 16-h drying at 25 ??C and 60% RH (relative humidity). After exposure to the wet?€?dry environment, the prestressed CFRP sheet strengthened RC beams were tested under four-point bending test. The evolution of time-dependent prestress losses in the strengthened beam was discussed, and then the flexural behaviour of the strengthened beams was analyzed. Finally, a theoretical model based on the classical beam theory was proposed to predict the bearing capacity of prestressed-CFRP strengthened RC beams. The results show that the prestressed CFRP sheet can significantly improve the flexural performance of RC beams, and the cracking and ultimate loads of the RC beam strengthened with a prestressing level of 15% could increase by approximately 50% and 40%, respectively. Moreover, the inclined U-jacket enhanced the flexural performance of the strengthened RC beams and changed the failure mode from CFRP debonding to CFRP fracture. Although the exposure in chloride-containing environments increased the prestress losses, a 90-day exposure in the simulated subtropical marine climate environment did not cause a significant detrimental influence on the flexural performance of the strengthened RC beams. The proposed model agrees well with the experimental results, indicating it could conservatively predict the bearing capacity of strengthened RC beams failed by CFRP fracture. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

To further improve the mechanical properties, while maintaining the corrosion resistance of pure Al and Al alloy coatings, ceramic particles are commonly added into the Al matrix to produce particle-strengthened Al matrix composite (P-AMC) coatings. In this study, dense 7075Al composite coatings reinforced with uniformly distributed in-situ TiB2 nanoparticles (hereafter named TiB2/7075Al) were successfully produced by CS using a gas-atomized composite powder and the propulsive gases of air and helium. Following this, the corrosion behavior of the cold sprayed (CSed) TiB2/7075Al composites was investigated using Tafel polarization, electrochemical impedance, spectroscopy, and immersion tests in 0.1 M and 0.6 M NaCl solutions, and were compared to those of the CSed pure 7075Al coating and bulk 7075Al-T6 material. Electrochemical tests revealed that the composite coating exhibits a higher corrosion rate than the pure 7075Al coating, primarily caused by a galvanic coupling between TiB2 nanoparticles and the more active Al matrix. Compared to the air-processed coatings, the He-processed ones exhibit higher densities of defects, like dislocations, and precipitates due to larger plastic deformation of the sprayed particles, which result in more active sites for corrosion and thus lower corrosion resistance. Low-temperature annealing treatment (230 ??C/6 h) reduces these defects to increase the corrosion resistance of the CSed coatings. Comparatively, high-temperature annealing treatment (412 ??C/4 h) results in the coarsening of precipitates and grain growth to increase the corrosion rate of the coatings.

RFID8G2D,10.1088/1755-1315/618/1/012009,Study of Debris Movement in South and West Coast of Sumatra and Java and Its Impact on Bali Strait during Western Monsoon,"Bali Strait is one of the most unique and important water areas, especially for the coastal communities of Banyuwangi and Jembrana up to Badung Regency. The Bali Strait has Sardinella lemuru fish resources where it is widely exploited and is the main livelihood income of the coastal communities. In recent years, the quality of Sardinella lemuru fish has begun to decline due to contamination of microscopic plastic debris in the Bali Strait during western monsoon. Many previous researches have carried out the movement of debris in the Bali Strait using numerical model to find out the source and location of the marine debris, however it only carried out local simulations within the Bali Strait. This study aims to determine the movement of debris that reaches the Bali Strait assuming debris originates from coastal areas on south and west coast of Sumatra and Java during the western monsoon (December 2018 - February 2019). The Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) model is used to obtain circulation of current patterns and debris particles movement patterns using the Lagrangian Particle Tracking module. The verification result of the model current pattern and field data using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) equation. In the u velocity component the RMSE value is 0.014 m/s with a correlation of 0.968 and the v velocity component is 0.011 m/s with a correlation of 0.945. In general, the current pattern in the waters of southern of Sumatra Island to Java Island in the dominant western monsoon moves eastward due to the influence of western monsoon. The simulation results show particles that reached the Bali Strait as much as 3.47% originating only from the coastal waters of East Java. ?? Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",uncertain

A simple approach was developed using diluted acid with microwave-assisted wet digestion. The following parameters were evaluated: nitric acid concentration (0.5 to 14.4 mol L???1), digestion temperature (180 to 220 ??C), irradiation program holding time (10 to 30 min), MP particle size (0.3 to 5 mm), and the seafood mass (0.5 to 2 g). To develop a reliable method for the determination of MP amount, up to 2 g of an in natura seafood sample were spiked with a known amount of MP (100 mg of mixed MP). Suitable conditions were obtained using 1 mol L???1 HNO3 at 200 ??C (10 min holding time). Digests were filtered and the plastic content was gravimetrically determined. The heating program was 20 min, which represents a significant reduction in the time normally reported in the literature for MP analysis (from few hours up to 3 days). The proposed method allowed gravimetric determination of eight plastic types (polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, expanded polystyrene, polypropylene, high and low density polyethylene, polycarbonate and polyvinyl chloride) with particle size ???0.3 mm. Up to 2 g of an in natura seafood sample (shark species, acoupa weakfish, tuna fish, trahira, and pink shrimp) were efficiently digested, which opened the possibility of using the proposed digestion method for determining elemental contaminants (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, and Zn). Thus, as the main feature of the proposed digestion method is the possibility of determining MP and elemental contaminants using the same digestion protocol, saves time and reagents and provides accurate and precise information about different classes of marine pollutants (MP and elemental contaminants). ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

To help fill this information gap, this article represents an investigation of the effects of virgin polyvinyl chloride (v-PVC) microplastics (MPs) and UV-aged polyvinyl chloride (a-PVC) MPs on the growth and chlorophyll content of the freshwater algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) at different periods (0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h). The results suggest that both virgin and aged PVC MPs have negative effects on the growth of C. reinhardtii in the range of 10 mg/L to 200 mg/L, which leads to the reduction of chlorophyll-a level in the cells. Furthermore, a-PVC MPs were more toxic than v-PVC MPs, as shown by the a-PVC MPs' lower EC50 values after 96 h (63.66 mg/L for a-PVC MPs and 104.93 mg/L for v-PVC MPs). The inhibition effect of both kinds of PVC was also testified by the enhancement of enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in algae. Meanwhile, a-PVC MPs obviously had a higher toxicity than v-PVC MPs. The aging process that affected the surface characteristics of a-PVC was identified using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Zetasizer. The carbonyl groups formed on the surface and the increased zeta potential of the a-PVC MPs affected the interaction between the microplastics and the algae, which increased the toxicity of aged microplastics. The research results presented here provide more evidence of the risks microplastics bring into the freshwater ecosystem. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Here, we investigated, by means of microcosm studies, the role of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), the main constituents of plastic bottles, in the marine environment. To this aim, different bacterial consortia, previously acclimated to representative hydrocarbons fractions namely, tetradecane (aliphatic fraction), diesel (mixture of hydrocarbons), and naphthalene/phenantrene (aromatic fraction), were used as inocula of microcosm experiments, in order to identify peculiar specialization in poly(ethylene terephthalate) degradation. Upon formation of a mature biofilm on the surface of poly(ethylene terephthalate) films, the bacterial biodiversity and degradation efficiency of each selected consortium was analyzed. Notably, significant differences on biofilm biodiversity were observed with distinctive hydrocarbons-degraders being enriched on poly(ethylene terephthalate) surface, such as Alcanivorax, Hyphomonas, and Cycloclasticus species. Interestingly, ATR-FTIR analyses, supported by SEM and water contact angle measurements, revealed major alterations of the surface chemistry and morphology of PET films, mainly driven by the bacterial consortia enriched on tetradecane and diesel. Distinctive signatures of microbial activity were the alteration of the FTIR spectra as a consequence of PET chain scission through the hydrolysis of the ester bond, the increased sample hydrophobicity as well as the formation of small cracks and cavities on the surface of the film. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that hydrocarbons-degrading marine bacteria have the potential to degrade poly(ethylene terephthalate), although their degradative activity could potentially trigger the formation of harmful microplastics in the marine environment. ?? 2020",irrelevant

Three unmanned aerial system (UAS) flights were deployed on a beach-dune system at the Atlantic Portuguese coast to assess two main goals: (i) quantifying the morphological changes that occurred among flights, with focus on dune erosion, and (ii) mapping the changes of marine macro-litter abundance on the shore. Two most vulnerable-to-erosion sectors of the beach were identified. In the northern sector, the groin affected the downdrift shoreline, with dune erosion of about 1 m. In the central part of the beach, the dunes recessed about 4 m during the winter, being more exposed to environmental forcing due to the absence of dune vegetation. Marine litter occupation area on the beach decreased from 25% to 20% over the winter, with octopus pots (13%) and fragments (69%) being the most abundant items on average. Litter distribution varied in relation to swash elevation, wind speed and direction. With low swash elevation, the wind played a predominant role in moving the stranded items northwards, whereas high swash elevation concentrated the items at the dune foot. This study emphasizes the potential of UAS in allowing an integrated approach for coastal erosion monitoring and marine litter mapping, and set the ground for marine litter dynamic modelling on the shore. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",relevant
QJMR5UNT,10.3389/fenvs.2020.582217,Distribution Patterns of Microplastics in Seawater Surface at a Portuguese Estuary and Marine Park,"Measuring local levels of marine pollution by microplastics (MP) and identifying potential sources in coastal areas is essential to evaluate the associated impacts to environment and biota. The accumulation of floating MP at the sea surface is of great concern as the neustonic habitat consists of a feeding ground for primary consumers (including filter-feeders) and active predators, which makes these organisms a relevant via of MP input into the marine trophic chain. Here, a baseline evaluation of MP accumulation at the sea surface was conducted with a neuston net (335 ??m mesh) at the Arr??bida coastal area, in Portugal. The study site encompasses a marine protected area and an estuary, both under strong anthropogenic pressures due to multiple activities taking place. A short-term investigation on local spatiotemporal distribution, concentration and composition of MP was performed for the first time, through the monthly collection (summer 2018 to winter 2019) of samples at 6 stations. All the neuston samples contained MP and their mean concentration was 0.45 ?? 0.52 items m???3 (mean ?? SD). Both the averaged MP:neuston and MP:ichthyoplankton ratios were higher in December, when concentrations of organisms decreased. Temporal distribution patterns followed expected trends, as MP concentration was clearly higher in winter months due to precipitation and runoff. Although mean MP concentrations did not vary significantly between sampling stations, there was a spatial distribution of MP in relation to particle shape and size. Fragments were the most abundant shape and MP belonging to 1?€?2 mm size class were dominant. Amongst a diversity of 10 polymers identified by FTIR analysis, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and copolymer PP/PE were the most abundant. Potential links between local sources/activities and the different polymers were suggested. Altogether, the information provided in this study aims to raise awareness among the identified sectors and consequently to act toward the prevention of MP inputs in the region. ??

Here, we investigated the interactive effects of five oceanic environmental drivers (CO2, temperature, light, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate) on the growth rate, particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) quotas of the cosmopolitan coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi. The population growth rate increased with increasing temperature (16 to 20 ??C) and light intensities (60 to 240 ??molphotonsm-2 s-1) but decreased with elevated pCO2 concentrations (370 to 960 ??atm) and reduced availability of nitrate (24.3 to 7.8 ??molL-1) and phosphate (1.5 to 0.5 ??molL-1). POC quotas were predominantly enhanced by the combined effects of increased pCO2 and decreased availability of phosphate. PIC quotas increased with decreased availability of nitrate and phosphate. Our results show that concurrent changes in nutrient concentrations and pCO2 levels predominantly affected the growth, photosynthetic carbon fixation and calcification of E. huxleyi and imply that plastic responses to progressive ocean acidification, warming, and decreasing availability of nitrate and phosphate reduce the population growth rate while increasing cellular quotas of particulate organic and inorganic carbon of E. huxleyi, ultimately affecting coccolithophore-related ecological and biogeochemical processes. ??

24YF7L6Q,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141469,Nano- and microplastics trigger secretion of protein-rich extracellular polymeric substances from phytoplankton,"The substantial increase in plastic pollution in marine ecosystems raises concerns about its adverse impacts on the microbial community. Microorganisms (bacteria, phytoplankton) are important producers of exopolymeric substances (EPS), which govern the processes of marine organic aggregate formation, microbial colonization, and pollutant mobility. Until now, the effects of nano- and micro-plastics on characteristics of EPS composition have received little attention. This study investigated EPS secretion by four phytoplankton species following exposure to various concentrations of polystyrene nano- and microplastics (55 nm nanoparticles; 1 and 6 ??m microparticles). The 55 nm nanoparticles induced less growth/survival (determined on a DNA basis) and produced EPS with higher protein-to-carbohydrate (P/C) ratios than the exposure to microplastic particles. The amount of DNA from the four marine phytoplankton showed a higher negative linear correlation with increasing P/C ratios, especially in response to nanoplastic exposure. These results provide evidence that marine phytoplankton are quite sensitive to smaller-sized plastics and actively modify their EPS chemical composition to cope with the stress from pollution. Furthermore, the release of protein-rich EPS was found to facilitate aggregate formation and surface modification of plastic particles, thereby affecting their fate and colonization. Overall, this work offers new insights into the potential harm of different-sized plastic particles and a better understanding of the responding mechanism of marine phytoplankton for plastic pollution. The data also provide needed information about the fate of marine plastics and biogenic aggregation and scavenging processes. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

However, knowledge about plastic abundance within coral reef habitat and beach sediments surrounding remote inhabited coral islands is scarce. In this study, microplastic accumulation was investigated on a small inhabited coral island located in the Maldives. Sediments from 22 sampling sites across fore reef, reef flat, and beach environments were analysed for plastic particles <5 mm. Density separation and microscope enumeration revealed a total of 1244 individual microplastic pieces, in filamentous (49%) and fragmented (51%) forms, found across all sampling sites. High concentrations were recorded at all sites, however, there was no significant relationship between microplastic concentration or size across regions (inner atoll and outer atoll) or environments (fore reef, reef flat, and beach). Furthermore, concentrations of microplastic fragment and filament forms, total concentration, and the microplastic community, showed little correlation with sediment particle size. Our findings show microplastics are ubiquitous in marine sediments around a remote coral island, at sizes ingestible by marine organisms, raising concerns about potential effects of microplastic ingestion by coral reef species. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",relevant

Microplastic (MP) samples were collected in a one-year sampling event from the surface water of the eight main riverine outlets in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, and analyzed for OPs affiliated with MPs, including 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), eight polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The mean concentrations of MP-affiliated ??16PAH, ??8PBDE, and ??14PCB were 2010 (range: 25-40,100), 412 (range: 0.84-14,800), and 67.7 (range: 1.86-456) ng g-1, respectively.

A total of 32 sediment and 10 water samples were studied. The mean concentration of MPs was 15 units kg???1 in the sediments and 710 units m???3 in the coastal water. Fibers constituted by far the dominant MPs in both media, accounting for 97% of the MPs in both sediment and water samples. The MPs were mainly black in color. The dominant size of MP particles in sediment samples was between 250 and 500 ??m, while the fraction &gt;1000 ??m dominated in the water samples. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and nylon (NYL) were the main polymers and/or copolymers composing MPs in both sediment and water samples. The MP particles had a relatively smooth surface morphology, although signs of weathering were observed. The number of MP particles in sediment and water samples showed a general decrease from west to east in the study area. This may be reflecting the spreading of MP loading from the outlets of Sefidrud, Tonekabon, Chalus, the major rivers entering the Caspian Sea just west of the study area, and the overall decrease in the spatial distribution of touristic and fishery activity. The main sources of MP particles could be local emissions from a large number of domestic wastewater effluents and urban surface runoff due to high population density, and industrial and fishing activities in this region. This study indicated that MP particles, based on their characteristics and chemical composition, are circulated between coastal waters, and shore and sea surface sediments of the Caspian Sea, leading to their uneven distribution in the different depths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the distribution of MP particles in sea surface sediments and also the most comprehensive on MPs in shoreline sediments and coastal waters in the southern Caspian Sea. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",relevant

Then, in the second stage, 30-days growth experiments with 20 conditions were performed for the larvae settled on plastic petri dishes. The optimized devices and conditions suited for the early-stage cultivation of sponge larvae were obtained. In the final stage, a 4-months growth experiment was performed with the guidance of the optimized conditions acquired from the former stages. At the end of the experiment, the group with the highest growth rate achieved an average length of 18.44 ?? 10.73 mm, and the largest juvenile length reached 33.4 mm, equivalent to a 45-folds increase in length or over 20,000-folds increase in volume when compared to the larvae that just settled.

To provide insight into the plastic deformations of plates, this paper investigates the nonlinear elastic-plastic responses of plates impacted by an ice wedge striker and an idealized rigid striker by both experimental and numerical methods. The ice material model based on a soil and concrete material model is used in ANSYS/LS-DYNA program to simulate the ice mechanical behaviour in an ice-plate impact scenario. Good correlation is obtained between the experimental, numerical and analytical results for plastic deformations of plate and collision forces. The comparisons of elastic-plastic responses of plate under these two strikers are conducted by both model tests and numerical simulations. Besides, a series of numerical calculations are carried out to study the differences of ice-plate impact and rigid striker-plate impact. The plastic deformations and energy absorption of plate, energy dissipation of ice damage are investigated. Moreover, for these specific cases studied, an energy absorption reduction factor (EARF) of plate under ice impact compared to rigid striker impact is proposed to estimate the structural damage, which provide some useful information for the design of ship plate against ice impact. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

A comparative analysis of the bearing capacity factor between the plastic limit solutions and the results presented in previous references is performed, and the feasibility of the lower and upper bound models is verified. As the aspect ratio of the anchor tip increases, the friction factor significantly affects the bearing capacity factor: the bearing capacity factor decreases with increasing the aspect ratio for smooth interface but increases with increasing the aspect ratio for the rough interface.

However, making decisions without measuring trade-off conditions between the different scenarios may lead to higher impacts elsewhere on the life cycle or even in other areas of protection. To deepen this discussion, this paper aimed to quantify the potential environmental impacts of different drinking straws as well as find possible break-even situations. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to assess six different drinking straws (plastic, stainless steel, glass, paper, bamboo and jute) from cradle-to-grave. A hybrid life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method was applied following the characterization models recommended by ILCD. Sensitivity analyses included reuse rate, washing condition, the ancillary kits usage, End-of-Life (EoL) strategies and the inclusion of an indicator to account for the marine litter impacts from Life Cycle Inventory (LCI). Results showed that for baseline scenarios, plastic drinking straws have a better environmental performance if compared to reusable straws and has a favourable performance in 10 of 11 categories if compared to paper drinking straws. Water and detergent consumptions during the use phase and the manufacturing of additional elements (bag, brush) are the main drivers for this potentially higher environmental impact. Sensitivity analyses, however, showed that certain consumption patterns may lead to a break-even situation, especially when plastic drinking straws are disposed incorrectly into the natural ecosystem. Accounting for the impacts of marine litter may lead to a change in the decision-making depending on the significance (weight) attributed to the marine litter indicator. These outcomes reinforce the importance of understanding trade-offs during the entire life cycle of products and demonstrate that policies directed to product substitution should be carefully grounded. Recommendations on reusable straws rely on simplifying their ?€?kits?€?, expanding reuse rates and improving the washing process. For single use straws, waste collection and correct disposal are mandatory. The lack of a LCIA methodology to account for the environmental impact of mismanaged plastic waste on ecosystems, especially in the marine compartment represents an important issue to be further developed, from which, more realistic scenarios could be outlined for any product. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant

This study investigates the distribution and characteristics of plastic pellets accumulated on beaches of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America and provides a ?€?snapshot?€? of pellet distribution in a lake system that accounts for 21% of the world's freshwater reserves. We sampled pellets simultaneously from 10m2 quadrats on 66 beaches and characterized the 12,595 pellets collected (average of 19.1 pellets/m2). Forty-two beaches contained pellets and 86% of the pellets were found on three beaches: Rossport (Lake Superior), Baxter (Lake Huron), and Bronte (Lake Ontario). The number of pellets on each beach was compared with factors hypothesized to control their accumulation. In general, positive correlations were found between pellet abundance and watershed population, number of plastic-related industries, and proximity to a river mouth, although for Lake Superior, abundance was related to a train spill that took place over 10 years ago. Beach grain size appears to be related to pellet abundance, with very fine sand, fine sand and medium sand containing the greatest number of pellets. All pellets were visually characterized based on size, color, shape, weathering, and distinguishing traits. The predominant color was white, oblate shapes were most common, and the main distinguishing trait was a dimple. Most pellets showed little evidence of weathering, with the weathered samples mainly from Lakes Erie and Ontario. Lake Ontario pellets were the most varied, with 6/7 shapes, 35/40 colors, and 21/25 distinguishing traits, indicating a wider range of pellet sources compared to the other lakes. Polymer compositions were mainly polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP).

The amphiphilic copolymer (PVP-PFA-PDMS) was blended into a cross-linked PDMS matrix to form a set of controlled surface composition and surface-renewal coatings with efficient antifouling and fouling-release properties. These coatings incorporated the biofouling settlement resistance ability attributed to the hydrophilic PVP segments and the reduced adhesion strength attributed to the low surface energy of fluorine-silicon-containing segments. As expected, the coatings showed an excellent antifouling performance against bacteria and marine unicellular Navicula parva diatoms (98.1 and 98.5% of reduction, respectively) and fouling-release performance against pseudobarnacle adhesion (84.3% of reduction) compared to the pristine PDMS coating.

L7LPN5U4,10.5194/se-11-2327-2020,Impact of upper mantle convection on lithosphere hyperextension and subsequent horizontally forced subduction initiation,"Many plate tectonic processes, such as subduction initiation, are embedded in long-term (> 100 Myr) geodynamic cycles often involving subsequent phases of extension, cooling without plate deformation and convergence. However, the impact of upper mantle convection on lithosphere dynamics during such long-term cycles is still poorly understood. We have designed two-dimensional upper-mantlescale (down to a depth of 660 km) thermo-mechanical numerical models of coupled lithosphere-mantle deformation. We consider visco-elasto-plastic deformation including a combination of diffusion, dislocation and Peierls creep law mechanisms. Mantle densities are calculated from petrological phase diagrams (Perple_X) for a Hawaiian pyrolite. Our models exhibit realistic Rayleigh numbers between 106 and 107, and the model temperature, density and viscosity structures agree with geological and geophysical data and observations. We tested the impact of the viscosity structure in the asthenosphere on upper mantle convection and lithosphere dynamics.We also compare models in which mantle convection is explicitly modelled with models in which convection is parameterized by Nusselt number scaling of the mantle thermal conductivity. Further, we quantified the plate driving forces necessary for subduction initiation in 2D thermomechanical models of coupled lithosphere-mantle deformation. Our model generates a 120 Myr long geodynamic cycle of subsequent extension (30 Myr), cooling (70 Myr) and convergence (20 Myr) coupled to upper mantle convection in a single and continuous simulation. Fundamental features such as the formation of hyperextended margins, upper mantle convective flow and subduction initiation are captured by the simulations presented here. Compared to a strong asthenosphere, a weak asthenosphere leads to the following differences: smaller value of plate driving forces necessary for subduction initiation (15TNm1 instead of 22 TNm1) and locally larger suction forces. The latter assists in establishing single-slab subduction rather than double-slab subduction. Subduction initiation is horizontally forced, occurs at the transition from the exhumed mantle to the hyperextended passive margin and is caused by thermal softening. Spontaneous subduction initiation due to negative buoyancy of the 400 km wide, cooled, exhumed mantle is not observed after 100 Myr in model history. Our models indicate that long-term lithosphere dynamics can be strongly impacted by sub-lithosphere dynamics. The first-order processes in the simulated geodynamic cycle are applicable to orogenies that resulted from the opening and closure of embryonic oceans bounded by magma-poor hyperextended rifted margins, which might have been the case for the Alpine orogeny. ??

However, atmospheric input of MPs to the ocean is rarely quantified. To address this issue, transport of atmospheric MPs from source to sink was studied in the Asia-Pacific region during nine cruises from October 2018 to September 2019. Both deposited atmospheric MPs (DAMPs) and suspended atmospheric MPs (SAMPs) were collected, ranging from 23.04 n/(m2??d) to 67.54 n/(m2??d), and 0 to 1.37 n/m3, respectively. Size composition revealed that atmospheric deposition of MPs originating in terrestrial regions seems inadequate and insufficient to quantify the atmospheric input to the ocean. In addition, combined with aerodynamic modelling, for the first time, we estimated that 7.64?€?33.76 t of fibrous atmospheric MPs was globally generated in 2018, which is 3 % and 31 % of riverine input MPs of The Yangtze River and The Pearl River in terms of mid-point mass, respectively. The increasing load of ingestible plastics from sea air could have a far-reaching impact on marine ecosystem. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",uncertain
VERGRMUM,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123239,Effects of microplastics and their adsorption of cadmium as vectors on the cladoceran Moina monogolica Daday: Implications for plastic-ingesting organisms,"As pervasive and resilient contaminants, microplastics (MPs) have potential to interact with the toxicity of metals through adsorption on the surface. In this study, we focused on 7-day adsorption of cadmium (5, 10 ??g/L) to aged polyethylene-MPs particles (300 ??g/L), and further examined 21-day chronic effects of MPs and MPs-Cd on cladoceran Moina monogolica Daday. The effects criteria selected were physiological changes (e.g., parental survival time, somatic growth and reproductive parameters) and nutritional profiles in offspring. Exposure of M. monogolica to both MPs and MPs-Cd can impair the development, reproductive output and fecundity across treatment groups, ultimately leading to parental mortality and poor nutritional status in progeny. Importantly, MPs with adsorbed Cd showed greater adverse dose-dependent effects than bare MPs, likely due to the mechanisms of physico-chemical interactions related to the Cd release from MPs-Cd inside organisms. MPs can pose not only a direct harm to the organisms but also an indirect hazard via adsorption as ?€?transport vector?€?, having implications for the function and resilience of aquatic ecosystems. Our findings experimentally highlight the importance of characterizing chemical profiling of contaminants adsorbed to field plastics in order to better assess environmentally relevant risks associated with MPs and metals in coastal areas. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

This study firstly proposed to in situ quantify fluoranthene (a representative HOCs) pre-concentrated on MPs using surface enhance raman scattering (SERS) in combination with mathematical models, as an efficient monitoring tool for fluoranthene pollution in the aquatic environment. AgNPs-coated quartz (AgNPs@SiO2) substrate was fabricated. The SERS substrate was tested using fluoranthene standard solution with the minimal detectable concentration of 1 ng/mL achieved. Applying SERS for the detection of fluoranthene sorbed on MPs, the detection limit of fluoranthene on MPs was 3.3 ng/g, where the concentration in the corresponding equilibrium seawater was 0.97 ng/mL. Since more than one fluoranthene peak was observed, the quantitative detection was investigated by interval partial least square model. Eight characteristic peak ranges were selected to develop the model for predicting fluoranthene concentration, with R2c and R2v of 0.90 and 0.82, respectively. The study provides a promising solution to monitor trace level of contaminations in aquatic environment, using MPs as the passive sampler. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

This study aims to determine the acute and chronic toxicity after exposure to polystyrene microplastics in brine shrimp with various concentrations. Our results demonstrated that acute exposure to polystyrene microplastics induced no significant effects on the survival of brine shrimp. Interestingly, the concentration-dependent increase in both bioaccumulation and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed after acute and chronic exposure. Moreover, the histopathology analysis revealed the deformation of epithelial cells in the midgut region after both acute exposures at 100 mg/L and chronic exposure at 1 mg/L to polystyrene microplastics. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of microplastics-mediated toxicity, the transcriptome analysis was performed after chronic exposure, and the result showed 721 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 156 known KEGG pathways. 292 DEGs genes were significantly upregulated and 429 genes were significantly downregulated. The transcriptome analysis further revealed the DEGs related pathways.

NCDTPEHI,10.3389/fbioe.2020.562760,Evidence of Marine Microplastics in Commercially Harvested Seafood,"Microplastic pollution is a global issue that has a detrimental impact on food safety. In marine environments, microplastics are a threat to marine organisms, as they are often the same size range as prey and are mistaken as food. Consumption of microplastics has led to the damage of digestive organs and a reduction in growth and reproductive output. In this study, microplastic pollution was assessed across three commercially available shrimp species that were obtained from the supermarkets of Singapore. A total of 93 individuals were studied from the Pacific white leg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, the Argentine red shrimp Pleoticus muelleri and the Indian white shrimp Fenneropenaeus indicus. Microplastic fibers, fragments, film and spheres were identified from the digestive tract of these organisms. Microplastic abundance ranged from 13.4 to 7050 items. F. indicus exhibited the highest number of microplastics. Microplastic film was the most abundant in L. vannamei individuals (93?€?97%) and spheres were the most abundant in P. muelleri (70%) and F. indicus (61%) individuals. This study demonstrates that microplastic contamination is evident in commonly consumed shrimp and highlights the role of shrimp in the trophic transfer and accumulation of microplastics in seafood. The consumption of microplastic-containing seafood is a route of exposure to humans and has implications on human health and food security.

QM73CR29,10.1103/PhysRevFluids.5.124301,Settling of inertial nonspherical particles in wavy flow,"Microplastics are an increasingly significant problem in the world's oceans. They are transported by various ocean phenomena, one of the most fundamental of which is surface gravity waves. Since microplastics are irregularly shaped and are not typically neutrally buoyant, understanding the settling of negatively buoyant, nonspherical plastic particles under surface gravity waves is important for accurately predicting the fate of microplastics in the ocean. Here we experimentally investigate the settling of plastic rods, disks, and spheres in wavy flows. We find that the average vertical velocities of the particles can both increase and decrease in waves, relative to the particle settling velocity in quiescent flow. This variation is a function of the flow inertia at the length scale of the particle, which we characterize with a particle Reynolds number, Rep, and is also a function of particle shape. We further examine the average vertical particle velocities by looking at two factors contributing to their behavior: The relative velocities between the particles and the flow and the manner in which the particles sample the flow. We find that the average relative velocities between the particles and the flow remain constant with Rep, even though the variation of the relative velocities of the rods with orientation increases with increasing Rep. The observed variation of the average vertical particle velocities with Rep can be explained instead by how the particles sample the flow, as each of the particle shapes nonuniformly sample the flow as a function of Rep. Accounting for the variation of particle settling velocities with shape and inertia in models is necessary to improve the accuracy of predictions of the transport of microplastics in the ocean. ?? 2020 American Physical Society.",irrelevant

Microplastic have been reported to be responsible for the release and distribution of aquatic contaminants such organophosphorus esters, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalate esters. The occurrence, spatiotemporal trends, and ecological risk of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and non-phthalate plasticizers (NPPs) released from microplastic were investigated in water and fish (Sparus aurata) from five sites along the coast of Mahdia governorate (Tunisia), during April 2018-March 2019. In seawater the most abundant and frequently detected congeners were dibutyl phthalate (DBP, 0.017 mg L?€?1 and 0.055 mg L?€?1), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP, 0.075 mg L?€?1 and 0.219 mg L?€?1), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP, 0.071 mg L?€?1 and 4.594 mg L?€?1), and di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT, 0.634 mg L?€?1 and 2.424 mg L?€?1).

GKI5E4L2,10.5194/os-16-1491-2020,Model uncertainties of a storm and their influence on microplastics and sediment transport in the Baltic Sea,"Microplastics (MPs) are omnipresent in the aquatic environment where they pose a risk to ecosystem health and functioning. However, little is known about the concentration and transport patterns of this particulate contaminant. Measurement campaigns remain expensive, and assessments of regional MP distributions need to rely on a limited number of samples. Thus, the prediction of potential MP sink regions in the sea would be beneficial for a better estimation of MP concentration levels and a better sampling design. Based on a sediment transport model, this study investigates the transport of different MP model particles, polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles with simplified spherical sizes of 10 and 330 ??m, under storm conditions. A storm event was chosen because extreme wave heights cause intense sediment erosion down to depths that are otherwise unaffected; therefore, these events are critical for determining accumulation regions. The calculation of metocean parameters for such extreme weather events is subject to uncertainties. These uncertainties originate from the imperfect knowledge of the initial conditions and lateral boundary conditions for regional models, which are necessary to be able to run a numerical model. Processes, which can be resolved by the model, are limited by the model's resolution. For the processes for which the model resolution is too coarse, parameterizations are used. This leads to additional uncertainty based on the model physics. This sensitivity study targets the propagation of uncertainty from the atmospheric conditions to MP erosion and deposition, on the basis of freely available models and data. We find that atmospheric conditions have a strong impact on the quantity of eroded and deposited material. Thus, even if the settling and resuspension properties of MP were known, a quantitative transport estimation by ocean models would still show considerable uncertainty due to the imperfect knowledge of atmospheric conditions. The uncertainty in the transport depends on the particle size and density, as transport of the larger and denser plastic particles only takes place under storm conditions. Less uncertainty exists in the location of erosional and depositional areas, which seems to be mainly influenced by the bathymetry. We conclude that while quantitative model predictions of sedimentary MP concentrations in marine sediments are hampered by the uncertainty in the wind fields during storms, models can be a valuable tool to select sampling locations for sedimentary MP concentrations to support their empirical quantification. The purpose of this study is to support the strategic planning of measurement campaigns, as the model predictions can be used to identify regions with larger net deposition after a specific storm event. ?? 2020 Author(s).",uncertain

Information on both is scarce when it comes to top predators like marine mammals and the burden of microplastic. This is hampered by the limited access to free ranging marine mammals for collecting samples, as well as sample handling. The present study investigated gastrointestinal tracts and faecal samples of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) regularly occurring in the German North Sea and Baltic Sea with the aim of gaining information on the occurrence of microplastics. In total, 255 particles ???100 ??m (70 fibres, 185 fragments) were found in exemplary ten intestine and nine faecal samples.

Information on exposure has been lacking, but a growing amount of ecotoxicological hazard data is now available, allowing a hazard assessment to be conducted for nanoplastics in freshwater and marine systems. Based on a critical evaluation of published studies and the construction of probabilistic species sensitivity distributions (PSSDs), we present a comprehensive, state-of-the-art understanding of nanoplastic ecotoxicity. Different freshwater and marine datasets were constructed based on different data quality levels, and for each of the datasets, PSSDs were built for both mass- and particle number-based concentrations.

Y7VUDU4N,10.46488/NEPT.2020.v19i05.001,Tackling marine plastic pollution through source-to-sea approach and circular economy,"Marine litter and associated marine pollution are becoming a complex global environmental hazard these days. Among the different faces of marine pollution, by far the largest and probably the most dangerous part is marine plastic litter. Plastic litter can be found in almost every marine environment in the world, including deep ocean beds and frozen polar ice. Unless new sustainable methods of plastic production and waste management are encouraged, marine plastic pollution will continue to pose a severe threat to the natural ecosystems of the world. In this paper, the status of marine plastic litter is reviewed using a DPSIR framework, and it is found that significant changes in the way we live and consume are needed to prevent it. A framework that combines the source-to-sea approach and circular economy is introduced as a possible solution to eliminate plastic waste from the environment as well as from the economy. ?? 2020 Technoscience Publications.

Although most research to date has targeted microplastic pollution within the marine environment, riverine pathways deliver up to 80 % of plastic debris into the seas and oceans. The transfer mechanisms of microplastics through river systems, however, remain largely understudied. A number of authors have attempted to assess the fate of plastic particles in river systems, often reporting contrasting findings. This is mainly due to the heterogeneity of river systems combined with a lack of standardisation between the sampling protocols adopted. Here, we summarise the current state of knowledge on the riverine transport pathways of plastic debris and examine the typical spatio-temporal patterns in microplastic occurrence in river waters and sediments. Furthermore, we critically evaluate the commonly used sampling techniques and provide guidelines for unified field study design. Lastly, we identify issues that warrant further research and propose recommendations for future studies to improve our understanding of microplastics in the riverine environment. Standardisation of sampling methods will be vital for the development of a more reliable microplastic monitoring strategy and, on a longer timescale, the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures. ?? 2020",irrelevant

The results indicated that the amount of microcapsules increased during the irrigation season (9423?€?74,869 pieces/m2) and decreased in the non-irrigation season (77?€?1471 pieces/m2). Microcapsules accounted for 90% of all microplastics sampled during the irrigation season. The lack of correlation between the area of agricultural land in the watershed and the microcapsule density on the coast suggested that the density of microcapsules on the coast was not only dependent on the total load to the ocean, but also on topographic and meteorological conditions. More than 90% of the microcapsules collected from the shoreline were made of polyethylene. Scanning electron microscopic observation of the surface of the microcapsules revealed that portions of the microcapsules were removed as secondary microplastics in the process of migration to the ocean. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",uncertain
AWCKSZLA,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141115,The long-term legacy of plastic mass production,"Mismanaged plastic waste is transported via rivers or city drains into the ocean where it accumulates in coastal sediments, ocean gyres and the deep ocean. Plastic harms marine biota and may ultimately return to humans via the food chain. Private initiatives proposing to collect plastic from the sea and rivers have gained widespread attention, especially in the media. However, few of these methods are proven concepts and it remains unclear how effective they are. Here we estimate the amount of plastic in the global surface ocean to assess the long-term legacy of plastic mass production, calculate the time required to clean up the oceans with river barriers and clean up devices, and explore the fate of collected plastic waste. We find that the projected impact of both single and multiple clean up devices is very modest. A significant reduction of plastic debris in the ocean can be only achieved with collection at rivers or with a combination of river barriers and clean up devices. We also show that the incineration and production of plastic has a significant long-term effect on the global atmospheric carbon budget. We conclude that a combination of reduced plastic emissions and reinforced collection is the only way to rid the ocean of plastic waste. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Microplastics (MP), in particular, can pose risks reaching humans through the food web via various marine organisms. Among these organisms, since they are consumed as a whole, mussels are vital vectors of MP transfer during human consumption. Hence, here we analyzed MP pollution in Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) sampled from 23 different locations all along the Turkish coasts of the Black Sea, Sea of Marmara, and the Aegean Sea. After digestion of the mussels with H2O2, the micro-particles were determined under a stereomicroscope and characterized by confirming with FTIR analyses. 48% of the sampled mussels were found to have MPs. The average MP abundance was 0.69 item/mussel and 0.23 item/g fresh weight (fw) of soft tissue. Morphology was ordered as follows: fragments (67.6%)&gt; fibers (28.4%)&gt; films (4.05%). The dominant size of MPs was detected less than 0.5 mm (26.58%). 12 different polymers have been identified by FTIR and PET (32.9%), PP (28.4%), and PE (19.4%) were found to constitute 80% of the total MPs. The annual average exposure amount for mussel consumers in Turkey was estimated as 1918 MPs item/per year. Even though international organizations such as FAO, JECFA, or EU have not declared permissible limits, our data may inform human health uptake of MP ingestion via mussels. This data might also serve as a reference data-set for further MP monitoring research in Turkish and European Seas. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant
DSHWZGS8,10.1038/s41598-020-79304-z,Currently monitored microplastics pose negligible ecological risk to the global ocean,"Given the rise in plastic production, microplastics (MP) dominate marine debris, and their impact on marine ecosystems will likely increase. However a global quantitative assessment of this risk is still lacking. We conducted an ecological risk assessment of MP in the global ocean by comparing the thresholds of biological effects with the probability of exposure to those concentrations, according to plastic density data adjusted to a log-normal distribution. Levels of MP from 100 to 5000 ??m span from < 0.0001 to 1.89 mg/L, whereas the most conservative safe concentration is 13.8 mg/L, and probability of exposure is p = 0.00004. Therefore large MP pose negligible global risk. However, MP bioavailability, translocation and toxicity increase as size decreases, and particles < 10 ??m are not identified by current monitoring methods. Future research should target the lowest size fractions of MP and nanoplastics, and use in toxicity testing environmental plastic particles rather than engineered materials. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",uncertain

World Health Organization (WHO) has already updated the guidelines and advised the use of face masks in public areas essentially. This has dramatically increased the production and use of face masks in many parts of the world. Arabian Peninsula is comprised of six countries where the public perception of following WHO guidelines is high. In this study, we highlight the concerns relating to extensive use of face masks in this region, particularly in the context of (micro-)plastic pollution. We computed the number of face masks to be used in each of the countries of Arabian Peninsula for varying levels of acceptance rate and average number of daily usages. Accordingly, the amount of (micro-)plastic that could come into the terrestrial and marine environment is also reported. Saudi Arabia, being the most populated country in the region may contribute up to 32?€?235 thousand tons of (micro-)plastic which is nearly half of the amount in the whole Peninsula. On the other hand, an extremely high infection rate in Qatar (25.74%) may also lead to a significant increase of (micro-)plastic content due to high public acceptance rate and living standards. The high (micro-)plastic fraction is of significant concern because it ends up in the marine ecosystems. Further, it allows colonization of several pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungal filaments, and spores) and might serve as carriers of disease transmission finally affecting the living organisms habituating these ecosystems. It is suggested that appropriate regulations on face masks waste should be devised to avoid any unwanted consequences in the near future. ?? 2020 The Authors",irrelevant

In particular, how many descriptors would be necessary to model the degradation behavior of ocean plastics or understand if degradation is possible? Here, we report a data-driven approach to elucidate degradation trends of plastic debris by linking abiotic and biotic degradation behavior in seawater with physical properties and molecular structures. The results reveal a hierarchy of predictors to quantify surface erosion as well as combinations of features, like glass transition temperature and hydrophobicity, to classify ocean plastics into fast, medium, and slow degradation categories. Furthermore, to account for weathering and environmental factors, two equations model the influence of seawater temperature and mechanical forces. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",irrelevant

Here, we present global simulations of atmospheric transport of microplastic particles produced by road traffic (TWPs ?€? tire wear particles and BWPs ?€? brake wear particles), a major source that can be quantified relatively well. We find a high transport efficiencies of these particles to remote regions. About 34% of the emitted coarse TWPs and 30% of the emitted coarse BWPs (100 kt yr???1 and 40 kt yr???1 respectively) were deposited in the World Ocean. These amounts are of similar magnitude as the total estimated direct and riverine transport of TWPs and fibres to the ocean (64 kt yr???1). We suggest that the Arctic may be a particularly sensitive receptor region, where the light-absorbing properties of TWPs and BWPs may also cause accelerated warming and melting of the cryosphere. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",irrelevant

The microplastic size which was of highest concentration in Aplocheilus sp. was relatively small, ranging from 300 to 500 ??m. This small size indicates that the fish has difficulty in distinguishing between their food and the microplastics. Further, there was a possibility of the absorption of other pollutants by the plastics. Therefore, an in-depth study on the effects of plastic ingestion on aquatic life, biomagnification, exposure, chemical toxicity, and socio-economy is recommended. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",uncertain

MPs are distributed throughout the water column, dependent mainly on the density that is given by the polymer type, as well as the location, depth, and velocities of the water flows. This situation allows all aquatic organisms to be exposed to MPs. Furthermore, toxic substances can adhere to the MPs, making the consumption of fish with MPs a risk to human health. The aim of this study was to evaluate and characterize the microplastics present in the gastrointestinal tract of six species of fish which had the highest human consumption in Campeche, Mexico and their relationship with the density of MPs founded. A total of 316 microplastic particles from 240 individuals were found with 1.31 ?? 2.59 of microplastics per fish. The results indicate that there are differences (KW?€?H = 53.14) between the densities of the MPs present in demersal fish (1.41 ?? 0.4 g cm???3) with respect to the pelagic species (1.04 ?? 0.24 g cm???3). Likewise, differences were found between fibers, fragments, and pellets present in the studied fish with a pelagic: demersal ratio of 1: 2.4 for all microplastics. The demersal species Haemulon plumierii (n = 40) presented the highest number of MPs with 115 items in total, 73 fibers, and 42 fragments.

In this study, an artificial intelligence tool was used to create an image classifier based on a convolutional neural network architecture that utilises the bottleneck method. The trained bottleneck method classifier was able to categorise plastics encountered either at the shoreline or floating at the sea surface into eight distinct classes, namely, plastic bags, bottles, buckets, food wrappings, straws, derelict nets, fish, and other objects. Discerning objects with a success rate of 90%, the proposed deep learning approach constitutes a leap towards the smart identification of plastics at the coastline and the sea. Training and testing loss and accuracy results for a range of epochs and batch sizes have lent credibility to the proposed method. Results originating from a resolution sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the prediction technique retains its ability to correctly identify plastics even when image resolution was downsized by 75%.

The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the existence of microplastic pollution on three beaches on the coast of Granada (Spain), namely La Herradura, Motril Beach and La R??bita, characterizing the particles and the relationships in their distribution. This may contribute supporting the studies carried out at a national level in accordance with the Directive on Marine Strategy (2008/56/EC). The results showed a greater median concentration of particles/kg of dry sediment in La Herradura (45.0 ?? 24.7) than in Motril (31.5 ?? 21.5) and La R??bita (22.0 ?? 23.2). These data revealed a higher contamination by microplastics in an enclosed bay-type beach (La Herradura) in comparison with open delta-type beaches. The predominant morphologies were microspheres and fragments, with maximum median concentrations of 38.0 ?? 23.7 and 6.0 ?? 0.7 particles/kg, respectively. The distribution and size of the particles is affected by the geomorphological and sedimentary characteristics of these beaches, which are different from any other in Spain and in the Mediterranean in general. The beaches of Granada showed more microplastic contamination than Greek or Slovenian beaches, but less than other Spanish beaches. In this area of the Mediterranean, the presence of microplastics can be affected by the wind, sea currents or methodological aspects such as the pore size of the filters used. All of these factors were analysed when comparing the beaches of Granada with other Mediterranean beaches. This study shows that there is contamination by microplastics on the beaches of Granada, which have been little explored until now due to the difficult geological and granulometric characteristics, and gives support to other national studies. ?? 2020",relevant

The impacts of microplastics on sedimentary microbial ecosystems and biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles, however, have not been well reported. To evaluate if microplastics influence the composition and function of sedimentary microbial communities, we conducted a microcosm experiment using salt marsh sediment amended with polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane foam (PUF) or polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics. We report that the presence of microplastics alters sediment microbial community composition and nitrogen cycling processes. Compared to control sediments without microplastic, PUF- and PLA-amended sediments promote nitrification and denitrification, while PVC amendment inhibits both processes. These results indicate that nitrogen cycling processes in sediments can be significantly affected by different microplastics, which may serve as organic carbon substrates for microbial communities.

Concern about the impact of microplastics on the ecological environment, as well as the threat of microplastics to food safety and public health is increasing among the society. However, there is currently no effective technical way to tackle and remove microplastics from the environment. Thus, public attitudes are key to reducing microplastic emissions. This study investigated the public's perceptions and attitudes towards microplastics in Shanghai and used an ordered regression model to explore the public's willingness to reduce microplastics and its influencing factors. We used random face-to-face interviews to complete a total of 437 valid questionnaires. The survey results show that only 26% of the respondents had heard of microplastics before the survey, and the majority were relatively unfamiliar with microplastics. Although the public's awareness of microplastics is low compared to that of other substances, when informed with the possibility that microplastics may affect human health, 75% of respondents became worried or even overly worried. In addition, the higher the respondents' knowledge of plastics and microplastics is, the stronger their willingness to behave. Public's concern is also an important impact factor. We found that women's willingness to reduce emissions is higher than men's and environmental protection-related practitioners are also more willing to act. Therefore, this article focuses on the public's understanding of microplastics to propose measures and policy implications to reduce microplastic emissions during the process of microplastic production and recycling. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",irrelevant

Currently, intensified research is devoted to the abiotic and microbial degradation of plastic floating near the ocean surface for an extended period of time. In contrast, the impacts of environmental conditions in the deep sea on polymer properties and rigidity are virtually unknown. Here, we present unique results of plastic items identified to have been introduced into deep-sea sediments at a water depth of 4150 m in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean more than two decades ago. The results, including optical, spectroscopic, physical and microbial analyses, clearly demonstrate that the bulk polymer materials show no apparent sign of physical or chemical degradation. Solely the polymer surface layers showed reduced hydrophobicity, presumably caused by microbial colonization. The bacterial community present on the plastic items differed significantly (p < 0.1%) from those of the adjacent natural environment by a dominant presence of groups requiring steep redox gradients (Mesorhizobium, Sulfurimonas) and a remarkable decrease in diversity. The establishment of chemical gradients across the polymer surfaces presumably caused these conditions. Our findings suggest that plastic is stable over extended times under deep-sea conditions and that prolonged deposition of polymer items at the seafloor may induce local oxygen depletion at the sediment-water interface. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",uncertain

Uptake of microplastics can impair nutrition and affect the performance of organisms. However, the vulnerability to microplastics seems to vary between species for yet widely unexplored reasons. We investigated the stomach content of the brown shrimp, Crangon crangon, from the southern North Sea and performed feeding experiments and anatomical studies of the digestive organs to comprehend the distribution of fluorescent microparticles within the shrimp. Shrimp collected in their natural environment contained between 51 and more than 3,000 sand grains and fragments of bivalve shells in their stomachs. Sand grains may have been ingested to exploit the associated biofilm or to support maceration of food. Bivalve shell fragments were particularly abundant in summer when shrimp fed on freshly settled mussels. Shrimps?€? stomach can be cleaned from ingested particles by regurgitation. In an experimental approach, we administered fluorescent microbeads of 0.1, 2.1, and 9.9 ??m diameter. Only the smallest particles (0.1 ??m) entered the midgut gland, which is the principal site of nutrient resorption in crustaceans. A fine-meshed chitinous filter system in the stomach of the shrimp prevents the passage of particles larger than about 1 ??m. C. crangon appears well adapted to handle natural microscopic particles. This trait might also be advantageous in coping with microplastic pollution. ?? 2020 The Authors",irrelevant

Although case studies have increased globally, sampling campaigns are often restricted geographically, with poor spatial resolution. Here, we use citizen science to increase our geographical reach, which improved our understanding of microplastic distribution in estuarine and beach sediment along the south-west coast of England. Hotspots (>700 particles per kg dry sediment) were identified on the Scilly Islands and in close proximity to major metropolitan hubs (i.e. Falmouth and Plymouth). Particles extracted from the Scilly Island sites were composed of polyethylene and polypropylene. With low population density on the Isle of Scilly, hotspots may suggest that microplastics originate from distant sources, while Falmouth and Plymouth, on mainland UK, are locally supplied. This information supports the design of future campaigns and targeted mitigation strategies in areas of highest concentrations. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",relevant

However, due to its shown preference for plastic substrate, it could become a vector of another urgent threat, that is plastic pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",irrelevant
W7TSZ4SJ,10.3390/app10238707,Polymer type identification of marine plastic litter using a miniature near-infrared spectrometer (Micronir),"Plastic pollution in the marine environment has turned into an important research topic in recent decades. Until recently, studies were often based on visual assessment only, which is not enough to draw any conclusion about the chemical nature of found plastic items and could lead to incorrect results. Standardized, fast, and efficient low-cost methods for marine plastic litter identification are urgently needed to monitor the occurrence and distribution worldwide. In this paper, we demonstrate that a miniaturized handheld near-infrared spectrometer?€?MicroNIR?€?can be used for on-site identification of different plastic polymers. A database containing polymer spectra of the most produced and reported polymer types in the marine environment was created including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC), polyurethane (PUR), and Silicone. Using spectral match value (SMV, included in the instrument software) for spectra analysis resulted in an accurate classification of all nine polymer types. The method was used for the identification of marine macro-, meso-, and microplastic litter collected on beaches in sediments and seawater and enabled the correct identification of marine plastic litter for macro-, meso-(96%), and microplastics (73%) with exception of totally black items and items less than 1 mm in size. The method and instrumentation presented here are very well suited to support ?€?Citizen Science?€? marine litter monitoring projects during beach cleaning and similar activities. ?? 2020 by the authors.

These include direct interaction such as fisheries bycatch or indirect interaction like warming oceans and plastic ingestion. Area-based management tools (ABMTs), such as marine protected areas and time-area closures, are a widely accepted and a broadly successful form of management used to mitigate localized human impacts on marine species and ecosystems. Protection provides an opportunity for population recovery, which can then propagate outside of the closure. As the United Nations negotiates a new treaty on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction, efforts to design and implement high seas ABMTs at appropriate scales are critical to ensure that these spatial protection measures are most effective and climate-ready in the face of changing oceans. Here we identify the four most important temporal scales ?€? contemporary, intra-annual, multi-annual and multidecadal ?€? for aligning high seas ABMTs to relevant ecological, oceanographic and atmospheric processes. From this, we explore how managers and decision-makers can integrate this knowledge when implementing a new treaty. ?? 2020 The Authors",

6QBQFP27,10.1038/s41598-020-60630-1,Uptake routes of microplastics in fishes: practical and theoretical approaches to test existing theories,"Microplastics are frequently detected in the gastrointestinal tracts of aquatic organisms worldwide. A number of active and passive pathways have been suggested for fish, including the confusion of microplastic particles with prey, accidental uptake while foraging and transfer through the food chain, but a holistic understanding of influencing factors is still lacking. The aim of the study was to investigate frequently suggested theories and identify relevant biotic factors, as well as certain plastic properties, affecting microplastic intake in fish. Four species of freshwater fish, each representing a different combination of foraging style (visual/chemosensory) and domestic status (wild/farmed) were exposed to different realistic plastic concentrations and polymer types with and without the provision of genuine food. As most previous investigations of microplastic uptake routes consider only particles large enough to be perceptible to fish, the potential for accidental intake via drinking water has been somewhat neglected. This route is evaluated in the current study using a model approach. The results show that visually oriented fish forage actively on microplastic particles that optically resemble their usual food, while fish with a predominantly chemosensory foraging style are more able to discriminate inedible food items. Even so, the accidental uptake of microplastics while foraging is shown to be relevant pathway, occurring frequently in both visual and chemosensory foragers alike. Several factors were shown to increase plastic uptake, including microplastic concentration in the water, foraging behaviour promoted by availability of genuine food, and fish size. Although both wild and farmed fish ingested microplastic particles, cultured fish showed less discernment in terms of colour and were more likely to forage actively on microplastics when no food was available. Drinking has been identified as a possible source of microplastic intake specifically for large marine fish species. Particles smaller than <5 ??m can pass the gastrointestinal tract wall and bioaccumulation could arise when uptake exceeds release or when particles are assimilated in tissues or organs. The effects of accumulation may be significant, especially in long-living species, with implications for food web transfer and fish as food items. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

In the microcosm, polyurethane foams, cellulose acetate cigarette filters, and compostable polyester and polylactic acid items readily sank, whereas polyethylene air pouches, latex balloons, polystyrene foams and polypropylene cups remained afloat. Microbial biofilms dominated by Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes and Bacteriodetes grew on the plastics, and caused some of the polyethylene items to sink to the bottom. Electrical resistances (ER) of plastic items decreased as function of time, an indication that seawater had penetrated into microscopic crevices in the plastic that had developed over time. Rate constants for ER decrease in polyethylene items in the microcosm were similar to tensile elongation decrease of polyethylene sheets floating in sea, measured previously by others. Weight loss of plastic items was ??? 1% per year for polyethylene, polystyrene and polypropylene, 3?€?5% for latex, polyethylene terephthalate and polyurethane, 15% for cellulose acetate, and 7?€?27% for polyester and polylactic acid compostable bags.

4NUX4IWS,10.1038/s41598-020-58765-2,Storm Response of Fluvial Sedimentary Microplastics,"Up to 80% of the plastics in the oceans are believed to have been transferred from river networks. Microplastic contamination of river sediments has been found to be pervasive at the global scale and responsive to periods of flooding. However, the physical controls governing the storage, remobilization and pathways of transfer in fluvial sediments are unknown. This means it is not currently possible to determine the risks posed by microplastics retained within the world?€?s river systems. This problem will be further exacerbated in the future given projected changes to global flood risk and an increased likelihood of fluvial flooding. Using controlled flume experiments we show that the evolution of the sediment bed surface and the flood wave characteristics controls the transition from rivers being ?€?sinks?€? to ?€?sources?€? of microplastics under flood conditions. By linking bed surface evolution with microplastic transport characteristics we show that similarities exist between granular transport phenomena and the behavior, and hence predictability, of microplastic entrainment during floods. Our findings are significant as they suggest that microplastic release from sediment beds can be managed by altering the timing and magnitude of releases in flow managed systems. As such it may be possible to remediate or remove legacy microplastics in future. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

In addition, microplastics disturb the formation of coral-algae symbiotic relationships in primary polyps. In our experiments, we observed this effect in the bleached primary polyp Seriatopora caliendrum that lost its symbiont Symbiodiniaceae as a result of high water temperature. There was a higher incorporation of microspheres into bleached corals than in healthy ones. To understand the interference in symbiosis, we used the sea anemone Exaiptasia (as an anthozoan model organism) and fed it with microspheres. TEM results suggested the incorporation of microspheres and symbionts from the same phagocytosis zones in the mesenterial filament and endocytosis by the cells. In the tentacles, microspheres were in the same cell layer as the symbionts. These results suggest that microplastics occupy the spaces inhabited by Symbiodiniaceae, thereby hindering their symbiotic association. ?? 2020",

The new findings unraveled new environmental impacts of microplastics in natural water. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Microplastics are ubiquitous in natural waters and affect the environmental fate of hydrophobic organic micropollutants. This study evaluated the impacts of four microplastics, polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), on the photodegradation of organotin compounds (OTCs) under UV365 irradiation (2.3 ?? 0.1 W m???2). The experiments were performed by mixing PP, PE, PS or PMMA microparticles with tri-organotins in artificial seawater. The photodegradation of OTCs in microplastic suspensions was influenced by the absorptivity onto microplastics. The decomposition rate of tributyltin (TBT) in UV-irradiated PP suspensions was greater than trimethyltin (TMT) and triphenyltin (TPhT) (p &lt; 0.01). The adsorption capacities of OTCs (e.g., TBT) on PP particle surfaces were significantly lower than those on PE surfaces (p &lt; 0.05) but similar with those on PMMA due to the different surface areas, shapes, and surface hydrophobicity of microplastics. TBT degraded faster (9.1%) in PS than in PMMA suspension (11.2%) within 240 min, respectively. However, only less than 5.4% was photodegraded in PP suspension due to the light scattering or absorption of the large sized PP particles.

Pollution from land-based sources exemplifies this issue where plastic, agricultural run-off, discharge of nutrients and pesticides and untreated sewage accounts for approximately 80% of all marine pollution globally and is not adequately addressed by international law. This paper examines the following question: What role have international freshwater and marine regimes and courts played in clarifying the normative content of the due diligence rule to avoid significant transboundary environmental harm, including harm from land-based sources of pollution? The discussion demonstrates that although international regimes have made a substantial contribution to clarifying the no-harm rule, significant gaps remain. For example, the need for further guidance regarding the obligation to take ?€?all appropriate measures?€? to avoid transboundary harm or the previous absence of due diligence standards to prevent marine pollution from land-based sources. This paper demonstrates how courts have contributed to a coherent interpretation of the no-harm rule across international freshwater and oceans law. It pinpoints instances where courts have taken a progressive approach, taking account of the latest developments in technology, assessing an acceptable level of risk, considering the interconnected ecosystem impacts of developments and quantifying compensation for environmental harm and also identifies examples where courts have not gone far enough. Finally, this paper discusses how regional seas regimes and recent global soft law developments have taken progressive steps towards addressing harm from land-based sources of pollution. ?? 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",

Our results further reveal a positive correlation between the amount of plastic debris at the sea surface and the depth-integrated concentrations of plastic fragments in the water column. We therefore conclude that the presence of plastics in the water column below the NPGP is the result of ?€?fallout?€? of small plastic fragments from its surface waters. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",
DK9WSWNL,10.1186/s12302-020-00358-x,Microplastic analysis using chemical extraction followed by LC-UV analysis: a straightforward approach to determine PET content in environmental samples,"Background: The ubiquitous occurrence of microplastic particles in marine and aquatic ecosystems was intensively investigated in the past decade. However, we know less about the presence, fate, and input paths of microplastic in terrestrial ecosystems. A possible entry path for microplastic into terrestrial ecosystems is the agricultural application of sewage sludge and solid bio-waste as fertilizers. Microplastic contained in sewage sludge also includes polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which could originate as fiber from textile products or as a fragment from packaging products (foils, bottles, etc.). Information about microplastic content in such environmental samples is limited yet, as most of the used analytical methods are very time-consuming, regarding sample preparation and detection, require sophisticated analytical tools and eventually need high user knowledge. Results: Here, we present a simple, specific tool for the analysis of PET microplastic particles based on alkaline extraction of PET from the environmental matrix and subsequent determination of the monomers, terephthalic acid, using liquid chromatography with UV detection (LC-UV). The applicability of the method is shown for different types of PET in several soil-related, terrestrial environmental samples, e.g., soil, sediment, compost, fermentation residues, but also sewage sludge, suspended particles from urban water management systems, and indoor dust. Recoveries for model samples are between 94.5 and 107.1%. Limit of determination and limit of quantification are absolute masses of 0.031 and 0.121 mg PET, respectively. In order to verify the measured mass contents of the environmental samples, a method comparison with thermal extraction-desorption-gas chromatography?€?mass spectrometry (TED-GC/MS) was conducted. Both methods deliver similar results and corroborated each other. PET mass contents in environmental samples range from values below LOQ in agriculture soil up to 57,000 mg kg???1 in dust samples. Conclusions: We demonstrate the potential of an integral method based on chemical extraction for the determination of PET mass contents in solid environmental samples. The method was successfully applied to various matrices and may serve as an analytical tool for further investigations of PET-based microplastic in terrestrial ecosystems. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",
HVDHU6R5,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127649,Improving the efficiency of post-digestion method in extracting microplastics from gastrointestinal tract and gills of fish,"Post-digestion treatment is an important step during sample preparation to facilitate the removal of undigested materials for better detection of ingested microplastics. Sieving, density separation with zinc chloride solution (ZnCl2), and oil extraction protocol (OEP) have been introduced in separating microplastics from sediments. The clean-up methods are rarely highlighted in previous studies, especially in the separation of microplastics from marine biota. Thus, this study proposed and compared the suitability of three techniques, which can reduce the number of undigested particles from the digestate of GIT and gills. Our result has shown excellent removal of non-plastics materials and reduces the coloration of filter paper in all treated samples. Both sieving and density separation achieved optimum post-digestion efficiencies of &gt;95% for both GIT and gill samples, which former showed no effect on polymer integrity. Additionally, high recovery rate was obtained for the larger size microplastics (&gt;500 ??m) with approximately 97.7% (GIT) and 95.7% (gill), respectively. Exposure to the ZnCl2 solution led to a significant loss of smaller size PET and changed the absorption spectrums of all tested polymers. Particle morphology determined by SEM revealed such exposure eroded the surface of PET fragments and elemental analysis has shown detectable peaks of zinc and chlorine appeared. Low microplastics recoveries were achieved through OPE and residue of oil was observed from the infrared spectrum of all tested polymer. The findings demonstrate sieving with size fractioning can provide exceptional removal of non-plastics materials from the digestate of GIT and gill samples. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Here, we isolated three novel planctomycetal strains from a kelp forest on the California Coastline at Monterey Bay or from plastic surfaces submerged in the Baltic Sea and the estuary of the river Warnow in the northeast of Germany. According to our phylogenetic analysis, the isolated strains Poly21T, Pla100T and CA85T represent three novel species within the genus Rhodopirellula. All three show typical planctomycetal traits such as division by budding. All are aerobic, mesophilic chemoheterotrophs and show genomic features comparable to other described Rhodopirellula species. However, strain CA85T is exceptional as it forms cream colonies, but no aggregates, which is a notable deviation from the pink- to red-pigmented and aggregate-forming Rhodopirellula species known thus far.

62PRF7DB,10.1007/s11356-020-10573-x,Effects of microplastics and nanoplastics on marine environment and human health,"Microplastics (MPs) with an average size of less than 5 mm, along with nanoplastics (NPs) of an average size of fewer than 0.1 ??m are the result of huge plastic waste fragmentation or straight environmental emissions. Pollution from micro- and nanoplastics is a worldwide paradigm that raises environmental and human health concerns. They may also comprise very harmful chemicals that are implemented in plants and animals when MPs/NPs are used that may lead to higher accumulation of these compounds in food chains. In addition, higher surface area-to-volume ratio, characteristic of MPs/NPs can contribute to their potentially harmful impact as other pollutants, like continuous organic contaminants, can also be bio-accumulated and adsorbed. A complex issue correlated with MPs/NPs is their ability to absorb and interact with other common pollutants in the environment, such as metals, pharmaceuticals, and other contaminants. Thus, MPs/NPs can directly influence on destiny and toxicity of these substances to the environment and organisms. In this review, first, we introduce possible sources and formation, their destinies, and environmental impact of MPs/NPs and then explain feasible paths of all these particles entering the human body. Then, the review highlights the effect of MPs/NPs on human health. Finally, it provides a brief summary of the potential as well as the neurological toxicity of MPs/NPs. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

Recent studies implemented DNA metabarcoding to characterize the taxonomic composition of the plastisphere in different areas of the world. In this study, we used a modified metabarcoding approach which was based on longer barcode sequences for the characterization of the plastisphere biota. We compared the microbiome of polyethylene food bags after 1 month at sea to the free-living biome in two proximal but environmentally different locations on the Mediterranean coast of Israel. We targeted the full 1.5 kb-long 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and 0.4?€?0.8 kb-long regions within the 18S rRNA, ITS, tufA and COI loci for eukaryotes. The taxonomic barcodes were sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technology with multiplexing on a single MinION flow cell. We identified between 1249 and 2141 species in each of the plastic samples, of which 61 species (34 bacteria and 27 eukaryotes) were categorized as plastic-specific, including species that belong to known hydrocarbon-degrading genera. In addition to a large prokaryotes repertoire, our results, supported by scanning electron microscopy, depict a surprisingly high biodiversity of eukaryotes within the plastisphere with a dominant presence of diatoms as well as other protists, algae and fungi. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

The majority of analyzed microfibers were of natural origin. ?? 2020 The Author(s) Microfibers are reported as the most abundant microparticle type in the environment. Their small size and light weight allow easy and fast distribution, but also make it challenging to determine their chemical composition. Vibrational microspectroscopy methods as infrared and spontaneous Raman microscopy have been widely used for the identification of environmental microparticles. However, only few studies report on the identification of microfibers, mainly due to difficulties caused by their small diameter. Here we present the use of Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) microscopy for fast and reliable classification of microfibers from environmental samples. SRS microscopy features high sensitivity and has the potential to be faster than other vibrational microspectroscopy methods. As a proof of principle, we analyzed fibers extracted from the fish gastrointestinal (GIT) tract, deep-sea and coastal sediments, surface seawater and drinking water. Challenges were faced while measuring fibers from the fish GIT, due to the acidic degradation they undergo. However, the main vibrational peaks were still recognizable and sufficient to determine the natural or synthetic origin of the fibers. Notably, our results are in accordance to other recent studies showing that the majority of the analyzed environmental fibers has a natural origin. Our findings suggest that advanced spectroscopic methods must be used for estimation of the plastic fibers concentration in the environment. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",

A dye-based procedure was used to screen poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)-producing marine bacteria isolated from the Red Sea, Saudi Arabia. Among the 56 bacterial isolates, Pseudodonghicola xiamenensis, identified using 16S rRNA gene analyses, accumulated the highest amount of PHB. The highest PHB production by P. xiamenensis was achieved after 96 h of incubation at pH 7.5 and 35 ??C in the presence of 4% NaCl, and peptone was the preferred nitrogen source. The use of date syrup at 4% (w/v) resulted in a PHB concentration of 15.54 g/L and a PHB yield of 38.85% of the date syrup, with a productivity rate of 0.162 g/L/h, which could substantially improve the production cost. Structural assessment of the bioplastic by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed the presence of methyl, hydroxyl, methine, methylene, and ester carbonyl groups in the extracted polymer. The derivative products of butanoic acid estimated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry [butanoic acid, 2-amino-4-(methylseleno), hexanoic acid, 4-methyl-, methyl ester, and hexanedioic acid, monomethyl ester] confirmed the structure of PHB. The present results are the first report on the production of a bioplastic by P. xiamenensis, suggesting that Red Sea habitats are a potential biological reservoir for novel bioplastic-producing bacteria. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

The ingestion of MPs might affect the accumulation of DBP in marine organisms. In this study, the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus was applied to study the combined effect of DBP and polystyrene microplastics (mPS) on the copepod through both acute mortality tests and chronic reproduction tests. The LC50 of DBP was 1.23 mg L???1 (95% CI: 1.11?€?1.35 mg L???1), while exposure to mPS didn't have significant lethal effect on the copepods. Adsorption to MPs led to decreased bioavailability of DBP, resulting in decreased toxicity of DBP. In contrast to the results of acute toxicity tests, DBP didn't affect the reproduction of the copepods at lower exposure concentrations, while mPS reduced the number of nauplii and extended the time to hatch. Similar as acute toxicity tests, antagonistic interaction was observed for mPS and DBP in chronic reproduction tests, which might be attributed to promoted aggregation of mPS at presence of DBP. Overall, antagonistic toxicity effect between the two pollutants was observed for both acute and chronic tests, but the mechanisms of the interaction between DBP and mPS were different. Results of the present study highlighted the importance of long-term exposure when evaluating the toxic effect of MPs and their combined effect with other chemicals. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The first invading microbes on plastics in 4 different aquatic communities including seawater, freshwater, marine sediments and lake sediments were developed in microcosm incubation experiments. A mixture of weathered plastics (PE, PS, PET) was incubated with different indigenous communities under their respective habitat simulations. All microbial communities were able to form populations on all plastic surfaces with time-dependent development. Biofilm also affected floatation of plastics and the communities on PE foam (PF) were dominated by genera affiliated with plastic and hydrocarbon degraders. The results showed that indigenous populations were able to degrade plastic pieces and utilize them as carbon sources where the weight of PF was reduced more effectively than PS and PET. Besides, carbonyl groups that were seen with FTIR on initial PF disappeared after microbial treatment along with signs of bioerosion on the plastic surface. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Fibers accounted for 94.9%, 89.9% and 77.5% of the total number of MPs, respectively. The MP removal efficiency was 96.7%. MP shape (fiber, particle), size and structure were the most important factors determining their removal in different steps of the wastewater treatment process. The structure of microfibers (polyester, acrylic and nylon) and the consequent higher density than water explained their high removal (72.3%) in the primary settling tank. However, size was more important in microparticle removal with particles ???500 ??m being removed in the primary settling tank and &lt;500 ??m in the clarifier unit.

Here, we investigated the effects of polyethylene (PE) and polyamide-nylon 6 (PA 6) microplastics on ecotoxicity and DMS/DMSP production in the copepod Tigriopus japonicus. The microplastics had detrimental effects on feeding, egestion, reproduction, survival, and DMS and DMSP production in T. japonicus and presented significant dose-response relationships.

In comparison, the body size of the copepods was not significantly affected by the microplastics during one generation of culture. Ingesting fluorescently labeled microplastics confirmed that microplastics were ingested by T. japonicus and adhered to the organs of the body surface. T. japonicus grazing promoted DMS release originating from degradation of DMSP in algal cells. Grazing-activated DMS production decreased because of reduced IR in the presence of microplastics.

To minimize depredation of sea turtle nests, several protective strategies have been trialed against different predators. However, although information on their effectiveness exists, information on the effectiveness of strategies aiming to mitigate depredation by coyotes, which is an issue at loggerhead turtle, Caretta caretta, nesting beaches in Florida and globally is inexistent. To inform future management of sea turtle nest depredation by coyotes, this study evaluated the effectiveness of three nest protection strategies (self-releasing metal cage, self-releasing plastic cage, and self-releasing metal screen). Further, to obtain insights into coyote behavior during depredation activities and inform management strategies, we used infrared camera surveillance to monitor sea turtle nests. Self-releasing plastic cages were found to be the most effective strategy at mitigating coyote depredation on loggerhead nests.

The growth of bacterial isolates on the MPs surface and surrounding water was also investigated. The type of the MPs and the interaction between the mesh size and the type of the MPs showed significant differences (p &lt; 0.05). Fibers were found to be the most abundant particle type constituting 45% and 80% of the total MPs found in 330-??m and 100-??m mesh sizes, respectively. In total the observed MP abundance in the dam lake was 5.25 particles m???3, and 4.09 particles m???3 was observed for 100-??m and 330-??m mesh sizes, respectively. The color of the identified microplastics showed variations among microplastic types; however, the dominant color was transparent in each net. The main plastic components of the MPs are polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene. The microbial community mainly consists of potentially pathogenic strains such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Acinetobacter baumanii complex. The current study could contribute valuable background information both for MP pollution and for biofilm composition in a dam.

The objective of this study is to characterize, in terms of size, color, morphology and polymeric nature, the Large Microplastics (LMPs), i.e., plastic objects within 1 and 5 mm, sampled on three beaches located within the coastal macro-area of the Pelagos Sanctuary, an international protected zone in the north-western Mediterranean. The beaches have similar morphological characteristics but different degrees of urbanization. LMPs were sampled seasonally for one year. The polymeric nature of a representative subsample of the collected LMPs was investigated using a portable Raman instrument, to assess the feasibility of in situ characterization. In this study, 26,486 items were sorted by typology (Expanded Polystyrene-EPS, fragments, and resin pellets), size, and for fragments and resin pellets, also by color and chemical nature. Statistical data on the quantity, density, type, spatial distribution, and seasonality of the sampled LMPs are presented. Differences in LMP abundance and composition were detected among sites. A seasonality trend emerges from our statistical analysis, depending on both LMP typology and urbanization degrees of the beaches. Our data do not show the existence of a relationship between the size of the investigated MPs and their color, while they suggest that the type of polymer influences the degree of fragmentation. This underlines the need to further investigate the mechanisms leading to the production and dispersion of MPs in coastal areas, taking into account both the urbanization of the beach, and therefore the possible sources of input, and the different types of MPs. Finally, a Raman portable instrument proved to be a valuable aid in performing in situ polymeric characterization of LMPs. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

Sharks are an understudied group regarding their susceptibility to microplastic ingestion. Here, we provide evidence of ingestion of microplastic and other anthropogenic fibres in four demersal sharks species found in the waters of the United Kingdom and investigate whether body burdens of contamination vary according to species, sex or size. Sharks were collected from the North-East Atlantic. Stomachs and digestive tracts of 46 sharks of 4 species were examined and 67% of samples contained at least one contaminant particle. Although we acknowledge modest sample size, estimated particle burden increased with body size but did not vary systematically with sex or species. A total of 379 particles were identified, leading to median estimates ranging from 2 to 7.5 ingested contaminants per animal for the 4 species. The majority were fibrous in nature (95%) and blue (88%) or black (9%) in colour. A subsample of contaminants (N = 62) were subject to FT-IR spectroscopy and polymers identified as: synthetic cellulose (33.3%), polypropylene (25%), polyacrylamides (10%) and polyester (8.3%). The level of risk posed to shark species by this level of contamination is unknown.

Meanwhile, the highest load was observed in STP effluent (5.1%) in rainy season (August). Microplastics were more abundant in water in the rainy season (37.4 ?? 37.0 particles/m3 ) than in the dry season (28.2 ?? 22.2 particles/m3 ). Polyethylene (49%) and polypropylene (18%) were the most abundant polymer types in water, fish, and sediment. Regarding shape of microplastics, fragments were dominant (95%) over fiber and film in water, fish, and sediment. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",
6CP82CPJ,10.3390/jmse8120966,Spatio-temporal variability of anthropogenic and natural wrack accumulations along the driftline: Marine litter overcomes wrack in the northern sandy beaches of Portugal,"Marine litter can end up deposited on sandy beaches and become entangled in the natural wrack, threatening its roles in ecosystems. However, it is currently unknown whether the storage of both artificial and natural accumulations on sandy beaches is correlated. Here, we quantified and compared, by first time, the litter and natural wrack on five sandy beaches in the north of Portugal. Results showed that the amount of marine litter and natural wrack were not correlated. Most of the sandy beaches had more litter than wrack and both artificial and natural accumulations disclosed high spatio-temporal variability. In summer, annual and opportunistic macroalgae dominated the wrack, while the litter was mainly formed by cigarette butts and leftover food. In winter, perennial taxa were more abundant in the wrack and plastics from mussel farming and cotton bud sticks dominated the litter. The macroalga Fucus spp., plastic pieces and materials from fishing were frequent in both periods. This study confirms that, currently, more litter than natural wrack reaches the Northern Portuguese sandy beaches, evidencing the need to take urgent measures against this contamination. Future management measures should consider this spatio-temporal variability to quantify both depositions. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",
PQNULQWH,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111746,Prevalence of entanglements of seabirds in marine debris in the central Portuguese coast,"Plastic pollution and the subsequent entanglement of marine animals is a global and increasing problem. In this study we present an analysis of the seabirds recorded as entangled by a rehabilitation centre and an associated marine animal stranding network, along the central coast of Portugal, between 2008 and 2018. Results show a high annual rate of entangled seabirds (average 6.9%) compared to other studies and fisheries related materials are a relevant cause of seabird entanglement (82%) compared to other debris. When comparing age classes, juveniles were more vulnerable to entanglement than other age classes in the species studied. Regarding the rehabilitation of entangled seabirds, the release rate was higher in non-fishing material entanglement cases. In conclusion, this study highlights the impact of fisheries related material on marine fauna and the need for reinforcement of the existing legislation for protecting seabirds and the implementation of mitigation measures associated with fishing activities. ?? 2020",

Addressing this challenge, the present study has been carried out for the province of Cadiz, Spain. To this end, the influents and effluents of 5 municipal wastewater treatment plants (representing 50 % of the total wastewater in Cadiz) and 2 industrial plants treating wastewater from an industrial estate and a large marine construction firm that builds ships and offshore platforms (5 MWWTPs and 2 IWWTPs) have been studied for the first time. MP levels were higher in IWWTPs than in MWWTPs, especially in the wastewaters from the marine construction company. Removal efficiencies ranged between 78 and 97 %. The size and shape distribution of MPs in the effluents resembled that in the influents, suggesting that no preferential removal of MPs occurred in the MWWTPs or IWWTPs with respect to shape and size. PVC, HDPE, PEMA, PP, PS and PE were the most common MPs detected in the influents of the studied WWTPs. The relative contribution of MPs (MPs/L) to the environment from the IWWTPs compared to that from the MWWTPs was found to be highly significant. Results suggested that around 8.5*1011 of MPs/year could be discharged into the environment by the treated wastewaters under study. The results of this paper comprise useful tools to obtain in-depth knowledge of MPs in different kinds of wastewater treatment plants and map an important environmental location (close to the Straits of Gibraltar linking the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea). ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

This process of oxidation and the mechanism of precipitation are yet unknown. In this paper, the results of the first successful, long-term, on-site experiment of mineral precipitation that ascertains modern, ongoing hydrogenetic deposition of oxide materials from normal seawaters at water depths of 900?€?4500 m of geologically active and inactive environments are presented. We succeeded in the in-situ precipitation experiment on the sea floor and characterized the precipitates using high-resolution and submicron-scale chemical, mineralogical, and structural analyses. The installed artificial plates of glass, ceramics, and plastic yielded spread-out particles of sizes varying from one to a few micrometers in diameter, of coccoid-like irregular shapes, with a maximum of 1,000?€?10,000 individual particles/mm2/year after 12?€?15 years of exposure. The results indicated a continuous substantial growth of the hydrogenetic minerals if both Mn and Fe are supplied to the bottom waters. The mineralogical, chemical, and structural properties of the precipitates are similar to those of the natural precipitates on the seabed that are made up of hydrogenetic ferromanganese crusts and nodules, together with settling sediments, suspended hydrothermal particles, or microbial precipitates from cultivated Mn-oxidizing bacteria. Our work presents new realistic insight into proposed genetic models of marine hydrogenetic ferromanganese deposits in modern diverse ocean environments. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

With the purpose of gradually replacing the use of plastics in cosmetic products (primary microplastics), the use of paraffin in microspheres has recently been applied. Paraffin waxes are composed by organic molecules usually derived from petroleum, thus assumed to be chemically and biologically inert, having a lower (eco)toxicity and residence time compared with plastic particles. However, the low ecotoxicity of paraffin waxes may be somewhat questionable, because some paraffin constituents can be absorbed and catabolized, thus exerting biological effects. The main objective of this study was to understand the potential toxic effects of paraffin microparticles on key physiological processes of the polychaete Hediste diversicolor. To attain this objective, this work assessed the acute and chronic effects of three densities (5, 20, and 80 mg L???1) of four size ranges of paraffin particles (from 100 to 1200 ??m) on this epibenthic organism. Although paraffin wax can be generically considered innocuous, the present study was able to demonstrate a significant inhibition in the activity of acetylcholinesterase in acutely exposed organisms and an increase in the activity of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase under some specific scenarios. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

Results show that in a marine splash zone, E690 low-alloy steel experiences severe uniform corrosion and pitting corrosion, and the corrosion is more severe in the high-temperature non-industrial environment. The relationship between the pitting area changes and the depth can be well fitted to the Boltzmann cumulative distribution function to investigate the corrosion factors. In non-industrial marine splash zone, high content of chloride ions makes the metal surface have a high roughness and anodic dissolution is then promoted. The pitting depth is strongly promoted by anodic dissolution. In the marine splash zone, plastic deformation aggravates the maximum pitting depth, especially in the initial stage and in SO2-pollutant environments, although this effect gradually decreases. Pitting on low plastic deformation area in U bend samples may influenced by receiving electrons, which inhibits the protective FeOOH generation. ?? 2020, ASM International.",

In this study, experimental measurements of the plastic particles wave-induced Lagrangian drift in intermediate water depth are presented investigating the influence of the wave conditions, particle size and density on the motion of relatively large plastic particles. A large influence of the particle density is observed causing particles to float or sink for relative densities lower and larger than water respectively. The measured net drift of the floating particles correlates well with theoretical solutions for particle Stokes drift, where the net drift is proportional to the square of the wave steepness. Floating particles remain at the free water surface because of buoyancy and no evidence of any other influence of particle inertia on the net drift is observed. Nonfloating particles move close to the bed with lower velocity magnitudes than the floating particles?€? motion at the free surface. The drift of nonfloating particles reduces with decreasing wave number, and therefore wave steepness. ?? 2020. The Authors.",

Here, we seek to reveal the latest MP pollution status in the largest freshwater lake of China, Poyang Lake, by comprehensively assessing the abundance, distribution, size, shape, polymer composition, and micro-morphology of MPs in water and sediment, covering a large geographic area of the Lake and its five main river tributaries. High levels of MPs were detected in water (up to 1064 ?? 90 MP/m3) and sediment (up to 1936 ?? 121 MP/kg), with the highest concentrations in the Gan River and the lowest in the national Nature Reserves. While a positive correlation was identified between MP abundance in water and sediment, the size distribution of MPs in between water and sediment was distinct. The dominant MP form in sediment and water was fragment and fiber, respectively. Infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the dominant polymer types including polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl alcohol. Moreover, both ??-FTIR and SEM results suggested significant features of weathering and fragmentation of MPs. This study provides comprehensive data to understand the environmental behavior and pollution magnitude of MPs in China's largest freshwater lake and highlights the significant contribution of smaller-size fractions (0.03?€?0.1 mm) to improve future MP studies in freshwater systems. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
F395Z23E,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111744,Seafloor litter sorting in different domains of Cap de Creus continental shelf and submarine canyon (NW Mediterranean Sea),"We analyzed litter occurrence in 68 underwater video transects performed on the middle/outer continental shelf and submarine canyon off Cap de Creus (NW Mediterranean), an area recently declared Site of Community Importance (SCI). Low densities of urban litter were registered on the shelf (7.2 items ha???1), increasing in abundance towards the deepest part of the submarine canyon, with 188 items ha???1 below 1000 m depth. We hypothesize that the strong bottom currents that recurrently affect this area efficiently move litter objects from the shelf towards the deep. Of all litter items, approximately 50% had a fishing-related origin, mostly longlines entangled on rocks in the canyon head and discarded trawl nets in deeper areas. Over 10% of cold-water colonies observed had longlines entangled, indicating the harmful effects of such practices over benthic habitats. These results should be considered when designing mitigation measures to reduce litter pollution in Cap de Creus SCI. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Their strong adsorption towards the coexisting organic pollutants can cause additional environmental risks. Therefore, the adsorption capacity and mechanisms are necessary information for the comprehensive environmental assessments of both microplastics and organic pollutants. To overcome the lack of adsorption information, five quantitative structure?€?property relationship (QSPR) models were developed for predicting the microplastic/water partition coefficients (log Kd) of organics between polyethylene/seawater, polyethylene/freshwater, polyethylene/pure water, polypropylene/seawater, and polystyrene/seawater. All the QSPR models show good fitting ability (R2 = 0.811?€?0.939), predictive ability (Q2ext = 0.835?€?0.910, RMSEext = 0.369?€?0.752), and robustness (Qcv2 = 0.882?€?0.957). They can be used to predict the Kd values of organic pollutants (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorobenzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, antibiotics perfluorinated compounds, etc.) under different pH conditions. The hydrophobic interaction has been indicated as an important mechanism for the adsorption of organic pollutants to microplastics. In sea waters, the role of hydrogen bond interaction in adsorption is considerable. For polystyrene, ?€?€??€ interaction contributes to the partitioning. The developed models can be used to quickly estimate the adsorption capacity of organic pollutants on microplastics in different types of water, providing necessary information for ecological risk studies of microplastics. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",
YRALVWI5,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127650,Adsorption behavior of the antibiotic levofloxacin on microplastics in the presence of different heavy metals in an aqueous solution,"In recent years, the composite pollution of microplastics with organic pollutants and heavy metal ions in the water environment, including their combined toxicity, has received increasing attention. However, the mechanism underlying the joint effect of antibiotics and heavy metals on the surface behavior of microplastics has not been reported. The primary purpose of this article was to analyze the adsorption of levofloxacin (OFL) onto polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in an aqueous solution. The adsorption behavior was studied using kinetics, thermodynamics, and isotherm models, and the effects of several environmental factors, such as ionic strength, fulvic acid, and heavy metals, were determined. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms models indicated that the whole adsorption process was controlled by both intraparticle and outer diffusion, as well as chemical adsorption, which was the dominant mechanism. Based on the results of the thermodynamic experiment, the adsorption process was a nonspontaneous and exothermic reaction process. Furthermore, the presence of Cu2+, Zn2+, and Cr3+ ions significantly promoted the adsorption of OFL, but the presence of Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions inhibited its adsorption. At the same time, the presence of the ionic strength and fulvic acid remarkably restricted the adsorption process. These findings confirmed that electrostatic interactions, ion exchange, intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and halogen bond cooperation were the main adsorption mechanisms. This paper mainly discusses the interaction between combinations of pollutants with microplastics, which provides theoretical guidance for the interface behavior, migration and transformation of marine microplastics in the actual environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
PBTIDUHH,10.1017/jog.2020.67,Antarctic ice sheet response to sudden and sustained ice-shelf collapse (ABUMIP),"Antarctica's ice shelves modulate the grounded ice flow, and weakening of ice shelves due to climate forcing will decrease their 'buttressing' effect, causing a response in the grounded ice. While the processes governing ice-shelf weakening are complex, uncertainties in the response of the grounded ice sheet are also difficult to assess. The Antarctic BUttressing Model Intercomparison Project (ABUMIP) compares ice-sheet model responses to decrease in buttressing by investigating the 'end-member' scenario of total and sustained loss of ice shelves. Although unrealistic, this scenario enables gauging the sensitivity of an ensemble of 15 ice-sheet models to a total loss of buttressing, hence exhibiting the full potential of marine ice-sheet instability. All models predict that this scenario leads to multi-metre (1-12 m) sea-level rise over 500 years from present day. West Antarctic ice sheet collapse alone leads to a 1.91-5.08 m sea-level rise due to the marine ice-sheet instability. Mass loss rates are a strong function of the sliding/friction law, with plastic laws cause a further destabilization of the Aurora and Wilkes Subglacial Basins, East Antarctica. Improvements to marine ice-sheet models have greatly reduced variability between modelled ice-sheet responses to extreme ice-shelf loss, e.g. compared to the SeaRISE assessments. Copyright ??

Exopolysaccharides are secreted mainly by primary colonisers, bacteria, which is succeeded by secondary colonisers i.e. diatoms. Both diatom (Nitzschia sp.4) and bacteria (Bacillus subtilis) were exposed with substrates separately for 30 days. Diatoms adhere on substrates strongly, not only because of surface roughness of different substrates but also the nanoporous architecture of diatoms which enhanced their embellishment. This study attempted to identify the substrates that adhere to diatoms strongly and was mainly analyzed by scanning electron microscope and further the observations are well supported by math work software (MATLAB). The variation of diatom?€?s binding on different substrates is due to the influence of marine litters on diatom population in ocean beds where they undergo slow degradation releasing macro, micro and nanoparticles besides radicals and ions causing cell death. Therefore a proof-of-concept model is developed to successfully deliver a message concerning benefit of using different diatom species. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

We report macrolitter ingestion by the sandy anemone Bunodactis reynaudi at Muizenberg beach in False Bay, South Africa. Monthly surveys from May 2015 to August 2019 collected 491 ingested litter items (9.4 ?? 14.9 items??month-1, 39.8 ?? 71.5 g??month-1), of which &gt;99% were plastic. The number of ingested items was correlated with the abundance of stranded items and ingestion peaked in autumn when seasonal rains washed more litter into the bay. Most ingested litter was clear (39%), white (16%) and black/purple (15%). Comparison with environmental litter showed selection for flexible plastics, particularly bags/packets and food packaging. Experimental feeding trials found that B. reynaudi selected for pieces of HDPE bag suspended in seawater for 2?€?20 days, suggesting that biofilms enhance the palatability of flexible plastics. Studies are needed to assess the possible impacts of plastic ingestion on B. reynaudi. While only a small proportion of the population currently ingest litter, ingestion might become more common if environmental litter loads increase. This might negatively affect the anemone's ability to respond to other environmental changes such as increasing levels of heavy metal pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In March 2019, we removed as much plastic litter as possible from Aldabra Atoll, a remote UNESCO World Heritage Site, and estimated the money and effort required to remove the remaining debris. We removed 25 tonnes at a cost of $224,537, which equates to around $10,000 per day of clean-up operations or $8,900 per tonne of litter. We estimate that 513 tonnes (95% CI 212?€?814) remains on Aldabra, the largest accumulation reported for any single island. We calculate that removing it will cost approximately $4.68 million and require 18,000 person-hours of labour. By weight, the composition is dominated by litter from the regional fishing industry (83%) and flip-flops from further afield (7%). Given the serious detrimental effects of plastic litter on marine ecosystems, we conclude that clean-up efforts are a vital management action for islands like Aldabra, despite the high financial cost and should be integrated alongside policies directed at ?€?turning off the tap?€?. We recommend that international funding be made available for such efforts, especially considering the transboundary nature of both the marine plastic litter problem and the ecosystem services provided by biodiversity-rich islands. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

Previous oceanographic modelling and current drifter data have been used to predict the movement and accumulation of plastic pollution in the marine environment, but our understanding of the transport and fate through riparian systems is still largely unknown. Here we undertook a proof of concept study by applying open source tracking technology (both GPS (Global Positing System) cellular networks and satellite technology), which have been successfully used in many animal movement studies, to track the movements of individual plastic litter items (500 ml PET (polyethylene terephthalate) drinks bottles) through the Ganges River system (known as the Ganga in India and the Padma and Meghna in Bangladesh, hereafter known as the Ganges) and the Bay of Bengal. Deployed tags were successfully tracked through the Ganges river system and into the Bay of Bengal marine system. The ?€?bottle tags?€? were designed and built (e.g. shape, size, buoyancy) to replicate true movement patterns of a plastic bottle. The maximum distance tracked to date is 2845 km over a period of 94 days. We discuss lessons learnt from the development of these plastic litter tags, and outline how the potential widespread use of this open source technology has the ability to significantly increase understanding of the location of accumulation areas and the timing of large inputs of plastic pollution into the aquatic system. Furthermore, ?€?bottle tags?€? may act as a powerful tool for stimulating social behaviour change, informing science-based policy, and as valuable educational outreach tools for public awareness. ?? 2020 Duncan et al.

Anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems and organisms are steadily increasing. Whether and to what extent these pressures influence marine genetic biodiversity is only starting to be revealed. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we analysed the microbial community structure of 33 individuals of the habitat-forming glass sponge Vazella pourtalesii, as well as reference seawater, sediment, and biofilm samples. We assessed how two anthropogenic impacts, i.e. habitat destruction by trawling and artificial substrate provision (moorings made of composite plastic), correspond with in situ V. pourtalesii microbiome variability. In addition, we evaluated the role of two bottom fishery closures in preserving sponge-associated microbial diversity on the Scotian Shelf, Canada. Our results illustrate that V. pourtalesii sponges collected from protected sites within fishery closures contained distinct and taxonomically largely novel microbial communities. At the trawled site we recorded significant quantitative differences in distinct microbial phyla, such as a reduction in Nitrospinae in the four sponges from this site and the environmental references. Individuals of V. pourtalesii growing on the mooring were significantly enriched in Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia and Cyanobacteria in comparison to sponge individuals growing on the natural seabed. Due to a concomitant enrichment of these taxa in the mooring biofilm, we propose that biofilms on artificial substrates may ?€?prime?€? sponge-associated microbial communities when small sponges settle on such substrates. These observations likely have relevant management implications when considering the increase of artificial substrates in the marine environment, e.g., marine litter, off-shore wind parks, and petroleum platforms. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

The relative catch efficiency between biodegradable and nylon gillnets was evaluated over three consecutive fishing seasons for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in Norway. The biodegradable gillnets progressively lost catch efficiency over time, as they caught 18.4%, 40.2%, and 47.4% fewer fish than the nylon gillnets during the first, second, and third season, respectively. A 1000-hour aging test revealed that both materials began to degrade after just 200 h and that biodegradable gillnets degraded faster than the nylon gillnets. Infrared spectroscopy revealed that the chemical structure of the biodegradable polymer changed more than the nylon. Although less catch efficient than nylon gillnets, biodegradable gillnets have great potential for reducing both capture in lost fishing gear and plastic pollution at sea, which are major problems in fisheries worldwide. ?? 2020 The Authors",

The culture can use the plastic film as the sole carbon source, reaching maximum conversion to CO2 and biomass in around 15 days.

As a new type of solid buoyancy material, the proposed composite material is promising for use in submersible, deep-sea oil risers. This composite material has many advantages, including the ability to bear extreme temperature, corrosion, and hydrostatic pressure up to tens of megapascals. In this study, the hydrostatic compression properties of six different mass filling ratio samples were tested based on an advanced triaxial testing system with varying temperatures. Some basic parameters, such as density, axial and radial stress-strain curves, and volume strain, were obtained. The elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio were subjected to nonlinear fitting. Additionally, the elastic-plastic performance was analyzed according to the residual strain. A new method to characterize the properties of the material is proposed.

In this study, we first characterized the petroleum-based plastic debris and quantified the concentration of arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb) in plastics from the Marina Beach. Results: A total of 2275 samples of the sediments were collected from three different locations across the Marina Beach. Our results showed that plastics debris mainly were three shapes as fiber, sphere, and fragment. The plastic fragments were mechanically eroded and chemically weathered observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Five types of polymers were identified, including low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), and polycarbonate (PC). Their absorbed trace metals, such as Cr, As, Pb, and Cu, were determined by the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The level of As was high in most plastics. However, the highest levels of Pb, Cu, and Cr were in the PA, PP, and PA, respectively, implying the adsorption preference of plastics from different sources. Conclusion: Taken together, this study first characterized petroleum-based plastics and their absorbed trace metals in the sediments of the Marina Beach, indicating that petroleum-based plastics acted as the vectors for the transportation of metal elements in the marine biome.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] ?? 2020, The Author(s).",
WRJN2BN9,10.1038/s41598-020-64855-y,Timing is everything: Drivers of interannual variability in blue whale migration,"Blue whales need to time their migration from their breeding grounds to their feeding grounds to avoid missing peak prey abundances, but the cues they use for this are unknown. We examine migration timing (inferred from the local onset and cessation of blue whale calls recorded on seafloor-mounted hydrophones), environmental conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature anomalies and chlorophyll a), and prey (spring krill biomass from annual net tow surveys) during a 10 year period (2008?€?2017) in waters of the Southern California Region where blue whales feed in the summer. Colder sea surface temperature anomalies the previous season were correlated with greater krill biomass the following year, and earlier arrival by blue whales. Our results demonstrate a plastic response of blue whales to interannual variability and the importance of krill as a driving force behind migration timing. A decadal-scale increase in temperature due to climate change has led to blue whales extending their overall time in Southern California. By the end of our 10-year study, whales were arriving at the feeding grounds more than one month earlier, while their departure date did not change. Conservation strategies will need to account for increased anthropogenic threats resulting from longer times at the feeding grounds. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

Strains available as axenic cultures in most cases have been isolated from aquatic environments and serve as a basis to study planctomycetal cell biology and interactions in further detail. As a contribution to the current collection of axenic cultures, here we characterise three closely related strains, Poly24T, CA51T and Mal33, which were isolated from the Baltic Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, respectively. The strains display cell biological features typical for related Planctomycetes, such as division by polar budding, presence of crateriform structures and formation of rosettes. Optimal growth was observed at temperatures of 30?€?33 ??C and at pH 7.5, which led to maximal growth rates of 0.065?€?0.079 h???1, corresponding to generation times of 9?€?11 h. The genomes of the novel isolates have a size of 7.3?€?7.5 Mb and a G + C content of 57.7?€?58.2%. Phylogenetic analyses place the strains in the family Pirellulaceae and suggest that Roseimaritima ulvae and Roseimaritima sediminicola are the current closest relatives. Analysis of five different phylogenetic markers, however, supports the delineation of the strains from members of the genus Roseimaritima and other characterised genera in the family. Supported by morphological and physiological differences, we conclude that the strains belong to the novel genus Rosistilla gen. nov. and constitute two novel species, for which we propose the names Rosistilla carotiformis sp. nov. and Rosistilla oblonga sp. nov.

The two novel species are represented by the type strains Poly24T (= DSM 102938T = VKM B-3434T = LMG 31347T = CECT 9848T) and CA51T (= DSM 104080T = LMG 29702T), respectively. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

In cetaceans, the most frequent interactions have occurred through ingestion and/or entanglement, with results ranging from minor injuries to death in affected animals. While debris ingestion is widely documented in odontocetes, records are scarcer in mysticetes. This study describes the finding of plastic litter in the digestive tract of a southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) juvenile male, which was found dead on the shores of Golfo Nuevo, Chubut, Argentina in 2014. During the examination of intestinal contents, anthropogenic waste was found and classified as macro-debris (25 mm-1 m). Although this whale likely died of causes not related to this finding, it is the first record of anthropogenic debris ingestion for this species. This event adds information about the potential impact of human-made debris on a variety of aquatic species and ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

A complex lifestyle, their potential for the production of bioactive small molecules, their unusual cell biology and a large number of giant and hypothetical genes in their genomes make these microorganisms a fascinating topic for further research. Here, we characterise three novel planctomycetal strains isolated from polystyrene and polyethylene particles that were submerged in the German part of the Baltic Sea and the estuary of the river Warnow. All three strains showed typical planctomycetal traits such as division by polar budding and formation of rosettes. The isolated strains were mesophilic and neutrophilic chemoheterotrophs and reached generation times of 10?€?25 h during laboratory-scale cultivation. Taxonomically, the three strains belong to the genus Rubripirellula. Based on our analyses all three strains represent novel species, for which we propose the names Rubripirellula amarantea sp. nov., Rubripirellula tenax sp. nov. and Rubripirellula reticaptiva sp. nov.

7CFK7E7Z,10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105094,The role of technological innovation in plastic production within a circular economy framework,"The growing plastic waste problem has been highlighted by nature programmes like the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) War on Plastic series with the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2016 report estimating that by 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in the world's oceans. This has prompted the call for a shift from the linear model of tackling the plastic waste issue to that of a Circular Economy model with increasing demand for recycled resin to be incorporated into the plastic production process alongside virgin resin. However, recycled content are often associated with problems like lack of stability between various combinations of virgin/recycle polymers, which may lead to variations in temperature and inconsistency in the ease of flow attributable to the different temperature and pressure regimes under which virgin raw material and recycled feedstock melt and cool. In this paper, our main contribution is a proposed framework for integrating an enhanced AI/DB interface for analysing historical and real time information/data into a joint DSC-TGA system that allows for simultaneous quality control checks and thermal stability tests on different virgin-recycled resin mixing ratios. The database comes equipped with proven estimation methods, testing and statistical analysis results of different resin specimens to serve as a reference point for production engineers in arriving at desired check and test conditions. The information will be particularly useful to plastic product manufacturers when making decisions regarding the right virgin-recycled mix ratio conditions when using different batches of recycled resin or when they switch a supplier. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
YPGC4CDB,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2020.107963,Finite element modelling for as-laid embedment of pipeline in clayey sediments,"A numerical modelling technique for the estimation of as-laid pipeline embedment in clayey sediments is introduced in the paper. The process of pipe-laying is modelled numerically with the pipe-soil interaction defined using a nonlinear elasto-plastic model, therefore the soil resistance contributed by soil buoyancy can be well considered in the evaluation of as-laid pipeline embedment. The impact of the soil buoyancy in the estimate of as-laid embedment is then quantitatively assessed using the proposed numerical modelling technique, and the results show that the as-laid pipeline embedment can be significantly overestimated if the soil buoyancy is ignored in the analysis. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
WTVX72FP,10.1007/s11160-020-09617-9,Estimating maturity from size-at-age data: Are real-world fisheries datasets up to the task?,"The size and age at which individuals mature is rapidly changing due to plastic and evolved responses to fisheries harvest and global warming. Understanding the nature of these changes is essential because maturity schedules are critical in determining population demography and ultimately, the economic value and viability of fisheries. Detecting maturity changes is, however, practically difficult and costly. A recently proposed biphasic growth modelling likelihood profiling method offers great potential as it can statistically estimate age-at-maturity from population-level size-at-age data, using the change-point in growth that occurs at maturity. Yet, the performance of the method on typical marine fisheries datasets remains untested. Here, we assessed the suitability of 12 North Sea and Australian species?€? datasets for the likelihood profiling approach. The majority of the fisheries datasets were unsuitable as they had too small sample sizes or too large size-at-age variation. Further, datasets that did satisfy data requirements generally showed no correlation between empirical and model-derived maturity estimates. To understand why the biphasic approach had low performance we explored its sensitivity using simulated datasets. We found that method performance for marine fisheries datasets is likely to be low because of: (1) truncated age structures due to intensive fishing, (2) an under-representation of young individuals in datasets due to common fisheries-sampling protocols, and (3) large intrapopulation variability in growth curves. To improve our ability to detect maturation changes from population level size-at-age data we need to improve data collection protocols for fisheries monitoring. ?? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

As a result, an important phenomenon of plastic hinge transfer can occur, which has a significant effect on the seismic performance of the coastal structures. However, this problem has seldom been studied. The plastic hinge transfer phenomenon has been observed in previous cyclic loading and shaking table tests of the authors [1,2]. In this study, a further study focusing on the changing time of different failure modes and the plastic hinge length is conducted. First, the possible failure modes resulted from the non-uniform corrosion are discussed, in terms of the distribution of plasticity at the ultimate state. Then, a finite element modeling method of the bridge columns with different service time is developed. Equations that can predict the failure mode are proposed based on multi-parameter regression analysis. Finally, a flowchart describing the rapid determination method of the time-dependent failure mode and the way to obtain the equivalent plastic hinge length is proposed. The results indicate that the prediction method is with high accuracy and efficiency, which is helpful for the seismic performance design and evaluation of the coastal bridges during the entire service life. ?? 2020 Institution of Structural Engineers",
HBANY6HR,10.1007/s00170-020-06203-y,Ecofriendly inclined drilling of carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP),"Key composite made aerostructures such as fuselage inner walls, flap support fairings, empennage ribs, and the vertical fin ribs are comprised of non-vertical inclined and radial holes that join with other key metallic and non-metallic structures. Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) are also used in the aerospace, automotive, marine, and sports-related applications due to their superior properties such as high strength to weight ratio, better fatigue, and high stiffness. CFRP drilling operation is different than the homogenous materials as the cutting-edge interacts with fiber and matrix simultaneously. Flank face of the tool rubs on the workpiece material and develops high frictional contact due to the elastic recovery of broken fibers. Lubrication during CFRP cutting can reduce the friction involved at tool-workpiece interface to enhance cutting performance. Dry cutting, cryogenic machining, and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL)-based strategies are termed as ecofriendly cooling/lubrication methods when machining high performance materials. The abrasive nature of carbon fiber is responsible of producing cutting forces which leads to different types of imperfections such as delamination, uncut fiber, fiber breakout, and fiber pullout. The integrity of CFRP drilled hole especially at the entry and exit of the hole plays a significant role towards the overall service life. The presented paper aims to characterize the interrelationships between hole inclination, lubrication/cooling methods, tool coating, and drill geometry with inclined hole bore surface quality and integrity during drilling of CFRP laminates. In dry cutting, thrust forces were found 2.38 times higher in the 30?? inclination when compared with the reference 90?? conventional inclination angle. Compressed air provided lowest increase (1.46 times) in the thrust forces for 30?? inclination. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",
GPXX6ZJK,10.3390/polym12122928,Monomer selection for in situ polymerization infusion manufacture of natural-fiber reinforced thermoplastic-matrix marine composites,"Awareness of environmental issues has led to increasing interest from composite researchers in using ?€?greener?€? materials to replace synthetic fiber reinforcements and petrochemical polymer matrices. Natural fiber bio-based thermoplastic composites could be an appropriate choice with advantages including reducing environmental impacts, using renewable resources and being recyclable. The choice of polymer matrix will significantly affect the cost, manufacturing process, mechanical properties and durability of the composite system. The criteria for appropriate monomers are based on the processing temperature and viscosity, polymer mechanical properties, recyclability, etc. This review considers the selection of thermoplastic monomers suitable for in situ polymerization during resin, now monomer, infusion under flexible tooling (RIFT, now MIFT), with a primary focus on marine composite applications. Given the systems currently available, methyl methacrylate (MMA) may be the most suitable monomer, especially for marine composites. MMA has low process temperatures, a long open window for infusion, and low moisture absorption. However, end-of-life recovery may be limited to matrix depolymerization. Bio-based MMA is likely to become commercially available in a few years. Polylactide (PLA) is an alternative infusible monomer, but the relatively high processing temperature may require expensive consumable materials and could compromise natural fiber properties. ?? 2020 by the authors.

RGMVLT2R,10.1016/j.tws.2020.107031,Crushing characteristic of polygonal tubes with hierarchical triangular cells,"This paper proposes N-sided polygonal tubes with hierarchical triangular cells (PHTNs) for use as energy-absorbing devices. Different cross sections of the PHTNs are obtained by changing the number of sides and cells of the sandwich wall. Quasi-static compression experiments and finite element (FE) simulations are used to analyse the axial crushing behaviour and energy absorption performance of the PHTNs. The results show that the PHTNs has two deformation modes: when N ??? 24, the deformation mode is progressive folding, whereas when N > 24, the deformation mode is sandwich folding. The 24-sided PHTN (PHT24) exhibits the best energy absorption performance, and the specific energy absorption (SEA) of PHT24 is 110.37% greater than the minimum SEA, which is exhibit by PHT06. The results also reveal that the energy absorption is improved mainly by shortening the wavelength or increasing the plastic bending moment of the sandwich wall. Finally, theoretical models are established for predicting the mean crushing force in the PHTNs under both deformation modes. The predictions from these models are in good agreement with the FE simulation results, thereby indicating that the predictions are highly accurate. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

We found that the woody film was not easily degraded by cultured solution of hand bacteria (phylum Proteobacteria was dominant). However, the film was easily biodegraded when in cultured solution of soil (Firmicutes, especially class Bacilli, was dominant) for 4 weeks at 37 ??C, or when buried in the soil itself, both under aerobic conditions (Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria were dominant) for 40 days at room temperature and under anaerobic conditions (Firmicutes, especially family Ruminococcaceae, was dominant) for 5 weeks at 37 ??C. Moreover, when film was buried in the soil, more carbon dioxide was generated than from soil alone. Therefore, the film was not only brittle but formed of decomposable organic matter. We showed that the film does not decompose at the time of use when touched by the hand, but it decomposes easily when buried in the soil after use. We suggest that this biodegradable woody film can be used as a sustainable raw material in the future. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

Numerical results are presented for the composite propeller which has been modeled by unidirectionally stacking with glass-fiber reinforced composites. The propulsive efficiency of the composite and rigid propellers with different advance coefficients J has been compared. The results show that the efficiency of the composite propeller is obviously higher than that of the rigid propeller when J???0.8, which is attributed to the decrease of pitch angle caused by the bend-twist coupling effects. But for the design condition J=0.851 and the cases with J 0.851, the efficiency of the composite propeller is significantly lower than that of the rigid propeller, which is because the angle of attack ??composite is deviated from the optimal angle of attack ??design more than that for the rigid case ??rigid. Based on the optimization by the proposed pre-deformated method, the efficiency improvement of the composite propeller at the conditions with J???0.851 could be obtained, and the composite material used in this work can meet the strength requirement of the designed propellers. ?? 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

Auxetic structures of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and poly-lactic acid (PLA) materials are fabricated. Three process parameters of FDM namely layer thickness, raster angle, and number of contours are considered to investigate their influence on compressive strength, stiffness, and specific energy absorption (SEA). Experiments are performed on the basis of central composite design and analysis is performed using ANOVA. It is found that compressive strength of auxetic structure improves with increase in layer thickness. But with increase in raster angle, it increases first and then decreases. Compressive stiffness of structures initially decreases and then increases with increase in raster angle, while it increases with increase in number of contours. SEA of structures increases with decrease in layer thickness. Based on the analysis of experimental results, regression models are developed to predict these responses. Also, multi-response optimization is performed to optimize strength, stiffness, and SEA. Auxetic structures failed under compressive loading are also examined using scanning electron microscope. ?? 2020 Society of Plastics Engineers",

Moreover, carbon tubes experienced the smallest degradation while glass and basalt tubes showed almost the same range of degradation. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
DQXYL244,10.1038/s41467-020-17438-4,Mimicry of emergent traits amplifies coastal restoration success,"Restoration is becoming a vital tool to counteract coastal ecosystem degradation. Modifying transplant designs of habitat-forming organisms from dispersed to clumped can amplify coastal restoration yields as it generates self-facilitation from emergent traits, i.e. traits not expressed by individuals or small clones, but that emerge in clumped individuals or large clones. Here, we advance restoration science by mimicking key emergent traits that locally suppress physical stress using biodegradable establishment structures. Experiments across (sub)tropical and temperate seagrass and salt marsh systems demonstrate greatly enhanced yields when individuals are transplanted within structures mimicking emergent traits that suppress waves or sediment mobility. Specifically, belowground mimics of dense root mats most facilitate seagrasses via sediment stabilization, while mimics of aboveground plant structures most facilitate marsh grasses by reducing stem movement. Mimicking key emergent traits may allow upscaling of restoration in many ecosystems that depend on self-facilitation for persistence, by constraining biological material requirements and implementation costs. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

We use the crustal velocity field of the Plate Boundary Observatory to illuminate the distribution of horizontal flow beneath the California margin. At lower-crustal and upper-mantle depths, the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates is off-centered from the San Andreas fault, concentrated in a region that encompasses the trace of nearby active faults. A major step is associated with return flow below the Eastern California Shear Zone, leading to the extrusion of the Mojave block and a re-distribution of fault activity since the Pleistocene.

Tensile properties were evaluated using instrumented indentation testing (IIT) with a spherical indenter and microstructure observations were obtained under an optical microscope. IIT performed on the base material at room temperature (RT) and ???163???C, a cryogenic temperature (CT), gave results in good agreement with those of tensile testing. The strength of each zone was higher in the order of heat-affected zone (HAZ) &lt; weld nugget (WN) &lt; base material (BM) because the amount of cold working was least in the BM, heavy metal elements and carbon vaporized during melting, and the WN was formed more tightly than the HAZ, effectively constraining the plastic zone generated by the indentation. As for the welding current, the nugget, which becomes larger and tighter as the current increases, more effectively constrained the plastic zone in the indentation, and this soon increased the strength. Generally, Invar is known to consist of single-phase austenite, and microstructure observations have confirmed that the average grain size is ordered as BM &lt; HAZ &lt; WN. Fan-like columnar grains developed in the direction of the temperature gradient, and equiaxed grains were observed near the BM. It was confirmed that the grain size in the WN also increases as the current is increased. Interestingly, the constraint effect with increasing nugget size was more important for strength than the grain size. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

Based on the characteristics of thaw-induced settlement of frozen soil, a thermal-fluid-soil coupling numerical model was developed in this study to analyze the probability of settlement at wellbores drilled in the cold sea areas of polar regions. The results show that the thawing of frozen soil due to the heat transfer from hot fluid flowing in the casing to the frozen soil layer is an important reason for the instability of the wellhead. The wellhead subsidence is due not only to an overall formation settlement that results from the thawing of large areas of frozen soil but also to the collapse of the formation surrounding the wellhead due to the accumulation of plastic deformation. The thickness of frozen soil depends on the seafloor temperature, but the thickness of frozen soil and the seafloor temperature exert contrary influences on the stability of the wellhead. A thicker frozen soil layer requires a lower seafloor temperature, leading to higher instability. However, a lower temperature is favorable for the stability of the wellhead. The wellhead stability is a result of the comprehensive interaction of these two factors. Improvement in the heat-insulating property of the casing is an effective method for maintaining the stability of the wellhead. When the thermal conductivity of the casing is lower than 0.1 W ?? (m??C), the stability time of the wellhead is feasible for the duration of general drilling operations. These research findings provide a theoretical basis for maintaining wellhead stability during drilling operations in cold regions. ?? 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

Here, we describe the microstructure of the critically endangered staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) skeleton and its mechanical properties, spectral and fluidic behavior, including uniaxial compressive strength, resistance to plastic deformation, spectral vibrational response, and flow-field analysis. We evaluated skeletons of A. cervicornis retrieved from a nursery off Broward County, Florida, USA. Optical micrographs and X-ray computed topography revealed a complex system of canals and pores that allow rapid skeletal elongation while retaining sufficient strength to withstand currents, waves, and other physical forces. Compressive loading of the aragonite skeleton resulted in complex stress?€?strain deformation behavior; the unique pore arrangement resisted catastrophic cracks and prevented instantaneous failure. Vickers microhardness was 3.56 ?? 0.31 GPa, which is typical for soft aragonite materials yet sufficient to withstand the hydraulic pressure of ocean waves. Impressions made by the diamond indenter had almost no cracks radiating from their corners, which again demonstrated the ability of the complex skeleton microstructure to suppress crack formation and growth (e.g., from the bites of grazers).

However, the ??1 peak?€?s position barely changed (from 1083.6 cm???1 outside the impression to 1083.9 cm???1 in the center), indicating weak stress sensitivity. Flow-field analysis revealed small-scale, counter-rotating vortices formed in the skeleton?€?s wake, which can entrain food particles within range of polyp tentacles and facilitate transport of respiratory gases and wastes. Considered together, our results demonstrate that the perforate skeleton of A. cervicornis is well-adapted to withstand physical forces normally encountered in its shallow-water habitat, but may be susceptible to anthropogenic stressors that alter its architecture. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",
PV9JHFPX,10.1007/s13344-020-0073-x,Mechanical Properties Study of Reinforced Thermoplastic Pipes Under A Tensile Load,"This paper presents a study on the tensile properties of reinforced thermoplastic pipes (RTPs). A mechanical model of RTPs with an arbitrary number of reinforced layers under tensile action is constructed by combining the constitutive relationship of elastoplastic materials with the continuous displacement condition. On this basis, the effects of various parameters such as the winding angle, the number of structurally reinforced layers, and the inner polyethylene (PE) liner thickness on the tensile properties of the RTPs were analyzed, and a tensile test was carried out for validation. The results showed that the winding angle of the structurally reinforced layers was the main factor affecting an RTP?€?s tensile performance?€?decreases in the winding angle significantly improved its tensile ability, especially the longitudinal strength. With ??45?? as the demarcation point, the winding angle smaller than ??45?? will result in higher strength in longitudinal direction, and the lifting effect on RTP?€?s mechanical properties of the increasing number of reinforcement layers was better than that of the increasing thickness of the lining layer; when the winding angle was larger than ??45??, the opposite results were obtained. The fibre load was more sensitive to the winding angle than the PE load. ?? 2020, Chinese Ocean Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

Voltage-controlled reversible responses have demonstrated potential for reliable reproducibility and stability, fast response, and for actuating thin films fixed over large solid surfaces. To obtain reversible deformation with regular geometric patterns, however, electrical methods have had to be coupled with mechanical stretching/bending and other ways to induce anisotropy. There is a great need and potential for on-demand electrical generation of programmable complex responsive surface patterns. Here we demonstrate a responsive polymer coating over an underlying pattern of counter electrodes which can be activated selectively. We present a patternable electrode printing method to achieve localized and structured wrinkling deformation without mechanical pre-force deformation. We discover that below a minimal separation distance, electrodes below the polymer act as a single electrode. We establish parameters that govern the alignment of wrinkles and quantify the regularity and direction of the new patterns between electrodes separated by larger than this distance. We analyze and quantify the regularity of the formed wrinkling patterns by four disorder metrics: box-counting fractal dimension, tortuosity, angle distribution, and branch number. We demonstrate the application of such electrode/wrinkles-on-demand patterning with a working multi-state light reflection?€?diffusion?€?grating device. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The composite material repair method is very practical and efficient for external corroded pipes, and it has been widely used in recent years. In this paper, to study the interfacial stresses of a corroded pipe repaired with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP), a theoretical mechanical model of a perfect pipe repaired with CFRP is constructed firstly, and then the interface stresses are obtained for the reinforced pipe under tension and bending, with a modification of stresses using the residual strength factor. the interface stresses are obtained for the reinforced pipe under tension and bending, with a modification of stresses using the residual strength factor. The debonding load for the corroded pipe repaired with CFRP is calculated based on the damage failure criteria of the adhesive layer. A finite element model (FEM) for corroded pipes repaired with CFRP is constructed to achieve the interface stresses and the debonding load, and the tension experiment is also done to achieve the initial debonding loads. The theoretical results and FEM results are found to have good coherence with the experimental results. Finally, the relationship between the debonding load and the aging time is obtained based on the degradation rules of adhesive peeling and shear strength. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
B96JSJKC,10.1002/pat.5050,Development of modified polyacrylonitrile fibers for improving tribological performance characteristics of thermoplastic polyurethane material in water-lubricated sliding bearings,"Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is one of the most popular marine bearing materials because of its excellent characteristics. However, severe wear often occurs under some extreme conditions. In order to improve the service life of bearing material, this work introduced the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber as a reinforcement material to further enhance TPU tribological properties. Considering that the bearing material does not process self-lubricating or cannot form a stable water film under some working conditions, the PAN fiber was hydrophilically modified to alleviate this problem. The effects of fiber addition, operation speed, and applied load on the tribological properties of the composites were examined by using a tribo-tester. The friction coefficient of the samples, the surface morphology after rubbing, and the wear loss, and so on, were also comprehensively analyzed. It was found that the friction coefficient of 30% modified PAN fiber at 500 r/min and 0.8 MPa load was 0.08, and its friction coefficient was 81.8% lower than the pure sample under the same working condition, this is mainly due to the high hydrophilicity of the modified PAN fiber, which makes it easier to form a water film between the composite material and the copper disc. Furthermore, adhesive wear occurred in unmodified samples, while modified samples contained abrasive wear. This new material modification method and design idea can be used for improving the performance of water-lubricated bearing materials. ?? 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",
VB92PI8Y,10.1007/s13344-020-0071-z,Penetration Resistance of Skirt-Tip with Rough Base for Suction Caissons in Clay,"Suction caissons can readily penetrate into the seabed under the combination of the self-weight and suction resulted from the encased water being increasingly pumped out. During suction-assisted penetration, the equivalent overburden at the skirt-tip level outside the caisson is generally higher than that inside because the vertical stress within the soil plug is reduced by the exerted suction. This may result in a uniform shear stress developing over the base of the skirt-tip as the soil below the skirt-tip tends to move into the caisson, which leads to an asymmetric failure wedge existing below the base of the skirt-tip. Besides, different adhesion factors along the inside (??1) and outside (??o) of the skirt wall will cause asymmetric plastic zones inside and outside the caisson. Accordingly, an asymmetric failure mechanism is therefore proposed to calculate the penetration resistance of the skirt-tip. The proposed failure mechanism is the first to consider the effect of different adhesion factors (??i) and (??o) on the failure mechanism at the skirt-tip, and involves the contribution from the weighted average of equivalent overburdens inside and outside caisson at the skirt-tip level. The required suction pressure can be obtained in terms of force equilibrium of the caisson in a vertical direction. Finally, the asymmetric failure mechanism at the skirt-tip is validated with the FE calculations. By comparing with the measured data, the predictions of the required suction pressure are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. ?? 2020, Chinese Ocean Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",
B7IJDVKV,10.1186/s12903-020-01337-7,Environmental sustainability in endodontics. A life cycle assessment (LCA) of a root canal treatment procedure,"Background: To analyse via life cycle analysis (LCA) the global resource use and environmental output of the endodontic procedure. Methodology: An LCA was conducted to measure the life cycle of a standard/routine two-visit RCT. The LCA was conducted according to the International Organization of Standardization guidelines; ISO 14040:2006. All clinical elements of an endodontic treatment (RCT) were input into OpenLCA software using process and flows from the ecoinvent database. Travel to and from the dental clinic was not included. Environmental outputs included abiotic depletion, acidification, freshwater ecotoxicity/eutrophication, human toxicity, cancer/non cancer effects, ionizing radiation, global warming, marine eutrophication, ozone depletion, photochemical ozone formation and terrestrial eutrophication. Results: An RCT procedure contributes 4.9 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) emissions. This is the equivalent of a 30 km drive in a small car. The main 5 contributors were dental clothing followed by surface disinfection (isopropanol), disposable bib (paper and plastic), single-use stainless steel instruments and electricity use. Although this LCA has illustrated the effect endodontic treatment has on the environment, there are a number of limitations that may influence the validity of the results. Conclusions: The endodontic team need to consider how they can reduce the environmental burden of endodontic care. One immediate area of focus might be to consider alternatives to isopropyl alcohol, and look at paper, single use instrument and electricity use. Longer term, research into environmentally-friendly medicaments should continue to investigate the replacement of current cytotoxic gold standards with possible natural alternatives. Minimally invasive regenerative endodontics techniques designed to stimulate repair or regeneration of damaged pulp tissue may also be one way of improving the environmental impact of an RCT. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

Several methods were accomplished for this study: petrophysical evaluation, sedimentological and petrographical descriptions and well log analysis. Based on the petrophysical study, the Kaimiro Formation is interpreted to have several flow units ranges up to 15 ??m. Higher RQI and FZI reflect potential reservoir, while the pore size and pore throat diameters (r35) are found to be within the range of macro- and megapores, on the contrary to macropores related to poor reservoir quality concentrated in Tui-1 well. This is in good agreement with other measurements that show the formation is exhibited to be a good promising reservoir as the formation comprises a good average porosity of 19.6% and a good average permeability of 879.45 mD. The sedimentological and petrographical studies display that several diagenetic features have been affecting the formation such as compaction, cementation, dissolution and the presence of authigenic clay minerals. Although these features commonly occur, the impact on the reservoir properties and quality is minor as primary and secondary pores are still observed within the Kaimiro sandstone. Moreover, well log analysis is also completed to further ensure the hydrocarbon potential of the formation through a qualitative and quantitative analysis. It has been confirmed that the Kaimiro Formation is a promising reservoir containing several flow units with higher possibility for storage capacity. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",
GRJCF4VI,10.1038/s41598-020-57980-1,Treatment of Coral Wounds by Combining an Antiseptic Bilayer Film and an Injectable Antioxidant Biopolymer,"Coral reefs are vital for the marine ecosystem and their potential disappearance can have unequivocal consequences on our environment. Aside from pollution-related threats (changes in water temperature, plastics, and acidity), corals can be injured by diseases, predators, humans and other invasive species. Diseases play an important role in this decline, but so far very few mitigation strategies have been proposed and developed to control this threat. In this work, we demonstrate that recently developed bi-layer human skin wound treatment patches containing antiseptics and natural antioxidants with controlled-release capacity can be adapted to treat scleractinian coral wounds effectively. A hydrophilic bilayer film based on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and hyaluronic acid was used to cover the open wounds while delivering the antiseptics for rapid action. Afterwards, the hydrophilic bi-layer covered wound was sealed with an antioxidant and hydrophobic ??-caprolactone-p-coumaric acid copolymer by melt injection at low temperatures. Treated coral injuries were monitored both in aquaria system and in natural environment in Maldives for over 4 months to reduce the number of entry points for organisms that could lead to diseases. The corals well-tolerated both biomaterials as well as the antiseptics incorporated in these materials. The treatments displayed self-adhering properties, tuneable dissolution time, and biocompatibility and stimulated regeneration properties within the coral wound. As such, this work demonstrates that certain human skin wound treatment materials can be successfully adapted to the curing of coral wounds and delivery of specific drugs to slow down, reduce or even stop the spread of diseases in scleractinian corals as well as in all other benthic organisms affected by uncontrolled pathologies. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",
2AVHBT9E,10.1002/ece3.6945,"Allometric relationships in morphological traits associated with foraging, swimming ability, and predator defense reveal adaptations toward brackish and freshwater environments in the threespine stickleback","Freshwater colonization by threespine stickleback has led to divergence in morphology between ancestral marine and derived freshwater populations, making them ideal for studying natural selection on phenotypes. In an open brackish?€?freshwater system, we previously discovered two genetically distinct stickleback populations that also differ in geometric shape: one mainly found in the brackish water lagoon and one throughout the freshwater system. As shape and size are not perfectly correlated, the aim of this study was to identify the morphological trait(s) that separated the populations in geometric shape. We measured 23 phenotypes likely to be important for foraging, swimming capacity, and defense against predation. The lateral plate morphs in freshwater displayed few significant changes in trait sizes, but the low plated expressed feeding traits more associated with benthic habitats. When comparing the completely plated genetically assigned populations, the freshwater, the hybrids, the migrants and the lagoon fish, many of the linear traits had different slopes and intercepts in trait-size regressions, precluding our ability to directly compare all traits simultaneously, which most likely results from low variation in body length for the lagoon and migrant population. We found the lagoon stickleback population to be more specialized toward the littoral zone, displaying benthic traits such as large, deep bodies with smaller eyes compared to the freshwater completely plated morph. Further, the lagoon and migrant fish had an overall higher body coverage of lateral plates compared to freshwater fish, and the dorsal and pelvic spines were longer. Evolutionary constraints due to allometric scaling relationships could explain the observed, overall restricted, differences in morphology between the sticklebacks in this study, as most traits have diversified in common allometric trajectories. The observed differences in foraging and antipredation traits between the fish with a lagoon and freshwater genetic signature are likely a result of genetic or plastic adaptations toward brackish and freshwater environments. ?? 2020 The Authors.

Pacific razor clams (Siliqua patula), important for local indigenous culture, economy, gastronomy and food security along the United States West Coast, are subjected to myriad environmental stressors including predation, storm events, disease, toxins, and MPs. This study aimed to determine MP burdens in Olympic Coast, Washington Pacific razor clams and estimate annual MP exposure of recreational razor clam harvester-consumers from eating this species. We quantified suspected MP burdens in Pacific razor clams collected from eight tribal, recreational, and commercial harvest areas on the Olympic Coast in April 2018. We administered questionnaires to 107 recreational razor clam harvesters during the same timeframe to determine consumption patterns, preparation styles, knowledge and concerns about MPs, and demographics. Razor clams containing suspected MPs, primarily microfibers, were found at all eight sites. Average suspected MP burden differed by sample type (whole = 6.75 ?? 0.60, gut-tissue = 7.88 ?? 0.71, non-gut tissue = 4.96 ?? 0.56, and cleaned samples = 3.44 ?? 0.25). FTIR analyses of a random subset of microfiber-type MPs in whole and cleaned clams indicated material types of polyethylene terephthalate, cellulose acetate, cellophane, polyester, nylon, and cellulose. The average number of razor clams consumed per meal by Olympic Coast recreational razor clam harvesters was 4.27 ?? 0.27, which varied by gender and ethnicity, but not income or age. Harvesters ate 0?€?209 meals/year of razor clams (16.2% harvested but did not eat razor clams), and most respondents (88.3%) fully cleaned razor clams before consuming them. Annual suspected MP exposure for razor clam harvester-consumers was 60?€?3,070 for cleaned and 120?€?6,020 for whole clams. Our findings suggest Olympic Coast recreational razor clam harvester-consumers are exposed to low levels of MPs from eating razor clams. MP exposure can be reduced by roughly 50% if clams are cleaned before consumption. Our work serves as an important reference in the growing portfolio of Pacific Northwest microplastic research, to inform future MP attenuation recommendations and development of human health standards for this type of pollution. ??

C4BB2YBH,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120881,Compressive behavior of FRP-wrapped seawater sea-sand concrete with a square cross-section,"Seawater sea-sand concrete (SSC) has attracted increasing attention as an alternative to normal concrete due to unsustainable usage and overexploitation of resources (e.g., gravel and river sand). The high chloride content of SSC has hindered its widespread applications since the conventional steel reinforcement is easy to be corroded by the abundance of chloride ions in SSC. Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites that are exempt from most corrosion problems have been introduced in the construction of SSC members. This paper presents a series of axial compressive tests on the square SSC columns wrapped with carbon and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) FRP jackets, the latter of which are cost-effective and environmentally friendly and have a large rupture strain (LRS). The experimental program included the axial compressive tests on 36 square columns wrapped with PET-FRP or CFRP jackets and 9 control cylinders. Based on the axial compressive tests, the effects of the SSC mixing water as well as the type and layers of FRP jackets were carefully investigated. The measured stress?€?strain curves of the column specimens were compared with the predictions by existing concrete confinement models to examine their reliability in predicting the compressive behavior of CFRP/PET FRP-wrapped square SSC columns. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In traditional metal materials, the evolution of strength and elongation are mutually inconsistent. The multiple principal elements CuAl10Fe5Ni5Mn1.2(wt%) alloy shows the simultaneous improvement of strength and toughness. The present work has systematically studied the strengthening and plasticity behaviors of CuAl10Fe5Ni5Mn1.2(wt%) alloy under complex stirring. The mechanisms responsible for both increasing its strength and plasticity were clarified. It is found that the properties of novel Al10Fe5Ni5Mn1.2 (wt%) alloy are better than other aluminum bronze alloys. Its Rm is 729 MPa, A5.65 is 16% and yield strength (Rp0.2) is 382 MPa. K phases with nano structures distribute in the grains boundaries complete boundaries strengthening. Schmid factor for the basal slip system is from 0.3 to 0.5, which could largely contribute to grain boundary migration and grain rotation. Twinning deformation is initiated and it can open the low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) and media angle grain boundaries (MAGBs), so the proper combination of strain hardening and plastic deformation enables CuAl10Fe5Ni5Mn1.2 wt% to undergo uniform deformation with micro-nano structures, result in increasing the toughness. The solid solution forms atom scale strengthening. Nano-structures and micron K phase form nano-micro scale strengthening, respectively.

Application of the Sand Rake Method,"Most marine litter monitoring methods used on beaches focus on macro-litter (&gt;25 mm) only and show shortcomings regarding smaller litter classes (&lt;25 mm), especially at Baltic Sea beaches. Therefore, we used a sand rake method developed for large micro- (2?€?5 mm), and meso- (5?€?25 mm) litter to quantify the overall pollution status of Baltic Sea beaches and to test if the method is useful in terms of the requirements of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Between July 2017 and October 2019, 197 sand rake method surveys were carried out at 35 regions around the Baltic Sea. In total, 9345 litter pieces were found on an area of 10,271 m2 of which 69.9% were 2?€?25 mm in size. Artificial polymers (4921 litter pieces) were predominant (mean 52.7% ?? 13.3). Abundance of litter was 0.91 pieces/m2 ?? 1.50 (median 0.40 pieces/m2). The most common litter were industrial pellets (19.8%), non-identifiable plastic pieces 2?€?25 mm (17.3%), cigarette butts (15.3%), and paraffin (11.9%). At 15 surveys at the German North Sea island of Sylt the litter abundance ranged from 0.45 pieces/m2 (median) to 0.59 pieces/m2 ?? 0.37 (mean). Here, 69.2% of the litter was 2?€?25 mm in size and paraffin was predominant (69.2%). Beaches show a high pollution level with large micro- and meso-litter (2?€?25 mm) and our data can serve as a Baltic-wide pollution baseline. In contrast to the naked eye OSPAR method for macro-litter, the sand rake method is generally applicable on all sandy beaches, both urban and remote. This method also allows for the provision of a full spatial pollution pattern and can serve for assessing the effectiveness of marine litter mitigation measures. ??

However, if plastics are not disposed properly and released into the environment, they become a global problem. Especially the high longevity and durability of plastics lead to undesirable accumulations in terrestrial and aquatic systems. Therefore, both seas and soils become final sinks. Because of that, the prevention of plastic waste in the environment must be highest priority. A solution is needed for those cases in which an entry into the environment cannot be avoided or recycling is not possible. Biodegradable plastics are a possible answer here. Especially, the biopolymer poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) presents itself as a promising material, although its high brittleness causes some challenges. To address this issue, PHBV was blended with the biopolymer PBAT and a biodegradable plasticizer was added. While analyzing the rheological and mechanical properties, it was observed that with increasing PBAT and plasticizer concentration, both viscosity and Young's modulus decreased while the elongation at break and impact strength increased. ?? 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

In this study, the patterns of microplastic contamination in surface water and sediment from 58 sites, and living fish from 31 sites were investigated in a semi-closed bay (Laizhou Bay, China). Microplastics in Laizhou Bay were pervasively distributed, particularly in the form of fibers. Microplastic abundance exhibited no significant differences among regions in either surface waters or sediments, indicating multiple sources of microplastics pollution in the bay. Spatial hotspot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis demonstrated that microplastic pollution was mainly concentrated in the Laizhou-Weifang area, which in turn was mainly affected by ocean current dynamics. Although the spatial distribution of microplastics in sediments was different from surface water, it was also affected by geology, hydrogeology, and anthropogenic activities. The most common polymer in the surface waters was polyethylene terephthalate (PET), while cellophane (CP) was the most frequently observed polymer in sediment, suggesting different sinking behaviors of these microplastics. The proportion of low-density microplastics (PE and PP) in surface water was approximately 19.9%, but these microplastics accounted for only approximately 1.7% in the sediment, suggesting that low-density microplastic particles preferentially migrate to open sea. There were significant differences in shape, size and polymer type of the microplastics among surface water, sediment and biota (p < 0.05). Cluster analysis suggested that the Gudong, Yellow River Estuary and Laizhou-Weifang regions are three sources of microplastics, which might originate from river input, plastic recycling and marine raft aquaculture. Furthermore, microplastic particle diversity was greater in sediment at offshore sites, suggesting that these sites receive microplastics from multiple sources. Our results characterize the microplastic pollution pattern, clarify the possible transfer mechanisms between different environmental media, and will provide important information for risk evaluation and pollution control in this area. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Due to the small size, MPs can be ingested by animals and enter the marine trophic chain. MPs can affect animal health by physically causing damage to the digestive tract, leaking plastic chemical components, and carrying environmental pollutants and pathogens into animals. In this study, impacts of MPs ingestion on gut microbiota were investigated. Filter feeding mussels were exposed to ?€?virgin?€? and ?€?weathered?€? MPs at relatively realistic concentration 0.2 mg L???1 (?€?low?€?) and exaggerated concentration 20 mg L???1 (?€?high?€?) for 6 weeks. Influence in mussel gut microbiota was investigated with 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. As compared with non-exposed mussels, alteration of gut microbiota was observed after mussels were exposed to MPs for 1 week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and even after 8-day post-exposure depuration. Potential human pathogens were found among operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with increased abundance induced by MP-exposure. Faecal pellets containing microorganisms from altered gut microbiota and MPs might further influence microbiota of surrounding environment. Our results have demonstrated impacts of MP-exposure on mussel gut microbiota and suggested possible consequent effects on food quality, food safety, and the well-being of marine food web in the ecosystem for future studies. ?? 2020",

This study engaged citizen scientists to conduct shoreline marine debris surveys according to a published NOAA protocol within the Greater Farallones and Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuaries on the west coast of the United States. Here, we use the results of these multi-year monitoring data to estimate marine debris abundance and temporal trends, and identify drivers of debris loads. Changes in debris counts and composition are shown to reflect seasonal patterns of coastal upwelling and downwelling, but longer temporal trends in overall debris loads depend on the sampling window. Identifying drivers of stranded debris is challenging given the observational nature of the data. A linear increase in total expected debris counts was observed when up to five participants are conducting a survey, suggesting a need to standardize the number of participants and their search pattern for debris in shoreline monitoring efforts. Lastly, we discuss the application of shoreline marine debris data to evaluate the impact of management decisions and identify new targets for mitigation. ??

Here, we investigated how temporal changes in environmental factors affect the microbial communities formed on plastic (polyethylene terephthalate; PET) versus a ceramic substrate. In situ mesocosms (N = 90 replicates) were deployed at the sediment-water interface of a coastal lagoon and sampled every 4 weeks for 424 days. Sequencing data (16S rRNA) was parsed based on variation in temperature with the exposure starting in fall 2016 and remaining in situ through the next four seasons (winter, spring, summer and fall 2017). PET biofilms were distinct during the summer when salinity and temperature were highest. In particular, a significant shift in the relative abundance of Ignavibacteriales and Cytophagales was observed during the summer, but PET and ceramic communities were again indistinguishable the following fall. Water temperature, salinity and pH were significant drivers of PET biofilm diversity as well as the relative abundance of plastic-discriminant taxa. This study illustrates the temporal and successional dynamics of PET biofilms and clearly demonstrates that increased water temperature, salinity, pH and exposure length play a role in the formation of a plastic-specific microbial community, but this specificity can be lost with a change in environmental conditions. ??

There is limited information available about the response of immune cells to microplastics; the degree of uptake by the cells, the response of different organs or the impact of environmental concentrations of microplastic are matters that remain unclear. Moreover, very little is known about the toxicity of different polymer types. This study aimed to shed light on the physical impact of small microplastics (1?€?5 ??m) on cells from Atlantic salmon. Immune cells from intestine, blood, and head kidney were exposed to green fluorescent polyethylene microplastic (PE-MP), yellow fluorescent polystyrene microplastic (PS-MP) and both. High (50 mg/L), medium (5 mg/L), and low (0.05 mg/L) concentrations were tested for 1, 24, 48, and 72 h to study cell mortality and microplastic uptake. Quantitative data of microplastic uptake by fish immune cells were obtained for the first time by imaging flow cytometry. Salmon immune cells showed a relatively low ability to phagocytose microplastics. Less than 6% of the cells ingested the particles after 48 h of exposure to high concentrations. Cells also phagocytosed microplastics at low concentrations although at low rates (<0.1%). PE-MPs was phagocytosed by higher percentage of cells compared to PS-MPs and the former bioaccumulated in time while the latter decreased over time. However, each cell generally phagocytosed more PS-MPs particles than PE-MPs. Cells from different tissues showed different responses to the microplastic polymers. In conclusion, this study shows that immune cells of Atlantic salmon can phagocytose microplastics, and the impact is dependent on the microplastic type. PE-MPs, the most abundant polymer in the oceans and a widely used plastic in salmon aquaculture, was more easily taken up than PS-MPs. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how imaging flow cytometry can be applied in microplastics research. ?? Copyright ?? 2020 Abihssira-Garc??a, Park, Kiron and Olsvik.",

In this study, beach sand and surface water were sampled in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (APIS) in May and July 2018. Additional sand samples were collected at non-APIS beaches in western Lake Superior in May 2018. Microlitter particles (&lt;4 mm), consisting of microplastics and other low-density particles, were enumerated. Microplastics in sand samples, as identified by melt test, exhibited low abundances (0 to 55 particles/kg dry weight) and were mainly fibers. Microplastics in water samples were also low in abundance (9000 to 40,000 particles/km2) and were mostly fibers. Pyrolysis gas chromatography (pyGCMS) analysis was performed on a subset of microplastics from the sand and water samples. All particles with identifiable mass spectra were polyethylene. When beach sands were processed by density fractionation and filtration, the resulting microlitter samples also contained 260 to 2630 non-plastic particles per kg dry weight. A subset of these non-melting particles was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Results indicated that both organic and inorganic particles were included within non-plastic microlitter. Re-analysis of additional aliquots of the same sand samples using oxidation in addition to density fractionation reduced the number of non-plastic particles by roughly half, further highlighting that many of these were organic. Post-oxidation surface-water microlitter (333 ??m to 4 mm) also contained non-plastic low-density particles, which comprised 29 to 47% of the total microlitter particle counts. Based upon color distributions, non-plastic microlitter particles in sand and water samples include a small portion of particles identifiable as anthropogenic. The sources for many microlitter particles cannot be distinguished at present and may be natural in origin. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Mean abundance of MPs varies from 60 ?? 54 to 126.6 ?? 97 items/L in water and from 50 ?? 29 to 103.8 ?? 87 items/kg in sediment. Water and sediment samples from the Tuticorin islands contain higher MP concentrations than the Vembar islands. The highest MP were observed in the mainland samples, while MP distributions in the shoreward direction i.e. towards the islands closely reflect those of the mainland (p < 0.05). Polyethylene is the most common polymer, with fibers (1?€?3 mm) being the most abundant form in water and fragments (3?€?5 mm) being the most abundant in sediment. Pollution indices such as enrichment and contamination factors indicate moderate contamination of sediments by Zn, Hg, Cd, Pb and Ni. Heavy metal associated with MPs are greater than those in sediments, and this indicates that MP may be a source of metal pollution or that metals from the sediment preferentially partition to MPs. SEM analysis highlights the presence of cracks, protrusions and depositions on the surface of many MPs, indicating partial degradation. EDAX frequently showed the presence of Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni and Fe associated with MP surfaces. This study offers an insight into the level of MPs and associated elements that filter feeding corals in the region are exposed to current. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

A total of 14,261 plastic items, appertaining to 57 litter groups, were identified along the study area at different beach zones, i.e. at low tide water level (2%), along the foreshore (6%), at high tide water level (67%) and in the backshore area (25%). Plastic items have a great floatability, being this one of the main reasons for their proportional dominance among beach litter, especially in the wrack line. Hundreds of measurements were made of different items using Raman spectroscopy, an effective technique to determine the type of plastic. Cellulose acetate represented the most abundant material (79%) linked to cigarette butts, followed by polypropylene, 9% and polyethylene, 8%. The remaining were composed by polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl chloride. Smoke related items were the most common in the study area, followed by film and hard pieces, cotton bud sticks, fishing strings, food wrappers, caps/lids and single-use plastics. Beach litter can be related to beachgoers but some categories can be attributed to fishing activities or wastewater discharges. Plastics cause a multitude of damages to the coastal ecosystem, due to their toxic components and adsorbed substances and their facility of fragmentation and dispersion. Principal objective is the compositional characterization of plastic beach litter items and their spatial variability. It is therefore important to avoid unnecessary consumption, promote recycling and use other materials that are less harmful to the environment. ?? 2020",

After manufactured by plant-size equipment, the tensile strength, elongation rate and tearing strength of printed/non-printed fully-biodegradable packaging films were evaluated after eight-days testing under different weathering conditions including xenon-lamp aging, salt spraying, cooling and freezing, simulating the use of commercial fully-degradable bags in outdoor environment, ocean or coast environment, and in the ice chest of supermarkets. The results demonstrate that printing process led to a decrease of mechanical properties of the fully-biodegradable films. Moreover, the weathering tests had remarkable negative impact on the toughness of fully-biodegradable films, and had large impact on the tearing resistance of the films, while the strength of films were less influenced. Additionally, the low-temperature conditions show less influence on the mechanical properties of fully-biodegradable films, and the high salinity and high humidity environment exhibits tremendous impact on the fully-biodegradable films.

FVILAWW9,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140850,Rapid characterization of heavy metals in single microplastics by laser induced breakdown spectroscopy,"Microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environment usually carry hazardous matters, including toxic heavy metals. Quantification of heavy metals in MPs is crucial for the comprehensive understanding of their ecotoxicology in field environment. However, conventional methods for heavy metal determination either are applicable only to bulk/collective samples or require strict operation environment. Here we demonstrated that laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a robust tool for the characterization of heavy metals in single MPs. Single-particle LIBS selects individual MPs with specific sizes (down to tens of microns), shapes, and morphologies and analyzes simultaneously multiple elements in milliseconds without sample pretreatment. In addition to the elaborate optical design, we also used stretched thin polyethylene film as a substrate, which significantly suppress the matrix interference to the particles' spectra. The single particle LIBS was demonstrated to be a quantitative analytical method, and was applied to heavy metal analysis of the MPs collected in the seawaters of the Beibu Gulf of China. Positive correlation between the spectral intensities and the local marine pollutions as well as significant heterogeneity in the elemental compositions were observed. The results demonstrate that single-particle LIBS is a promising method for MPs characterization and is suitable for studying pollutant transportation by using MPs as vectors. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

However, whether such factors also affect the transportation of microplastics (MPs) in mangrove forests remains largely unknown. In our study, the extent to which the two most critical hydrodynamic factors (tidal range and current velocity) impact the distribution of MPs in mangrove sediments was evaluated. In the different zones of the mangrove forest, strong linear relationships were observed between the tidal current velocity and MPs content during both the flood and ebb tide periods (p = 0.002, R2 &gt; 0.837). Similarly, in the same mangrove forest, the MPs content significantly differed, and a general increasing trend was found from the seaward boundary (ranging from 80 ?? 16 item/kg to 1020 ?? 89 item/kg) to the landward boundary (ranging from 520 ?? 32 to 6040 ?? 114 item/kg). The MPs growth rates showed obvious linear relationships with the tidal current velocity (p &lt; 0.005, R2 &gt; 0.905), but there were no relationships with the tidal range (p = 0.717). The results of this work highlight that tidal current velocity and tidal range should be taken into account when exploring the mechanisms of MPs distributions in mangrove ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Microalgae, as the main phytoplankton and primary producers, usually co-exist with MPs. Despite previous studies that have proved the interaction of MPs and microalgae, it is largely unknown whether MPs can be uptake into cells of microalgae. In this study, both marine P. helgolandica var. tsingtaoensis and freshwater microalgae S. quadricauda were respectively exposed to 10 mg/L polystyrene microbeads with five diameter sizes: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 ??m. Confocal laser scanning and 3D image analysis showed that mean 24.0 % or 11.3 % cells of P. helgolandica var. tsingtaoensis contained 1.0 ??m or 2.0 ??m MPs after 72 h exposure. While mean 43.3 % or 15.3 % of S. quadricauda individuals engulfed 1.0 ??m or 2.0 ??m MPs within cells. But, none of 3.0?€?5.0 ??m MPs were observed within algal cells. These results demonstrate the size-dependent cellular internalization of MPs in microalgae. Exposure to 1.0?€?2.0 ??m PS MPs caused a significant reduction in the density of microalgae and influenced photosynthesis, which suggests cellular internalization of MPs can influence algal fertility and growth. This discovery first confirms cellular internalization of MPs in phytoplankton, of significance for the fate and eco-toxicity of MPs in the aquatic ecosystem. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
PZX8634P,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140420,Unraveling the Gordian Knot: Eight testable hypotheses on the effects of nutrient enrichment on tidal wetland sustainability,"The position of tidal wetlands at the land-sea interface makes them especially vulnerable to the effects of nutrient discharges and sea level rise (SLR). Experimental studies of coastal wetland nutrient additions report conflicting results among and within habitats, highlighting the importance of site-specific factors, and how spatial and temporal scaling modulates responses. This suite of influences as SLR accelerates creates a ?€?Gordian Knot?€? that may compromise coastal habitat integrity. We present eight testable hypotheses here to loosen this knot by identifying critical modulators about nutrient form, soil type and porosity, physiochemical gradients, and eco-evolutionary responses that may control the impacts of nutrient enrichment on coastal wetland sustainability: (1) the delivery and form of the nutrient shapes the ecosystem response; (2) soil type mediates the effects of nutrient enrichment on marshes; (3) belowground responses cannot be solely explained by phenotypic responses; (4) shifting zones of redox and salinity gradients modulate nutrient enrichment impacts; (5) eco-evolutionary processes can drive responses to nutrient availability; (6) nutrient enrichment leads to multiple changed ecosystem states; (7) biogeography trumps a plant's plastic responses to nutrient enrichment; and, (8) nutrient-enhanced wetlands are more susceptible to additional (and anticipated) anthropogenic changes. They provide a framework to investigate and integrate the urgently needed research to understand how excess nutrients threaten the sustainability of coastal wetlands, and wetlands in general. While there is no single ?€?right way?€? to test these hypotheses, including a combination of complex and simple, highly-replicated experiments is essential. ?? 2020 The Authors",

These are discarded and thrown away after their service life, causing soil and marine pollution. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate polyvinyl alcohol/carboxymethyl cellulose (PVA/CMC) based magnetic hydrogels prepared by physical crosslinking as an alternative for diabetic shoe inserts. Hydrogels prepared by moist heat treatment with different concentration of strontium ferrite nanoparticles (MG) are evaluated based on their structural, physico-chemical, morphological, thermal, mechanical, thermo-mechanical, swelling behavior, surface wetting, magnetic and rheological properties. It was observed that incorporation of MG resulted in improvement in overall properties. Infrared spectroscopy revealed strong hydrogen bonding interaction between CMC and PVA. The surface micrographs showed uniform dispersion of MG throughout PVA/CMC matrix. The results showed the improvement in flexibility and tensile strength of the PVA/CMC hydrogels with the incorporation of MG by 40 and 20%, respectively. Moreover, the magnetic hydrogels could absorb 300% moisture of their original weight which is necessary to avoid growth of microbes on skin. Thus, PVA/CMC/MG hydrogels can be considered as a biodegradable alternative for diabetic shoe insoles. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Future evolution could lead to deglaciation of the marine basins of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, depending on ongoing and future climate forcings, but also on basal topography/bathymetry, basal properties, and physical processes operating within the grounding zone. Hence, it is important to know the distribution of bed types of TG's interior and grounding zone, and to incorporate them accurately in models in order to improve estimates of retreat rates and stability. Here we estimate properties of the bed by determining its acoustic impedance from amplitude analysis of reflection seismic data. We report on the results from two lines ?€? a longitudinal (L-Line) and a transverse (N-Line) ?€? on a central flowline of TG ???100 km inland from the grounding zone. The data show considerable spatial variability in bed forms and properties, similar to results from a comparable survey farther inland. Notably, we find the same pattern here of hard (presumed bedrock) material on the stoss side of bumps and soft (presumed till) on the lee side. Physical understanding indicates the basal flow law describing motion over different regions of TG's bed likely varies from nearly-viscous over the bedrock regions to nearly-plastic over till regions, providing guidance for modeling. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Strains at fracture are obtained using digital image correlation analysis via DaVis LaVision software, and the corresponding states of stress are obtained via a plastic flow rule and a hardening relationship using the measured strains. The strain fields are calculated to the point of fracture initiation where the fracture initiation is defined as the condition when the first visible crack appears in the digital image of the test specimen. The software provides displacement and strain fields of the entire region and any specified sub-region of the imaged surface, which uses a so-called ?€?geometric mask?€?. The strain values are mask-size dependent due to the local nature of deformation before fracture. Therefore, in the current study, strain fields are obtained for various mask sizes to investigate the effect of mask size on failure strain, i.e., strain localization phenomena, with the minimum mask size chosen at roughly the limit of the continuum scale (O (100 ??m)). The evolution of the stress and strain fields as a function of loading is provided for different mask sizes. Moreover, comparison of the failure strain as mask sizes are decreased provides information on strain convergence. In this investigation, non-convergence behaviors are obtained for all experiments, as failure strain increased as the mask sizes are decreased. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Therefore, early detection of damage is of paramount importance. Vibration-based damage detection methods have been extensively studied in the past for damage detection in a vast variety of structural types, however, their application to risers has hardly been explored to date. In the limited existing literature of vibration-based damage detection in risers, the proposed methods have mostly been verified by numerical studies or by experimental models which lacked realistic representations of ambient excitations and similarity of the model to a full-scale structure. This paper presents, for the first time, experimental modelling of a top-tensioned riser at a laboratory scale for vibration-based damage detection studies, in which the similarity of the experimental model to a full-scale structure, the multifaceted effects of damage and the dynamic ambience are explicitly addressed. An experimental riser model is built and subjected to random wave loading in a flume according to the JONSWAP spectrum to simulate the ambient excitations realistically. The experimental model consists of a tensioned rod made of acetal plastic and several small lumped steel masses attached to the rod such that they reduce the natural frequencies of the model to the range of wave frequencies that can be generated in the flume. An analysis is conducted to account for the similarity between the experimental model and a full-scale structure with the priority given to the modal characteristics of the structures. Corrosion is considered as the cause of damage and it is simulated non-destructively on the experimental model by partial removal of the attached lumped mass at the assumed damage location and reduction of applied tension load. The amount of removed mass and reduced tension load are calculated such that the simulated damage on the experimental model is equivalent to an actual cross-sectional area loss due to corrosion damage in the full-scale structure. An application of a vibration-based damage detection method is demonstrated using experimental data obtained for several different damage scenarios. An auto-regressive (AR) model is fitted to the acceleration response of the riser and coefficients of the AR model are used as the damage sensitive features (DSFs). Damage detection is achieved by conducting outlier analysis on the DSFs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
YMUBN3SJ,10.5194/npg-27-501-2020,Detecting flow features in scarce trajectory data using networks derived from symbolic itineraries: An application to surface drifters in the North Atlantic,"The basin-wide surface transport of tracers such as heat, nutrients and plastic in the North Atlantic Ocean is organized into large-scale flow structures such as the Western Boundary Current and the Subtropical and Subpolar gyres. Being able to identify these features from drifter data is important for studying tracer dispersal but also for detecting changes in the large-scale surface flow due to climate change. We propose a new and conceptually simple method to detect groups of trajectories with similar dynamical behaviour from drifter data using network theory and normalized cut spectral clustering. Our network is constructed from conditional bin-drifter probability distributions and naturally handles drifter trajectories with data gaps and different lifetimes. The eigenvalue problem of the respective Laplacian can be replaced by a singular value decomposition of a related sparse data matrix. The construction of this matrix scales with O.NM CN /, where N is the number of particles, M the number of bins and the number of time steps. The concept behind our network construction is rooted in a particle s symbolic itinerary derived from its trajectory and a state space partition, which we incorporate in its most basic form by replacing a particle s itinerary by a probability distribution over symbols. We represent these distributions as the links of a bipartite graph, connecting particles and symbols.We apply our method to the periodically driven double-gyre flow and successfully identify well-known features. Exploiting the duality between particles and symbols defined by the bipartite graph, we demonstrate how a direct low-dimensional coarse definition of the clustering problem can still lead to relatively accurate results for the most dominant structures and resolve features down to scales much below the coarse graining scale. Our method also performs well in detecting structures with incomplete trajectory data, which we demonstrate for the double-gyre flow by randomly removing data points.We finally apply our method to a set of ocean drifter trajectories and present the first network-based clustering of the North Atlantic surface transport based on surface drifters, successfully detecting well-known regions such as the Subpolar and Subtropical gyres, the Western Boundary Current region and the Caribbean Sea. ?? 2020 Mary Ann Liebert Inc..

This study aims to estimate the weight of potential plastic waste at the estuary before it enters the ocean and becomes marine debris. Several parameters are developed based on three main aspects, which are environment as graded by LULC, social aspect as provided by population density using building data, and economic aspect as provided by nightlight from NOAA's VIIRS. The estimation used raster-based digital numbers processing, by using estimated data and providing weight. As a result, it shows that most of the metropolitan cities such as Jakarta contribute almost 507 tonne of plastic waste per day. For other cities, its generation is directly proportional to the increase in population.

In contrast to marine environments, the analysis of plastic debris, including microplastics (particles <5 mm in maximum diameter), in freshwater systems is limited, and even fewer studies have examined microplastics in riverine sediments. Nonetheless, it has become clear that microplastics are now a ubiquitous component of riverine ecosystems and their distribution is dependent on anthropogenic inputs and the physical and chemical processes that control their transport, transformation, and deposition along the drainage network. In many ways, the transport and fate of microplastics will parallel that of other particulate matter that has been extensively studied for at least the last 50 years.

The attached substances were mainly natural materials, but 28% of the total substances were plastics. There was a similar physical-chemical composition of the attached MPs in the two regions suggesting a similar origin. Leaves, regardless of plant species, can indiscriminately retain atmospheric MPs. About 0.13 trillion pieces of MPs are estimated to be attached to leaf surfaces in the top 11 green countries.

This study aims at investigating the ingestion and the effects induced by 7-days dietary exposure to environmentally relevant amount (8, 80 and 800 particles/g of food) of irregular shaped and sized (diameter 12.6???1,065 ??m; mean diameter 316 ?? 12 ??m) polyethylene terephthalate microplastics (PET-MPs) on a common marine benthic grazer, the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Adverse effects were investigated on digestive tract at biochemical (oxidative stress biomarkers) and tissue level (histopathological analyses). Potential alteration of MP structure/surface and PET macromolecules due to the ingestion of PET-MPs within the sea urchin digestive tract were investigated. Results showed that PET-MPs were efficiently egested by sea urchins without producing histological alterations on digestive tract tissues, only inducing a slight modulation of oxidative status. Sea urchin grazing activity and the related transit of PET-MPs within animal digestive tract slightly affected MP structure and PET composition. These findings suggest that PET-MPs might represent an hazard for benthic grazer organisms, which can partially contribute to the degradation of PET in marine ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

In this article, we report the hazardous nature and cancer risk of microplastics which originate from e-waste. Capture of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) onto microplastics by adsorption phenomena and an assessment of probable cancer risk of ingested PAHs enriched microplastics by human beings have been investigated. The adsorption equilibrium was well fit for the Freundlich isotherm model. The adsorption capacity of carcinogenic PAHs on microplastics was ranged from 46 to 236 ??g g???1 and the maximum binding was achieved within 45 min in water. The leachate derived from microplastics of e-waste were highly hazardous in nature, for example, the sum of PAHs was 3.17 mg L???1 which is about 1000 times higher than the standard for benzo[a]pyrene, a congener of PAHs. The calculated cancer risk in terms of lifetime of microplastic ingestion would be 1.13 ?? 10???5 for children and 1.28 ?? 10???5 for adults and these values are higher than the recommended value of 106. The abundance of microplastics could transfer hazardous pollutants to seafood (e.g., fishes and prawns) leading to cancer risk in human beings. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
LHXRJHNE,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122909,Microplastics aggravate the adverse effects of BDE-47 on physiological and defense performance in mussels,"The highly hydrophobic surfaces make microplastics a potential carrier of organic pollutants in the marine environment. In order to explore the toxic effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-47) combined with microplastics on marine organisms, we exposed the marine mussel Mytilus coruscus to micro-PS combined with BDE-47 for 21 days to determine the immune defense, oxidative stress and energy metabolism of the mussels. The results showed that the clearance rate (CR) of mussels exposed to single micro-PS, single BDE-47 or both was lower than control group. In general, compared to single BDE-47 exposure, the combination of micro-PS and BDE-47 significantly increased respiration rate (RR), activities of acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, but significantly decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and the relative expression of heat shock protein (Hsp70 and 90). Overall, combined stress has more adverse effects on defense performance and energy metabolism in mussels and micro-PS seem to exacerbate the toxicological effects of BDE-47. As microplastics pollution may deteriorate in the future, the health of mussels may be threatened in organically polluted environment, which eventually change the stability of the structure and function of intertidal ecosystem. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

In particular, the role of the Agulhas Current and local wind drift has not been fully elucidated as drivers for connecting coastal and offshore waters, and the results of a previous study that modelled the movements of plastic nurdles following a spill in Durban Harbour are used to infer dispersal and transport. Planktonic fish eggs and early stage larvae are passive and behave in a similar way to nurdles, and the rapid movement of the nurdles provided a unique opportunity to track coastal dispersal trajectories and provide insights into population connectivity in some migratory fish species. Under the variable wind conditions typical along the coast, the nurdles tended to remain localised but when winds blew consistently for a few days in one direction, the nurdles drifted from localised surrogate spawning areas and moved via Agulhas Current connectivity and onshore wind assistance to distal coastal locations hundreds of kilometres away. The rapid and extensive dispersal of nurdles served as a valuable surrogate for understanding dispersal dynamics of planktonic organisms in the surface layer of the ocean which has important implications for genetic dispersal in fishes. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Here, we document directional hemispherical reflectance measurements of anthropogenic and natural materials gathered along the shorelines of the Chilo?? Archipelago, Chile. These spectral observations were completed in a Chilean laboratory using a state-of-the-art hyperspectral HyLogger-3TM thermal infrared (TIR) spectrometer starting from the medium-wave infrared spectrum (6 um) and going to the longwave infrared (14.5 um) spectrum at 0.025 um intervals. The samples we investigated included sands, shells, algae, nautical ropes, Styrofoam , gunny sacks and several fragments of plastic-based items. The apparent visible colours of these samples included shades of black, blue, brown, green, orange, white and yellow. We grouped the samples using robust statistical approaches (derivatives, peak-seeking technique) and visual analyses of the derived hyperspectral reflectances. In each group we derived an average or TIR end-member signal and determined diagnostic wavebands. Most of the diagnostic wavebands picked were found to be inside the atmospheric window of the TIR spectrum region. Furthermore, this laboratory reference dataset and findings might become useful in related field observations using similar thermal infrared technologies, especially in identifying anomalies resulting from environmental and meteorological perturbations. Validation and verification of proposed diagnostic wavebands would be part of a continuing effort to advance TIR remote sensing knowledge as well as support robust detection algorithm development to potentially distinguish plastics in litter throughout the natural environments.

Data suggested variation between species with a higher concentration of microplastics for S. sagax (mean of 1.58 items individual?€?1) compared to Et. whiteheadi (1.38 items individual?€?1) and En. encrasicolus (1.13 items individual?€?1). The occurrence of microplastics was also higher for S. sagax (72%) and Et. whiteheadi (72%) compared to En. encrasicolus (57%). Microfibers accounted for 80% of ingested microplastics (the remainder were plastic fragments) with the main ingested polymers being poly(ethylene:propylene:diene) (33% occurrence), polyethylene (20%), polyamide (20%), polyester (20%), and polypropylene (7%). The abundance of ingested items was not significantly correlated with fish caudal length or body weight, and spatial investigation indicated an increase in the abundance of ingested items from the West to the South coast. Etrumeus whiteheadi is proposed as a bio-indicator for microplastics for South Africa. ??

YQL4HJNT,10.1021/acs.est.0c03441,High Abundances of Microplastic Pollution in Deep-Sea Sediments: Evidence from Antarctica and the Southern Ocean,"Plastic pollution in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean has been recorded in scientific literature since the 1980s; however, the presence of microplastic particles (<5 mm) is less understood. Here, we aimed to determine whether microplastic accumulation would vary among Antarctic and Southern Ocean regions through studying 30 deep-sea sediment cores. Additionally, we aimed to highlight whether microplastic accumulation was related to sample depth or the sediment characteristics within each core. Sediment cores were digested and separated using a high-density sodium polytungstate solution (SPT) and microplastic particles were identified using micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (??FTIR). Microplastic pollution was found in 93% of the sediment cores (28/30). The mean (??SE) microplastics per gram of sediment was 1.30 ?? 0.51, 1.09 ?? 0.22, and 1.04 ?? 0.39 MP/g, for the Antarctic Peninsula, South Sandwich Islands, and South Georgia, respectively. Microplastic fragment accumulation correlated significantly with the percentage of clay within cores, suggesting that microplastics have similar dispersion behavior to low density sediments. Although no difference in microplastic abundance was found among regions, the values were much higher in comparison to less remote ecosystems, suggesting that the Antarctic and Southern Ocean deep-sea accumulates higher numbers of microplastic pollution than previously expected. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

Charcoal production and use, including plastic burning to initiate combustion, release large quantities of trace gases and particles that impact air quality and climate. Here, we develop an inventory of current (2014) and future (2030) emissions from the charcoal supply chain in Africa that we implement in the GEOS-Chem model to quantify the contribution of charcoal to surface concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone and direct radiative forcing due to aerosols and ozone. We estimate that the charcoal industry in 2014 required 140-460 Tg of biomass and 260 tonnes of plastic and that industry emissions could double by 2030, so that methane emissions from the charcoal industry could outcompete those from open fires by 2025. In 2014, the largest enhancements in PM2.5 (0.5-1.4 ??g m-3) and ozone (0.4-0.7 ppbv) occur around the densely populated cities in East and West Africa. Cooling due to aerosols (-100 to -300 mW m-2) is concentrated over dense cities, whereas warming due to ozone is widespread, peaking at 4.2 mW m-2 over the Atlantic Ocean. These effects will worsen with ongoing dependence on this energy source, spurred by rapid urbanization and absence of viable cleaner alternatives. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",
WXHLCXTD,10.3390/su12229543,Microplastic contamination of three commonly consumed seafood species from Taiwan: A pilot study,"Microplastics have already been detected in various human foods, especially seafood. This problem should be especially pertinent to the Taiwanese public because a relatively high proportion of people?€?s diet comes from seafood. Therefore, a pilot study of microplastic contamination of seafood products commonly consumed by Taiwanese people is presented. Six batches of three seafood species were examined for the presence of microplastics using FTIR spectroscopy. A total of 107 seafood individuals from three species (hard clam Meretrix lusoria, oyster Crassostrea gigas, Loligo squid Loliginidae spp.) weighing a total of 994 g yielded a total of 100 microplastic particles consisting of nine different polymer types. The most common polymer types were polypropylene, poly(ethylene:propylene:diene), and polyethylene terephthalate; we also detected six additional, but less common polymer types. A total of 91% of microplastic particles were fragments that likely originated from fragmented plastic debris which was then consumed by the seafood species; the remaining particles were fibers and a pellet. The mean number of microplastics kg???1 was 87.9 microplastics kg???1 across the three examined species. Given that the Taiwanese public average about 10 kg of seafood consumption per year, a few thousand microplastic particles are estimated to be annually consumed on average. The methodology of this pilot study can now be used to conduct examinations of more seafood species and samples. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

It assumes higher relevance in the packaging industry because of the growing plastics demand, the increasing awareness of consumers on single-use-products, the low recyclability performance and last but not least, the challenge of urban littering and microplastics dispersion in marine ecosystem. This paper presents the case of a small-medium enterprise that implemented a decision-making process to rethink the design of frozen food packaging in accordance with systemic and life cycle thinking. Eco-design and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been simultaneously used to test and validate the redesign process, thus fostering the substitution of the plastic ?€?open and close?€? cap with a closing method entirely made of cardboard. Results shows how using an integrated decision-making system at the design stage have allowed to get up many benefits at multiple levels, including sustainable and safe supply chain, efficient logistic operations, better recyclability, and lower energy consumption. Moreover, even if it cannot be assessed by the existing tools, the solution provides a strong contribution to the reduction in the consumption of plastics and the prevention of marine pollution. ?? 2020 by the authors.

N6PKX388,10.3390/ma13225065,Fibre-reinforced composite for protection against shark bites,"The number of shark attacks resulting in fatalities and severe injuries has increased steadily over recent years. This is mainly attributed to a growing population participating in ocean sports such as swimming, diving, and surfing. To mitigate the severity of shark attacks, the current study presents a novel fibre-reinforced composite for bite protection. This material is intended for integration into neoprene wetsuits, e.g., in the form of protective pads. A suitable material must be able to withstand significant bite forces, which are concentrated within a small contact area at the tips of the shark teeth. At the same time, the material should not hinder the complex motion sequences of aquatic sports. To this end, a novel fibre-reinforced composite was created by integrating Kevlar fibres into an elastic matrix. Uni-axial testing using shark teeth replicas was conducted on a specially designed test rig to quantify the effectiveness of the novel protective material. ?? MDPI AG. All rights reserved.",

These materials are anisotropic and inhomogeneous materials. It is having unique properties in which the strength-to-weight ratio is high. Basically there are three types of composite materials. They are polymer-matrix composites, metal-matrix composites and ceramic-matrix composites. They are widely used in numerous engineering applications. These materials are widely used in variety of markets, including aerospace, architecture, automotive, energy, infrastructure, marine, military, sports and recreation. Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) consists of at least two constituents, one being a metal necessarily, the other material may be a different metal or another material, such as a ceramic or organic compound. Hardness is a measure of resistance to localized plastic deformation induced by either mechanical indentation or abrasion. Wear is the damaging, gradual removal or deformation of material at solid surfaces. In this research paper the hardness and wear behaviour of aluminium composites (Al6061) reinforced with Tungsten Carbide (WC) was investigated. The results revealed that, the hardness of composite increases with increase in the percentage of tungsten carbide particles. The wear resistance of the composite also increases with increase in tungsten carbide particle weight fraction. ?? 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.",

Small plastic particles in the microscale and nanoscale ranges have been found in all marine ecosystems, but little is known about their effects upon marine organisms. In this study, we examine changes in cell growth, aggregation, and gene expression of two symbiotic dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, Symbiodinium tridacnidorum (clade A3), and Cladocopium sp. (clade C) under exposure to 42-nm polystyrene beads. In laboratory experiments, the cell number and aggregation were reduced after 10 days of nanoplastic exposure at 0.01, 0.1, and 10 mg/L concentrations, but no clear correlation with plastic concentration was observed. Genes involved in dynein motor function were upregulated when compared to control conditions, while genes related to photosynthesis, mitosis, and intracellular degradation were downregulated. Overall, nanoplastic exposure led to more genes being downregulated than upregulated and the number of genes with altered expression was larger in Cladocopium sp. than in S. tridacnidorum, suggesting different sensitivity to nano-plastics between species. Our data show that nano-plastic inhibits growth and alters aggregation properties of microalgae, which may negatively affect the uptake of these indispensable symbionts by coral reef organisms. ?? 2020 by the authors.

659J76JB,10.1088/1748-9326/abbb4f,A spatially variable scarcity of floating microplastics in the eastern North Pacific Ocean,"Plastic waste accumulating in the global ocean is an increasingly threatening environmental issue. To date, the floating and thus most visible fraction of ocean plastic pollution has been mapped at global scale. Yet, large knowledge gaps exist in our current understanding of the transport and transformation processes of positively buoyant plastic debris at the sea surface. Observations at sea typically report an apparent scarcity of microplastics (<5 mm) relative to the expected abundance-size distribution based on fragmentation of larger plastic objects. Here, we provide a comprehensive study on the relative abundance of microplastics (>500 ??m) and mesoplastics (0.5-5 cm) in the surface waters of the eastern North Pacific Ocean using data from 1136 040 plastic fragments collected by 679 neuston trawl deployments between 2015 and 2019. Our results reveal that the apparent microplastic scarcity is not uniformly distributed across the region. Instead, we show that the relative abundance of floating microplastics increases from the outside to the inside of the North Pacific Garbage Patch. We hypothesize that this observation could be explained by (i) a spatially variable microplastic removal due to spatial differences in ocean productivity, (ii) a differential dispersal of micro- vs. mesoplastics with a preferential accumulation of microplastics in the subtropical gyre, and/or (iii) the timescales associated with transport and fragmentation of plastic objects at the ocean surface with older, more degraded, floating plastic accumulation in subtropical gyres. The results presented here highlight that global estimates of the accumulation and removal of positively buoyant microplastics need to consider spatial aspects such as variations in ocean productivity, the dominant physical transport processes in a given area, as well as the time needed for a plastic object to reach the specific offshore location. ?? 2020 The Author(s).

This review summarizes the results of experimental research on the effects of plastic on different groups of soil animals (21 studies) and soil animals on plastic in the soil (13 studies). The presence of microplastic in soil has a negative influence on nematodes, collembolans, pot worms, and earthworms. The mechanisms of this influence often involve damage or dysfunction of the digestive system. On the other hand, soil animals can contribute to the mechanical degradation of plastics and stimulate their microbial degradation in soil.

The quantification of microplastics in natural habitats and the characterization of their potential effects in marine wild organisms is currently of high importance. The main objective of this work was to investigate the fate and the effects of a microplastic mixture (ratio of 1: polyethylene (PE), 1: polypropylene (PP)) in the wedge clam Donax trunculus. The assimilation kinetics of microplastics particles was assessed in different organs (gills, digestive gland and flesh) using three different protocols (direct observation, H2O2, and HNO3/HCl digestion) in order to compare method's efficacity. The main biological endpoints studied were Aceylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition as a neurotoxicity biomarker, the Catalase (CAT) enzymatic activity and the Gluthation-S-Transfereases (GSTs) activities as oxidative stress and phase II detoxification phase markers, respectively. Results showed that the H2O2 digestion method was more efficient to assess particles assimilation than the direct observation and acid digestion. In all cases no particles were detected in clam's flesh and gills were the first target organ for micro-plastics accumulation. The exposure of Donax truculus to PP/PE mixture (0.06 g/Kg of sand) induce a significant inhibition of AChE activity in both gills and digestive gland and oxidative stress in all organs studied.

The current study aimed to assess the occurrence of MPs in the sediments of the Caspian Sea southern coasts. For sampling, two distinct areas were selected including recreational-tourism areas (No = 24), and non-tourist areas (No = 24). MPs were studied in 5 and 5-15 cm from the top sediment surface. All 96 samples were taken and analyzed according to the methodology provided by the US national oceanic and atmospheric administration (NOAA). The combination of observational techniques, FTIR, and SEM analysis was applied to identify MPs. MPs were classified into two categories in terms of size: small MPs and large MPs. The average, maximum, and minimum abundance of MPs (based on dry weight) in sediments of the southern coast of the Caspian Sea was 183.5 ?? 154.4 MP/kg, 542 MP/kg, and 13 MP/kg, respectively. On the basis of morphology, fragment-shaped (30.3%) MPs showed the highest prevalence, while film-shaped (18.7%) MPs were the least contributory. Polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), each of them with a 20% share, were the most common MPs found in the studied samples. The distribution of MPs on the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea revealed a sporadic and irregular spatial pattern. Correspondingly, it can be concluded that probably environmental factors (the current of the sea surface water from west to east), enclosed environment of the Caspian Sea, anthropogenic activities (e.g., industrialization and urbanization, improper waste management, fishing, and tourism activity, residential wastewater), and also discharging of rivers (which can carry plastics) into the sea, have all influenced the abundance and polymer diversity of MPs in the sediments of the southern coast of the sea.

Microplastic particles were found in all samples, with abundances ranging from 0.1 to 7 particles/m3. Polymers identified were principally acrylics, PET, and cellophane. The average abundance of microplastics in surface waters was similar along the whole estuary (0.4 ?? 0.3 particles/m3) with acrylics and epoxy resins being more abundant near Caleta Tortel, the only small village in the area. The observed higher abundance of microplastics in the deeper waters towards the Gulf of Penas points to intrusions of subsurface waters transporting plastic particles from the ocean into the channel system. This underlines the potential of ocean currents in transporting plastic pollution into pristine fjords and channels in Chilean Patagonia. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

However, there are limited data on microplastics distribution patterns in various tissues of marine organisms. Microplastics in seawater and nine types of tissues of the Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri) from three coastal aquaculture areas were analysed. The results showed that in seawater, microplastics were mainly fibrous. There were no significant differences in microplastics abundance among the three areas. The concentrations of microplastics in the scallop anus, intestinal tract and kidney were substantially higher than those in the other tissues. Microplastics abundance ranged from 8 to 13 particles per scallop. Microplastics colours were mainly black, transparent and blue, and there were no significant tissue distribution patterns. Microplastics size ranged from 5 ??m to 1 mm. The microplastics abundance in the haemolymph was significantly correlated with those of the surrounding seawater.

Here, microplastic particles were sampled in Hangzhou Bay, which is heavily influenced by a range of human activities, and their abundance, size, and polymer type characterised. The abundance of microplastics was 0.14 ?? 0.12 items/m3 in water, 84.3 ?? 56.6 items/kg dry weight of sediment, and between 0.25 ?? 0.14 and 1.4 ?? 0.37 items/individual in biota. These results show that Hangzhou Bay has a low level of microplastic contamination compared to other coastal systems in China, although abundance was spatially variable within the bay; relatively higher microplastic abundances were found in the southern area of the bay, which has adjacent industrial and urban land-use zones, while lower abundances were observed in the central and northern bay areas where mariculture, fisheries, and mineral and energy industries are most common. The relatively low microplastic abundance observed in the biota samples is consistent with the generally low values for the seawater and sediment samples. Pellets were the most common of four particle-shape classes (fibres, fragments, films, and pellets) in surface seawater, while fibres were most abundant in sediment and biota. Smaller-sized microplastics (&lt;1.0 mm) were dominant in all samples. Microplastics in the surface seawater were dominated by low-density polypropylene and polyethylene particles, while rayon was dominant in the sediment and biota samples.

This study quantified MPs down to 10 ??m in marine waters of the most populated region in Greenland. A new plastic-free pump-filter system was used to collect MPs from surface waters in the fjord Nuup Kangerlua close to Nuuk. Additionally, we took samples by horizontal tows with a bongo net (300 ??m mesh-size). The median concentrations were 142 MPs m???3 and 0.12 MPs m???3 in the pump and bongo samples, respectively. The most abundant polymer was polyester across stations and sampling types. Fibers were the dominant shape in the bongo samples, while non-fibrous particles dominated in the pump samples. MP abundance was lower in the fjord and increased close to Nuuk and towards the open ocean, indicating that Nuuk is an important point source for MPs. In both samples, concentrations of MPs increased with decreasing size, illustrating the importance of quantifying the smallest fraction of MPs. Thus, the use of methods allowing for a quantification of the smallest MPs is vital to reduce the underestimation of MP concentrations in the environment. The smallest size fraction is also most available to plankton-feeding marine invertebrates and an important entry point for MPs into marine food webs. At the found concentrations, immediate adverse effects on the pelagic food webs are unlikely. However, growing anthropogenic activities could increase the risk of MPs to affect the sensitive Arctic ecosystem. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Sampling of microplastics >10 ??m in West Greenland with a new pump system demonstrated the dominance of the smallest size fraction, which is the most likely to enter pelagic marine food webs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

We examine a large flooding event which happened in the northeastern part of the Black Sea in October 2018. A high resolution circulation model coupled with a Lagrangian particle model is applied to simulate transport of riverine FML in the coastal sea. During this flood multiple river plumes in the study area coalesced into one stripe of freshened water which occupied large segment of coastal sea along the shoreline. Riverine FML was transported within this stripe far off its sources in river mouths and remained arrested near the shore. As a result, approximately half of the discharged FML was washed ashore by the Stokes drift. FML, which remained in the sea, accumulated at convergence lines associated with large salinity gradients at the fronts between the river plumes and the ambient sea. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

While MPs have been extensively studied, the toxicity of their smaller counterpart, nanoplastics (NPs), is not well documented. Despite likely large-scale human and animal exposure to NPs, the associated health risks remain unclear, especially during early developmental stages. To address this, we investigated the health impacts of exposures to both 50 and 200 nm polystyrene NPs in larval zebrafish. From 6 to 120 h post-fertilization (hpf), developing zebrafish were exposed to a range of fluorescent NPs (10-10,000 parts per billion). Dose-dependent increases in accumulation were identified in exposed larval fish, potentially coinciding with an altered behavioral response as evidenced through swimming hyperactivity. Notably, exposures did not impact mortality, hatching rate, or deformities; however, transcriptomic analysis suggests neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction at both high and low concentrations. Furthermore, results of this study suggest that NPs can accumulate in the tissues of larval zebrafish, alter their transcriptome, and affect behavior and physiology, potentially decreasing organismal fitness in contaminated ecosystems. The uniquely broad scale of this study during a critical window of development provides crucial multidimensional characterization of NP impacts on human and animal health. ?? 2020 The results of this study suggest that NPs can accumulate in the tissues of larval zebrafish, alter their transcriptome, and affect behavior and physiology, potentially decreasing organismal fitness in contaminated ecosystems. ?? 2020",

The accumulation of microplastics (MPs) in the oceans has notable ecological implications due to their long persistence, their potential ecotoxicity, and their ability to adsorb other pollutants and act as vectors of pathogens. Nevertheless, whereas the number of investigations documenting the presence of MPs in wild fish has increased, less studies have addressed the toxicological effects associated with the ingestion of MPs in long-term laboratory conditions. The aim of the present study was to assess the physiological response of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) exposed to low-density polyethylene (LDPE) MPs during a 90-day exposure followed by an extra 30 days of depuration through the application of oxidative stress biomarkers in the gut. No changes were observed in the Fulton condition factor of fish associated with MP intake. The activities of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione s-transferase and the levels of reduced glutathione progressively increased throughout the study in the MPs-fed group compared to the control group, reaching the highest values at 90 days. Similarly, the activity of the pro-inflammatory enzyme, myeloperoxidase, and the levels of oxidative damage markers -malondialdehyde and protein carbonyls-also increased after 90 days of exposure to an enriched diet with MPs. During the 30-day depuration period, all the biomarkers analysed tended to normalize, with the majority recovering values similar to those of the control group.

Microplastic pollution in the soil environment has thus begun to elicit great concern. This review summarizes the observed effects of microplastic pollution on soil ecosystems as well as sorption and transport behaviors of microplastics in such environments. Microplastic pollution has been detected in various soils including agricultural/farmland, greenhouse, home garden, coastal, industrial, and floodplain soils. Microplastics affect soil physical and chemical properties, microbial and enzyme activities, and plant growth, and also pose adverse ecotoxicological effects to soil fauna. These effects depend on the concentration, size, and shape of microplastics, as well as soil texture. Microplastics are known to sorb organic and inorganic pollutants, possibly affecting the distribution of these substances in soil. Existing evidence demonstrates the negligible effect of microplastics on bioaccumulation of contaminants in soil fauna. The horizontal and vertical transport of microplastics can be facilitated by soil fauna. Pollutants associated with microplastics may disperse further following the transport of microplastics in soil. This review also highlights perspectives for future research on microplastics in soil.

Although plastic contamination is well documented in the aquatic fauna of the oceans and large rivers of the world, there are few data on the organisms of headwater streams, especially in tropical regions. In the present study, we evaluated the contamination of small fish by plastics in Amazonian streams. For this, we evaluated the shape and size, and the abundance of plastics in the gastrointestinal tracts and gills of 14 fish species from 12 streams in eastern Brazilian Amazon. We used a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to compare the levels of contamination among species and between organs. Only one individual of the 68 evaluated (a small catfish Mastiglanis cf. asopos) contained no plastic particles, and no difference was found in the contamination of the gills and digestive tract. However, Hemigrammus unilineatus presented less contamination of both the gills and the digestive tract than the other species, while Polycentrus schomburgkii had less plastic in the gastrointestinal tract, whereas Crenicichla regani and Pimelodella gerii both had a larger quantity of plastic adhered to their gills in comparison with the other species. Nanoplastics and microplastics adhered most to the gills, while plastic fibers were the most common type of material overall. This is the first study to analyze plastic contamination in fish from Amazonian streams, and in addition to revealing high levels of contamination, some species were shown to possibly be more susceptible than others. This reinforces the need for further, more systematic research into the biological and behavioral factors that may contribute to the greater vulnerability of some fish species to contamination by plastics.

Indiscriminate disposal of the effluent and untreated wastewater not only contribute to accumulation of MP in the marine environment, but they can also act as a carrier for various hydrophobic compounds and contributors of pollutants that leach from them via natural degradation. In this assessment, we have summarized the MP concentrations in influent and effluent streams, and provide quantification of the discharges from these WWTPs. Almost 50% of the global wastewater influent of 3,562,082 ?? 105 m3 remains untreated. Some conservative estimates indicate that treated effluent disposal can add around 1.47 ?? 1015 MPs annually, whereas the discharge of untreated effluent is likely to add a staggering 3.85 ?? 1016 MPs annually to the aquatic environments. The efficiency of MP removal in wastewater treatment plants varies between 88 and 99.9%, indicating the potential of capturing the majority of the MP from escaping into the freshwater and marine environment. Based on WWTP removal efficiencies for MPs, calculations suggest that if all the globally produced wastewater was treated prior to release, a reduction of over 90% of the current amount of MP inputs into the aquatic environment could be achieved. From the number of studies conducted and assessments made on MPs in waste streams, it is obvious the methodologies followed were quite different, and the use of acids and heating are likely to deteriorate the MPs, emphasizing the need to develop harmonized protocols for microplastic assessment in wastewater treatment plants. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Heteroaggregation with metal-based nanoparticles (e.g., CeO2-NPs) is critical to the environmental mobility of nanoplastics, as they are likely to be jointly emitted to the aquatic environment. Here, time-resolved dynamic light scattering was employed to evaluate the influence of CeO2-NPs on the aggregation kinetics of differentially surface functionalized polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) in various water types. Natural organic matters and ionic strength were dominating factors influencing the heteroaggregation of PS-NPs and CeO2-NPs in surface waters. The critical coagulation concentrations of PS-NPs were dependent on their surface coatings, which decreased in the presence of CeO2-NPs due to electrostatic attraction and/or specific adsorption. Incubation of PS-NPs and CeO2-NPs under different pH confirmed the importance of electrostatic force in the aggregation of PS NPs. A relatively low humic acid (HA) concentration promoted the heteroaggregation of NH2-coated PS-NPs and CeO2-NPs because the introduction of a HA surface coating decreased the electrostatic hindrance. At high HA concentrations, the aggregation was inhibited by steric repulsion. The combined effects of high efficiency of double layer compression, bridging and complexation contributed to the high capacity of Ca2+ in destabilizing the particles. These findings demonstrate that the environmental behavior of nanoplastics is influenced by the presence of other non-plastic particles and improve our understanding of the interactions between PS-NPs and CeO2-NPs in complex and realistic aqueous environments. ?? 2020",

This work aims to assess the levels of MPs in the waters of an urban lagoon (Bizerte lagoon, northern Tunisia) and to study the effects of environmental factors on their distribution and abundance. Average concentration of total MPs was found to be 453.0 ?? 335.2 items m???3. The upper 25 cm water layer of the lagoon is most likely to contain 16.99 ?? 109 MPs items (which correspond to a total mass of 42.47 t). Fibers were the primary MPs types encountered, and most of MPs particles identified were white and clear-colored. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the predominant polymer types in Bizerte lagoon. Among the various potential plastic sources of MPs, unmanaged domestic plastic wastes are likely to be the major source of plastic pollution in the lagoon. Several environmental factors appeared to influence the distribution and density of MPs in the lagoon waters. These information contribute to better understand the dynamics of MPs in lagoons and to develop environmental management actions. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

To address this knowledge gap, we combined enrichment experiments employing low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as the sole carbon source with a comparison of bacterial communities on plastic debris in the Pacific, the North Atlantic and the northern Adriatic Sea. A total of 35 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were enriched in the LDPE-laboratory incubations after 1 year, of which 20 were present with relative abundances > 0.5% in at least one plastic sample collected from the environment. From these, OTUs classified as Cognatiyoonia, Psychrobacter, Roseovarius and Roseobacter were found in the communities of plastics collected at all oceanic sites. Additionally, OTUs classified as Roseobacter, Pseudophaeobacter, Phaeobacter, Marinovum and Cognatiyoonia, also enriched in the LDPE-laboratory incubations, were enriched on LDPE communities compared to the ones associated to glass and polypropylene in in-situ incubations in the northern Adriatic Sea after 1 month of incubation. Some of these enriched OTUs were also related to known alkane and hydrocarbon degraders. Collectively, these results demonstrate that there are prokaryotes capable of surviving with LDPE as the sole carbon source living on plastics in relatively high abundances in different water masses of the global ocean. ?? 2020 The Authors.

While most efforts have focused on assessing ecological impacts, information on the socio-economic dimension of marine litter is scarce. Here we provide a detailed assessment of the direct economic costs of marine litter for a remote region of the North-East Atlantic, the Azores archipelago. Face-to-face interviews were performed to quantify and characterise the costs of marine litter-related incidents and coastal clean-ups to 259 sea-users and 21 local authorities, respectively. Overall, marine litter pollution was estimated to cost a total of ???710,698 (??195,181, SD) per year, which is the equivalent to 0.02% of the Gross Domestic Product of the Azores archipelago. Our results demonstrate that marine litter creates costs and inconveniences for a range of stakeholders engaged in marine activities and also increases the waste clean-up budgets of small communities living on remote islands. ?? 2020",

Short-term dynamics based on GPS-trackers,"The dynamics of plastic debris were assessed in the Seine River, especially in the estuary, using plastic bottles equipped with GPS-trackers. In one year, 50 trajectories were recorded, covering a wide range of hydrometeorological conditions. Results show a succession of stranding/remobilization episodes in combination with alternating upstream and downstream transport in the estuary. In the end, 100% of the tracked bottles stranded somewhere, for hours or weeks, from one to several times at different sites. The overall picture shows that different physical phenomena interact with various time scales ranging from hours/days (high/low tides) to weeks/months (spring/neap tides and highest tides) and years (seasonal river flow). Thus, the fate of plastic debris is highly unpredictable, but the consequence of those interactions is that the transfer of debris is chaotic and not straightforward, and its residence time is much longer than the transit time of water. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Microplastics separated from the gut of 32 out of the 123 fishes (26%) examined were identified using Attenuated Total Reflectance ?€? Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR), and Raman Spectroscopy. In total, 69 microplastic particles, represented by fibers, foam and fragments were recovered from the fish, with sizes ranging from 0.89 to 4.85 mm. The ATR-FTIR spectral analyses revealed the presence of polymers polyethylene and Nylon 6. The occurrence of PP, Nylon 6, PET and PBT were confirmed using Raman spectroscopy. The presence of MPs in the gut content of alien fish P. brachypomus could be a reflection of the increasing microplastics pollution in the estuaries and backwaters along the south-west coast of India. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Three connected laboratory experiments using the filter-feeding mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the omnivorous polichaete Hediste diversicolor were conducted to evaluate whether the filtering action by mussels affects the vertical transfer of MP of different sizes (MPSMALL = 41 ??m; MPLARGE = 129 ??m) and densities (polyamide = 1.15 g cm???3; polypropylene = 0.92 g cm???3) across compartments and species with different feeding modes. Mussels significantly removed MP from the water column by incorporating them into biodeposits. This effect was particularly evident for the MPSMALL, whose deposition from the water column to the bottom was enhanced (about 15%) by the action of mussels. The incorporation of MP into faecal pellets increased the particles?€? sinking velocity by about 3?€?4 orders of magnitude. Conversely, the MP presence significantly decreased the depositional velocities of faecal pellets, and the magnitude of this effect was greater with increasing MP size and decreasing density. The MP incorporation into mussels?€? biodeposits also more than doubled the amount of MP uptake by H. diversicolor. We conclude that detrital pathways could be a transfer route of MP across marine compartments and food webs, potentially affecting the distribution of MP in sediments and creating hot-spots of bioavailable MP. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Mussels?€? biodeposits facilitate MP transfer from the water column to benthic detritus-feeding polychaetes. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

However, coastal marine sediments and their resident communities play critical roles in the transformation of organic matter and the cycling of nutrients that influence both local and global processes. To investigate how microplastics influence ecosystem functions associated with sediment biogeochemistry, large bivalves and microphytobenthos, we conducted a 31-day laboratory experiment. The experiment tested the role of micro-polyethylene terephthalate (mPETs) at five concentrations (0%, 1%, 3%, 6%, and 8% based on wet weight of top 1 cm sediment). Canonical principle of coordinate analysis (CAP) was applied to assess change on the ecosystem functionality with increasing concentrations of mPETs.

The backwashing diffusion coefficient was estimated from the average residence time of the beached plastics and the beach width, and then the beaching diffusion coefficient was estimated from the flux-balance assumption between the beaching and backwashing fluxes. Finite difference calculations in the staggered-grid system demonstrated that the amount of beached plastics responds as predicted by the linear system analysis when the beach had an exponential decay type of unit impulse response regardless of the ratio between the residence time and the period of beaching flux fluctuation from the nearshore. The condition in which the flux balance assumption holds was also discussed. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The model included a constant along-coast current, horizontal diffusion, onshore/offshore wind drift, beach/cliff combinations and point/distributed litter sources. The default model reproduced basic properties of observed beach litter loadings (zero net accumulation, negatively skewed loading distributions) and the observed spatial pattern along the Scottish east coast, with average loadings increasing in the coastal current direction. The VaWWL effect moved the along-coast flux of floating litter offshore as debeaching events occur during offshore winds. Varying diffusion, coastal current speed, windage, beach/cliff combinations and different foreshore boundary conditions were investigated. Reconciling model predictions with previous estimates of plastic inflow suggested sinking rates of up to 90% soon after first entry into the sea. The VaWWL effect offers a realistic boundary condition for particle-tracking models. ?? 2020",

Following experimental exposure of polystyrene microbeads (micro-PS of 6 and 10 ??m) at 0.25, 2.5, and 25 ??g L???1, which demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease of energy balance in the pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera, a transcriptomic study was conducted on mantle tissue. Transcriptomic data helped us to decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in P. margaritifera responses to micro-PS and search more broadly for effects on energetically expensive maintenance functions. Genes related to the detoxification process were impacted by long-term micro-PS exposure through a decrease in antioxidant response functioning, most likely leading to oxidative stress and damage, especially at higher micro-PS doses. The immune response was also found to be dose-specific, with a stress-related activity stimulated by the lowest dose present after a 2-month exposure period. This stress response was not observed following exposure to higher doses, reflecting an energy-limited capacity of pearl oysters to cope with prolonged stress and a dramatic shift to adjust to pessimum conditions, mostly limited and hampered by a lowered energetic budget. This preliminary experiment lays the foundation for exploring pathways and gene expression in P. margaritifera, and marine mollusks in general, under MP exposure. We also propose a conceptual framework to properly assess realistic MP effects on organisms and population resilience in future investigations. ?? 2020 The Authors",

The ingestion of these pollutants by marine organisms has drawn global attention. This work studies the distribution pattern and characteristics of MPs found in the body of the clam Donax cuneatus and its environment in order to understand the possible relationship between the MP concentration in the environment (water and sediment) and that in the clam's body. Samples of D. cuneatus were collected from the coast between Vembar and Periyathazhai in Tuticorin district along GoM. MP concentrations range from 0.6 to 1.3 items/g (wet weight) in clams, 10?€?30 items/l in water, and 24?€?235 items/kg in sediment. Small-sized clams contain the highest concentration of MPs. Hence it is hypothesised that allometric relationship exists between body size and MP concentration, depending on the surface-area to volume ratio. MP abundance in clam body has a clear, positive, significant correlation with MP abundance in sediment but not with abundance of MP in water. Microplastics of fiber type with size 100?€?250 ??m have a predominant presence in clams. The study identified ten types of polymers, of which polyethylene is the most common polymer in all sample types. FTIR-ATR spectra and surface morphology indicate that most of the microplastics have been strongly weathered. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis detected heavy metals associated with MPs like Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni and Fe. Filter-feeding clams like Donax sp. can provide valuable information on the spatial patterns of MP distribution, and so can act as bio-indicators in monitoring MP pollution in coastal areas.

Three waste categories based on the items use were considered: single-use, fishing-related and generic-use. Over 600 sampling sites, just 14% of these were litter-free. The five-years average density of seafloor litter was 79.6 items/km2 and ranged between 46.8 in 2019 and 118.1 items/km2 in 2015. The predominant waste type was plastic (58% of all items). Regardless of material type, single-use items were a dominant (60% of items) and widespread (79% of hauls) fraction of litter with a mean density of 48.4 items/km2. Fishing-related items accounted for 12% of total litter items. Percentage of dirty hauls and litter density increased with depth. Analysis of the relation density-depth indicates a progressive increase of litter density beyond depth values situated within the interval 234?€?477 m depending on the litter category. A significant decrease in litter density by categories was observed over the period. Patterns of spatial distribution at the higher depths (200?€?80 0m) resulted stable over the years. Density hotspots of fishing-related items were found where the fishing activity that uses fish aggregating devices (FADs) is practised and in the proximity of rocky banks.

Micro- and macroinvertebrates can mistake MPs or small microplastics (SMPs, <100 ??m) to be food particles and easily ingest them according to the size of their mouthparts. SMPs may then block the passage of food through the intestinal tract (i.e. hepatopancreas), accumulate within the organism, and enter the food web. Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) are allochthonous filter-feeding bivalve mollusks, which have been introduced in coastal seas around the world in both natural banks and farms. Considering their economic and ecological value, these bivalves have been chosen as a model to study the ingestion of SMPs. A novel method for the extraction and purification of SMPs in bivalves was developed. Quantification and simultaneous polymer identification of SMPs using Micro-FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) were performed, with a limit of detection for the particle size of 5 ??m. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
D7RHAZFD,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115184,Effects of long-term exposure to microfibers on ecosystem services provided by coastal mussels,"The biofiltration capacity of bivalve populations is known to alleviate the effects of coastal eutrophication. However, this important ecosystem service could potentially be impaired by the increasing microplastic abundance in near shore environments. It is known that relatively large microplastics (???500 ??m) impair the filtration capacity of bivalves. However, the effect of smaller microplastics, and specifically microfibers, is not known even though they are more common in many natural systems and similar in size to phytoplankton, the main food source of mussels. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term exposure to microfibers (MFs), which are smaller than 100 ??m, on the biofiltration capacity of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. Our findings show that long-term exposure (here 39 days) to microfibers significantly reduced (21%) the clearance of phytoplankton (Tetraselmis sp). While previous studies have shown that larger microplastics can decrease the filtration capacity of mussels after short-term exposure, our findings suggest that, for smaller MFs, mussel's clearance capacity is significantly affected after long-term exposure (39 days in this study). This may be due to the accumulation of MFs in the digestive system. In addition, the most efficient phytoplankton consumers were more susceptible to MF accumulation in the digestive system. This suggests that prolonged exposure to MF of coastal mussels could negatively impact the biofiltration of more potent individuals, thus decreasing the ecosystem service potential of the population as a whole. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd We found that long-term exposure to small microfibers can impair the phytoplankton clearance by coastal mussels. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The results showed that 30?€?40% of the anchovies had ingested anthropogenic microparticles (on average, 0.34 ?? 0.29 fibres ind???1 and 0.12 ?? 0.12 fragments ind???1). The fibres were probably ingested via filtration, and were significantly correlated with the gut fullness. Fibres were mostly dark, but the presence of other colours was frequent, indicating a general lack of selectivity. Plastic fragments composed of polyethylene and polypropylene were prevalently transparent, suggesting active predation, especially for larger fragments resembling zooplankton. No significant differences were recorded for the frequency of fish containing particles among females, males, and undetermined individuals. The presence of, generally, only one anthropogenic item per fish, as observed for 95.8% of fish containing microparticles, indicated that the permanence of these particles in the stomachs was short, likely no more than 1 day, although it could also depend on low environmental concentrations. The evaluation of the intestinal lumen indicated that a portion of the plastic fragments found in the stomach could not be ejected. Hard fragments that were larger than the intestinal lumen could be held for longer times, but probably regurgitation, fragmentation, and embedding in a biological matrix may facilitate their quick elimination. It is pivotal to understand the processes that regulate the abundance and the residential time of anthropogenic particles in commercial organisms captured for human nutrition, given the potential biomagnification of toxic substances carried by ingested particles. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

Light and fluorescence microscopy were used for the quantification of potential MPs. Furthermore, micro-Raman microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray were used to identify the polymer types and composition of MPs. The results showed that 80% of samples had at least one plastic particle and fibers were the most abundant shapes of MPs. Moreover, polyethylene terephthalate (32.8%) was the most common polymer type in canned fish samples. The fish, food additives, and contact materials during the cleaning and canning process are possible sources of MPs. Human intake estimation of MPs showed the possibility of plastics absorption by humans who consume canned fish several times/week. Hence, the results of this study showed the importance of MPs' guidelines for food safety and hygiene. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

We experimentally investigated ingestion and effects of MPs (20 ??m polyethylene spheres) on the arctic copepods Calanus finmarchicus, C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus. These species dominate arctic zooplankton biomass and are relevant target species to investigate the potential impacts of MPs on the Arctic marine ecosystem. Females of each species were exposed to two concentrations of MPs (200 and 20,000 MPs L???1) in combination with different food (diatom) concentrations, reflecting high (3000?€?5000 cells mL???1, spring phytoplankton bloom) and low (50?€?500 cells mL???1, pre/post bloom) food conditions. MPs did not affect negatively fecal pellet production rates in any of the species at the studied exposure concentrations. However, egg production rates of copepods exposed to MPs were 8 times higher compared with the controls, which suggests that MP exposure can cause stress-induced spawning in arctic copepods. Microscopic examination of the fecal pellets confirmed ingested MPs in the three species (up to aprox. 1000 MPs cop???1 d???1). The number of MPs per pellet decreased exponentially with increasing food concentration. The daily ingestion of MPs per copepod was higher at low- food concentrations (250?€?500 cells mL???1). At our exposure conditions, the presence of MPs inside C. hyperboreus fecal pellets did not affect their sinking rates. Overall, our experimental research show that 1) acute exposure to virgin polyethylene MPs has a low impact on arctic Calanus species at environmentally relevant MP concentrations, independent of food availability, and 2) arctic copepods influence the environmental fate of plankton-sized MPs by exporting buoyant MPs from the surface layer to the sea floor via fecal pellets. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Several studies have report ingestion and entanglement of seabird species in plastic debris but just few describe plastic presence in nests. Here we report the first evidence of a novel artificial nesting colony of red-legged cormorant (Phalacrocorax gaimardi) using plastic as nesting material in two major seaport structures in Northern Chile. We sampled 18 abandoned nests and determined that overall nests contained plastic: industrial polypropylene bulk bags (35%), plastic bags (33%) and fishing gear (10%). Plastic types differ among seaports, ENAEX (National Company of Explosives) seaport located near the main city contained plastic bags as predominant material while GNL (Liquid Natural Gas Company) seaport located near the industrial area contained bulkbag fibers.

This wide usage of plastics includes the employment of microspheres in common personal care products, which end up being ultimately released into the aquatic compartment. Known ecotoxicological effects of microplastics favoured the search for technologically viable and environmentally safer alternatives, such as paraffin wax microparticles, whose ecotoxicological risks have not been entirely characterized. To address this gap, the present study exposed mussels (Mytilus sp.) for 96 h to three densities (5 mg/L, 20 mg/L and 80 mg/L) of four size ranges (100?€?300 ??m, 300?€?500 ??m, 400?€?850 ??m, and 800?€?1200 ??m) of paraffin wax particles. Toxicological endpoints were the activities of four enzymes involved in key cellular processes, including antioxidant defence (catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GRed) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) and phase II metabolism (glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)), as well as lipid content and fatty acid profiles of the digestive gland. Significant interactions between the presence/absence of food and paraffin particle density were found, as food sometimes worked as a confounding factor in the analysed biomarkers. Despite this uncertainty, some overall patterns emerged. In general, smaller paraffin wax particles (100?€?300 ??m) caused little effects on the activity of the four enzymes tested, whereas larger particles (800?€?1200 ??m) caused significant effects on almost all biomarkers. CAT activity was enhanced in animals exposed to larger paraffin particles, whilst GPx activity was depressed; GRed activity was not affected by the exposure to paraffin particles. The activity of GSTs was enhanced, but only in one tested condition. No effects were observed in terms of the total lipid content and fatty acids of exposed animals. Overall, data obtained in this work suggest that, at densities of paraffin wax particles comparable to the levels found in the environment for microplastic beads, no toxicity is expected to occur in the tested mussel species, by measuring the here-assessed toxicological endpoints. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

This study presents the very first data on the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in the Adour Estuary, SW France. The experimental data set was complemented by numerical simulations to gain understanding of the behaviour of suspended microplastics. Microplastics were found throughout the water column with a mean abundance of 1.13 part/m3. Films and fragments were the most abundant types of particles collected. Numerical simulations demonstrated that vertical distribution of microplastics in the water column is highly dependent on particle characteristics and on the local hydrodynamics. The main trend is that neutrally-buoyant microplastics are easily flushed out while heavier microplastics are prone to entrapment in the estuary, in particular under low discharge conditions. The present study suggest that estuaries could be a sink of microplastics. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Field studies linking MPs and PAEs in seawater have not yet been reported. We investigate for the first time the correlation between MPs contamination and the presence of PAEs in the surface seawater of Jiaozhou Bay (JZB), a semi-enclosed metropolitan bay in northern China heavily impacted by human activity. The abundance of MPs, dominated by polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate mostly smaller than 2 mm, ranged between 24.44 items/m3 and 180.23 items/m3, with the majority being black and transparent fibers and fragments. Concentrations of PAEs varied from 129.96 ng/L to 921.22 ng/L. Relatively higher abundances of MPs and higher concentrations of PAEs were generally found in areas near riverine inputs and sewage treatment plants. There was a strong correlation between PAEs concentration and MPs abundance, suggesting that they are closely linked. In a risk assessment combining PAEs and MPs, the risk quotients (RQs) indicated that the ecological risk of di-n-butyl phthalate in JZB was relatively high (0.046&lt;RQ &lt; 0.516); the risk of the other PAEs were low.

Here we present a novel machine learning algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that is capable of detecting and quantifying floating and washed ashore plastic litter. The aquatic plastic litter detection, classification and quantification system (APLASTIC-Q) was developed and trained using very high geo-spatial resolution imagery (???5 pixels cm-1 = 0.002 m pixel-1) captured from aerial surveys in Cambodia. APLASTIC-Q was made up of two machine learning components (i) plastic litter detector (PLD-CNN) and (ii) plastic litter quantifier (PLQ-CNN). PLD-CNN managed to categorize targets as water, sand, vegetation and plastic litter with an 83% accuracy. It also provided a qualitative count of litter as low or high based on a thresholding approach. PLQ-CNN further distinguished and enumerated the litter items in each of the classes defined as water bottles, Styrofoam, canisters, cartons, bowls, shoes, polystyrene packaging, cups, textile, carry bags small or large. The types and amounts of plastic litter provide benchmark information that is urgently needed for decision-making by policymakers, citizens and other public and private stakeholders.

Six CFRP strengthening schemes were designed for the external confinement and the effects of concrete type, clear spacing ratio, CFRP thickness and strengthening strategy on the stress-strain relationship were also investigated in this study. The test results show that similar axial compressive behavior was observed for CFRP partially wrapped normal concrete and seawater sea-sand concrete columns. Moreover, for the SSC specimens partially wrapped with two-layer CFRP strips, the average ultimate strengths were increased by 13.6?€?36.6% with the decrease of clear spacing ratio, while the average ultimate strains were improved by 22.3?€?91.9%.

The PCF of the hybrid tubes decreased with increasing CFRP winding angle from 30?? to 60?? (winding angle of 0?? was along the axial direction of the tube) while the hybrid tubes with the winding angle of 45?? showed the highest SEA and EA. A theoretical analysis was conducted on the effect of interaction on load bearing capacity and it is showed that the interactions between different materials can effectively enhance energy absorption. A comparison among the filament winding, vacuum bag forming and nested manufacturing processes was performed and the filament winding technique exhibited the highest improvement in crashworthiness of CFRP/Al hybrid tubes. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

To understand the early growth variability of largehead hairtail, we examined the linkages between early growth, as revealed by otolith microstructure, and the associated environmental variables over both spatial and temporal scales. Young-of-the-Year largehead hairtail were collected from three regions in the Bohai, Yellow and East China Seas between 29?? and 39?? N. Daily increment widths of sagittal otoliths were measured and used as a proxy for somatic growth. We found two spawning cohorts, Spring- and Summer-spawned cohorts, that showed latitudinal differences in both mean growth and growth pattern. The transition time from larval to juvenile stage was identified at around 40 days. Daily increment widths of two cohorts showed similar growth pattern in the first 40 days, while location had a marked effect on daily growth over 41?€?110 days. This suggests physiologically constrained growth pattern in larval stage, but more plastic growth subject to habitat-specific influences in juvenile stage. The gradient forest analysis identified sea bottom temperature, vertical temperature gradient, and sea surface salinity, as the most important variables in determining early growth. Latitudinal differences in early growth pattern and their response to environmental variables suggest adaptive plasticity of early growth, which has notable implication for the management and sustainable utilization of this important but heavily exploited resource in the China Seas. ?? 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",
H644HKMR,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111549,Seasonal ingestion of anthropogenic debris in an urban population of gulls,"Gulls are generalist seabirds, increasingly drawn to urban environments where many species take advantage of abundant food sources, such as landfill sites. Despite this, data on items ingested at these locations, including human refuse, is limited. Here we investigate ingestion of prey and anthropogenic debris items in boluses (regurgitated pellets) from Pacific Gulls (Larus pacificus). A total of 374 boluses were collected between 2018 and 2020 in Tasmania. Debris was present in 92.51% of boluses (n = 346), with plastic (86.63%, n = 324) and glass (64.71%, n = 242) being the most prominent types. An abundance of intact, household items (e.g., dental floss, food wrappers) suggest the gulls regularly feed at landfill sites. In addition, the boluses are deposited at a roosting site located within an important wetland, thus we propose that the gulls may be functioning as a previously unrecognised vector of anthropogenic debris from urban centres to aquatic environments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Here, we assess ingestion of synthetic particles (???0.5 mm) by barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, wintering on a remote island. Faecal samples were collected over a period of four wintering seasons. In total, 71 individual samples were assessed, with 79% of samples displaying at least one debris particle (maximum lengths 0.5?€?5 mm) from anthropogenic sources. The recovered synthetic debris were identified as micro-fibres (n = 166) and micro-fragments (n = 165). The number of synthetic particles detected per sample was generally low at 4.7 ?? 0.9, 43 (mean ?? SE, maximum): micro-fibres 2.3 ?? 0.3, 10; micro-fragments 2.3 ?? 0.8, 40. Particle numbers detected per gram of faecal sample differed amongst wintering seasons. Our results suggest that non-marine water birds can frequently ingest low quantities of synthetic particles in remote coastal habitats. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Given the extensive global occurrence of expansive soils, it is imperative to restrain the natural expansive and compressibility behavior of such soils to a controllable extent. Consequently, the present study examined the expansive and compressibility behavior of lime-stabilized marine clays reinforced with 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2% natural coir fibers (CF) and synthetic polypropylene fibers (PPF). Accordingly, a series of one-dimensional (1D) swell-consolidation and linear shrinkage tests were conducted on untreated and treated 7-day cured clay samples to examine their volume-change behavior. Results indicated an optial reduction in the swelling potential of the lime-stabilized clay upon the addition of 1% CF or 1.5% PPF and a maximum reduction in the linear shrinkage of the clay upon the addition of 2% CF or 1.5% PPF, respectively. Similarly, an optimal reduction in the compressibility of the lime-stabilized clay was achieved upon the addition of 2% CF or 1% PPF. The microstructural analysis showed the formation of cementation compounds (C-S-H and C-A-H) owing to the clay-lime interaction. The reported findings engaged the concurrent application of lime and natural/synthetic fibers to improve the expansive and compressibility behavior of soft marine clayey deposits. ?? 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

This study aimed to investigate the growth performance and nutritional quality of sea worms (Nereis sp.) fed with Hermetia illucens maggot flour and grated coconut (Cocos nucifera). Nereis sp. individuals were cultured at a density of 100/plastic container for 35 days, and fed twice daily with a feeding rate of 5% of the total body weight. This study used five treatments, i.e.: A. 50% maggot flour and 50% coconut grated, B. 75% maggot flour and 25% coconut grated, C. 25% maggot flour and 75% grated coconut, D. 100% maggot flour, and E. 100% coconut grated. The results showed that the sea worms fed on maggot flour and grated coconut had a significant effect (P < 0.01) on the survival rate (SR), feed conversion rate (FCR), and feed efficiency. Treatment D showed the highest absolute growth value, specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency, and SR (0.45 g, 3.25%, 49.23%, and 99.67%). Feeding rate n ranged from 30.50% to 34.67%, and the FCR value ranged from 2.07-2.43%. The highest nutrient contents were observed in treatment D, with 54.05% protein, 22.54% fatty acid, 55.46 ppm methionine, and 10.98% EPA.

CHPIWR2I,10.1016/j.jsames.2020.102737,Liquefaction source layer for sand blows induced by the 2016 megathrust earthquake (Mw 7.8) in Ecuador (Boca de Brice??o),"Numerous sand boils were generated in the alluvial plain at the mouth of the Rio Brice??o valley (Ecuador) during the Mw 7.8 earthquake of April 2016. The area is characterized by a series of raised marine terraces formed as a consequence of the rapid tectonic coastal uplift during the Quaternary. Boreholes and geotechnical investigations were carried during post-earthquake surveys and for the purpose of mitigating the liquefaction effects. Five lithological units were identified at a site of embankment, which represented continental-marine and transitional sedimentation since the Last Glacial Maximum. A comprehensive study of texture and petrographic composition of sand boils has been performed and compared with sandy silts and silty sands of the buried sedimentary sequence in order to identify the source levels for liquefaction. The petrographic components, in particular the low content of bioclasts and carbonate fragments of the sand boils, allow to pinpoint a source layer made up of fine-grained silty sands located between 2 and 4.5 m depth (Unit 2) whereas the deeper marine sands, richer in bioclasts, were not involved. The results support the idea that earthquake-induced liquefaction phenomena are not restricted to clean sands and well-sorted deposits, but may affect sand layers with significant amount of non-plastic silt. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
L8GLA5QP,10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.111117,Experimental research on compressive behavior of seawater and sea sand concrete-filled RPC tubes,"To address the dilemma of structures constructed with seawater and sea sand concrete (SWSSC), including insufficient durability and high cost, an innovative composite column, named SWSSC-filled reactive powder concrete (RPC) tube (SFRPC tube), is proposed and studied. This hybrid system is composed of a prefabricated RPC thin-wall hollow tube with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) hoops and infilled SWSSC. In order to understand the basic compressive performance of the proposed composite structure, a total of 24 short columns, with 300 mm outer diameter and 600 mm height, were tested in axial compression. SFRPC tube columns exhibited a multi-crack failure mode on the surface of tube without obvious peeling-off of the RPC cover. The RPC tube can serve as the permanent formwork, and maintain its own integrity in the whole loading process, carrying considerable axial load acting on the composite column, due to its super-high compressive strength. The results reveal that the SFRPC tube system effectively utilizes the ultra-high mechanical properties of RPC and FRP confinement effect. Compressive performance of SFRPC tube columns can be further improved as the volumetric FRP hoop ratio in RPC tube increases. It is found that overlapping joint methods for single FRP hoop in RPC tube and the thickness of RPC tube have no significant effect on the mechanical performance of SFRPC tube columns under the current testing conditions. A special confinement model was also proposed for assessing the axial load carrying capacity of SFRPC tube columns. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Metal-free materials are promising as green catalysts for wastewater purification. In this study, amorphous boron was applied as a metal-free activator to decompose peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the degradation of plasticizers in water. Integrating radical trapping and selectively quenching tests with kinetic evaluation and electrochemical analysis, hydroxyl radical was found to be the dominating reactive oxygen species (ROS). With a strong oxidative capacity, the boron/PMS system can effectively degrade both bisphenols and phthalates plasticizers. In contrast, a carbon nanotube-catalyzed PMS system mediated a nonradical pathway to oxidize the electron-rich plasticizer (bisphenol A), but ineffectively to decompose the highly recalcitrant phthalates plasticizers (diethyl phthalate). Moreover, we unveiled that the boron surface was oxidized to boron oxide during the redox reaction, and the oxide would be self-cleaned in the acidic solution to regenerate fresh boron and restore the activity during the cyclic operations. Therefore, this work not only gains new insights into the radical and nonradical oxidations by metal-free catalysis, but also provides feasible technologies for plasticizer purification in water. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
SD7P83AW,10.1785/0220200182,Imaging the tectonic grain of the northern cordillera orogen using transportable array receiver functions,"Azimuthal variations in receiver function conversions can image lithospheric structural contrasts and anisotropic fabrics that together compose tectonic grain. We apply this method to data from EarthScope Transportable Array in Alaska and additional stations across the northern Cordillera. The best-resolved quantities are the strike and depth of dipping fabric contrasts or interfaces. We find a strong geographic gradient in such anomalies, with large amplitudes extending inboard from the present-day subduction margin, the Aleutian arc, and an influence of flat-slab subduction of the Yakutat microplate north of the Denali fault. An east-west band across interior Alaska shows low-amplitude crustal anomalies. Anomaly amplitudes correlate with structural intensity (density of aligned geological elements), but are the highest in areas of strong Cenozoic deformation, raising the question of an influence of current stress state. Imaged subsurface strikes show alignment with surface structures. We see concentric strikes around arc volcanoes implying dipping magmatic structures and fabric into the middle crust. Regions with present-day weaker deformation show lower anomaly amplitudes but structurally aligned strikes, suggesting pre-Cenozoic fabrics may have been overprinted or otherwise modified. We observe general coherence of the signal across the brittle-plastic transition. Imaged crustal fabrics are aligned with major faults and shear zones, whereas intrafault blocks show imaged strikes both parallel to and at high angles to major block-bounding faults. High-angle strikes are subparallel to neotectonic deformation, seismicity, fault lineaments, and prominent metallogenic belts, possibly due to overprinting and/or co-evolution with fault-parallel fabrics. We suggest that the underlying tectonic grain in the northern Cordillera is broadly distributed rather than strongly localized. Receiver functions thus reveal key information about the nature and continuity of tectonic fabrics at depth and can provide unique insights into the deformation history and distribution of regional strain in complex orogenic belts. ??

Both GE and GO-GE composite specimens were initially exposed to natural seawater for a duration of 9 months. Desorption was also carried out for some of the seawater saturated samples. Before ageing, flexural test and dynamic mechanical analysis were carried out to understand the impact of GO incorporation on the characteristics of GE composite. Using gravimetric analysis, the seawater uptake kinetic curves were determined for both the composites. Long-term durability was assessed by performing stepwise isothermal creep and recovery tests in 30??C to 120??C temperature range and analysis of the results involved the use of time-temperature superposition principle for constructing the creep master isotherms in different conditions (before ageing or dry state, saturated state, and desorbed state). ?? 2020 Society of Plastics Engineers",

Open fractures exhibiting regular en-echelon patterns were captured by a 12-megapixel, FL-9 mm camera attached to a Phantom IV UAS over the epicenter of the magnitude (Mw) 5.8 earthquake of September 3, 2016, 15 months later. The Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and orthoimagery offered a spatial resolution (???1 cm) sufficient to identify small-scale plastic deformations that appear to be controlled by en-echelon joint sets developed in the underlying formation. The fissure boundaries and intersections are remarkably linear and sharp. They appeared to have been recently formed, presumably by seismic swarms believed to have been associated with wastewater injection. The DSMs revealed a series of conjugate patterns suggestive of regional systematic joints with apparent subsidence of infilling up to 50 cm. The earthquakes emanated from the Precambrian metamorphic basement, with epicentral clusters at ???5- and 8-km depths. Low energy release from depths &gt;1.5 km appears to be locally attenuated by an unconsolidated ?€?soil cap,?€? which likely formed an impedance contrast. The maximum deformation direction from the cumulative energy of earthquakes correlates with a wrench fault tectonics model that could conceivably produce the observed en-echelon joint sets observed in the orthoimagery and DSMs. These features were observed within 275 m of the reported Mw 5.8 epicenter. The remarkably linear repeating pattern of deformation appears to express fissures that preserve the wrench fault fractures generated by the Mw 5.8 earthquake emanating from discontinuity suites within marine sandstone, shale, and limestone of Pennsylvanian to Permian age. ?? 2020 Geological Society of America.

Spatial and temporal concurrence of C. fornicata larvae within the zooplankton community occurs throughout the O. edulis spawning season. A C. fornicata larval peak density of 374.7 ?? 96.5 larvae/ml (mean ?? SD) was observed in Langston Harbour sympatrically with O. edulis density of 45.7 ?? 20.1 larvae/ml in early August. Overall oyster larvae contribution to the zooplankton community was higher in Portsmouth Harbour (12%) than C. fornicata contribution (9.6%), whilst the opposite occurred in Langstone (oysters, 11.7%; C. fornicata, 12%). Larval abundance is not reflected in recruitment on the seabed, owing to the conspecific substrate preference of O. edulis. Settlement of O. edulis spat was significantly greater on settlement discs covered with recently deceased oyster shells; 6.7 ?? 1.2 (mean ?? SE) spat/disc vs old smooth oyster shells, 2.7 ?? 1.3, C. fornicata shell 1.7 ?? 0.3, cemented discs 2 ?? 1 or the plastic control disc 0.7 ?? 0.7. Settlement substrate type matters in the presence of high benthic and larval densities of C. fornicata. The Solent has become a substrate-limited system for O. edulis; substrate management or reef deployment is required to restore a self-recruiting population. Finally, although C. fornicata may provide functional equivalence in terms of filtering services, it supports a significantly different and less biodiverse faunal community from that of O. edulis. Therefore C. fornicata does not provide equivalence as an ecosystem engineer and mechanisms of ecological phase shift are occurring within areas dominated by this invasive species. ?? 2020 The Authors.

ZX9KSAFX,10.5194/os-16-1317-2020,Beaching patterns of plastic debris along the Indian Ocean rim,"A large percentage of global ocean plastic waste enters the Northern Hemisphere Indian Ocean (NIO). Despite this, it is unclear what happens to buoyant plastics in the NIO. Because the subtropics in the NIO are blocked by landmass, there is no subtropical gyre and no associated subtropical garbage patch in this region. We therefore hypothesize that plastics ""beach"" and end up on coastlines along the Indian Ocean rim. In this paper, we determine the influence of beaching plastics by applying different beaching conditions to Lagrangian particle-tracking simulation results. Our results show that a large amount of plastic likely ends up on coastlines in the NIO, while some crosses the Equator into the Southern Hemisphere Indian Ocean (SIO). In the NIO, the transport of plastics is dominated by seasonally reversing monsoonal currents, which transport plastics back and forth between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. All buoyant plastic material in this region beaches within a few years in our simulations. Countries bordering the Bay of Bengal are particularly heavily affected by plastics beaching on coastlines. This is a result of both the large sources of plastic waste in the region and the ocean dynamics that concentrate plastics in the Bay of Bengal. During the intermonsoon period following the southwest monsoon season (September, October, November), plastics can cross the Equator on the eastern side of the NIO basin into the SIO. Plastics that escape from the NIO into the SIO beach on eastern African coastlines and islands in the SIO or enter the subtropical SIO garbage patch. ?? 2020 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.",

However, the durability of BFRP bars in a real coral concrete alkaline marine environment has not been extensively investigated. In this study, the mechanical properties of BFRP bars in coral and ordinary concrete were investigated by using the accelerated erosion method in a laboratory environment. A total of 85 specimens were designed and produced. The BFRP bars were subjected to tensile testing to examine the degradation in their mechanical properties after being immersed in artificial seawater solution at indoor temperatures of 40 ??C and 60 ??C for 60 d, 120 d, 180 d, and 220 d. The results indicated that the tensile strength and ultimate tensile strain of the BFRP bars exhibited different degrees of degradation at various ages and environmental conditions, although the elastic modulus did not change considerably. The temperature considerably influenced the degradation rate of the tensile strength of the BFRP bars. Moreover, the degradation rate of the tensile strength of the BFRP bars in coral concrete was higher than that of the BFRP bars in ordinary concrete at the same ambient temperature. The experimental results pertaining to the microstructural characteristics of coral aggregates and the degradation mechanism of the mechanical properties of BFRP bars were discussed. Subsequently, based on the Fick and Arrhenius degradation models, the lifetime prediction of BFRP bars in coral concrete under a marine environment was conducted.

Hybrid bars combine the advantages of both FRP and steel bars in enhancing the ultimate strength, ductility, and corrosion resistance compared with pure FRP or steel bars. Twelve half-scale ECC-concrete beams were tested to study the flexure behaviour under four-points loading test using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) ECC fibers. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers were used in the ECC mix for this purpose. The experimental variables are the hybrid reinforcement ratios (0.85%, 1.26%, and 1.7%), PVA fiber ratio (0.0%, 0.75%, and 1.5%) and hybrid schemes (hybrid and GFRP bars). The test results showed significant enhancement in the capacity of ECC concrete beams reinforced with hybrid bars or hybrid schemes. The achieved enhancements are 12% and 27% for PVA ratio of 0.75% and 1.5% respectively. In the presence of PVA fibers, the ultimate strain of the bars is higher than that registered in the absence of PVA fibers. Non-linear finite element analysis (NLFEA) was carried out to validate the experimental results. The NLFEA is adequately simulating the experimental results. Nominal flexural strength and flexural rigidity were assessed with the experimental test results and validated with 77 available ECC-concrete beams from the literature. The validation proved that the assessments of the nominal flexural strength and flexural rigidity are performed well in the prediction. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity study is conducted to illustrate the effect of PVA-ECC on the flexural rigidity of the beams. The experimental evidence presented in the current study demonstrates the feasibility and plausible future of the novel hybrid bars and PVA fibers especially for marine and waterfront concrete structures. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Here, we demonstrate that mangroves, generally supporting high sediment accretion rates, efficiently sequester plastics in their sediments. To this end, we extracted microplastics from dated sediment cores of the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf mangrove (Avicennia marina) forests along the Saudi Arabian coast. We found that microplastics <0.5 mm dominated in mangrove sediments, helping explain their scarcity, in surface waters. We estimate that 50 ?? 30 and 110 ?? 80 metric tons of plastic may have been buried since the 1930s in mangrove sediments across the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf, respectively. We observed an exponential increase in the plastic burial rate (8.5 ?? 1.2% year-1) since the 1950s in line with the global plastic production increase, confirming mangrove sediments as long-term sinks for plastics. ?? 2020 The Authors.",

Case study in Masohi, Central Maluku","Human pressure on the coastal and aquatic surrounding ecosystem in Indonesia, through plastic waste, is increasing, considering that 60 % of the approximately 250 million people live in the coastal areas. Plastic waste originating from human activities has become a massive problem in almost all the small island and coastal regions, especially in the eastern part of Indonesia. This condition is caused by poor waste management and a lack of public awareness in disposing of waste in its place, including in an area known as its marine biodiversities and marine tourism spots like Masohi in Central Maluku. Also, the composition of waste is dominated by plastic waste that cannot be decomposed in a short period, continue circulated on the ocean currents, and will be deposited in coastal areas. Furthermore, some plastic waste will break down into micro-plastics that pollute not only the environment but also marine biota, which are often consumed by humans. This situation profoundly affects the sustainability and function of aquaecosystem services in coastal areas.

In the present contribution we suggest considering ionic liquids as extractants, since they show several advantageous properties that may facilitate the design of efficient separation processes. Through varying the anion and the side chain at the cation, the interactions between the extractant and the polymer can be strengthened and tuned, and thereby the disintegration of the particle into separate polymer chains can be controlled. Oxidized moieties can also be efficiently solvated, given the amphiphilic nature of the considered ionic liquids, allowing also realistic particles to be extracted into these solvents. The phase transfer was found to be thermodynamically and kinetically possible, which is supported by the complicated structure of the ionic liquid-water interface through the rearrangement of the interfacial ions, and the formation of a micelle around the plastic already at the edge of the aqueous phase. ?? 2020 The Authors.

2ZIEJD65,10.3389/fmars.2020.552688,Preliminary Results From Detection of Microplastics in Liquid Samples Using Flow Cytometry,"Microplastics are globally recognized as contaminants in freshwater and marine aquatic systems. To date there is no universally accepted protocol for isolation and quantification of microplastics from aqueous media. Various methodologies exist, many of which are time consuming and have the potential to introduce contaminants into samples, thereby obscuring characterization of the environmental microplastic load. Here, we present first steps in the detection of microplastics in liquid samples, based on their fluorescent staining followed by high throughput analysis and quantification using Flow Cytometry. Using controlled laboratory settings nine polymer types [polystyrene (PS); polyethylene (PE); polyethylene terephthalate (PET/PETE); high density polyethylene (HDPE); low density polyethylene (LDPE); polyvinyl chloride (PVC); polypropylene (PP); nylon (PA); polycarbonate (PC)] were tested for identification and quantification in freshwater. All nine plastic types were stained with 10 ??g/mL Nile Red in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide with a 10 min incubation time. The lowest spatial detectable limit for plastic particles was 200 nm. Out of the nine polymer types chosen for the study PS, PE, PET, and PC were well-identified; however, results for other plastic types (PVC, PP, PA, LDPE, and HDPE) were masked to certain extent by Nile Red aggregation and precipitation. The methodology presented here permits identification of a range of particle sizes and types. It represents a significant step in the quantification of microplastics by replacing visual data interpretation with a sensitive and automated method. ??

EW78JLYA,10.1021/acs.est.0c02374,Profiling the Vertical Transport of Microplastics in the West Pacific Ocean and the East Indian Ocean with a Novel in Situ Filtration Technique,"A new technique involving large-volume (10 m3) samples of seawater was used to determine the abundance of microplastics (MPs) in the water column in the West Pacific Ocean and the East Indian Ocean. Compared to the conventional sampling methods based on smaller volumes of water, the new data yielded abundance values for the deep-water column that were at least 1-2 orders of magnitude lower. The data suggested that limited bulk volumes currently used for surface sampling are insufficient to obtain accurate estimates of MP abundance in deep water. Size distribution data indicated that the lateral movement of MPs into the water column contributed to their movement from the surface to the bottom. This study provides a reliable dataset for the water column to enable a better understanding of the transport and fate of plastic contamination in the deep-ocean ecosystem. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

Microplastic particles (3000 ??m) of three most commonly mass-produced polymers (polystyrene - PS, polyethylene terephthalate - PET and polyethylene - PE) were applied in environmentally realistic concentrations (0.1% of sediment dry weight) in a laboratory experiment imitating the natural environment, typical for sea trout spawning grounds. The exposure of the sea trout, from fertilized eggs to mobile yolk-sac larvae, to microplastics did not affect the hatching success (the survival of embryos), hatching rate and the incubation period. Microplastics of any tested polymer type also had no adverse effect on the larvae survival, growth rate and the rate of yolk sack absorption. Similarly, no changes in frequencies of detected cytotoxicity endpoints compared to the control group were recorded. Exposure to polymer particles induced however the formation of genotoxicity endpoints (nuclear buds, micronuclei and blebbed nuclei cells). The level of total genotoxicity (??Gentox) in fish larvae erythrocytes increased significantly in the following sequence: PS > PET > PE. No significant changes in the whole body corticosterone, dehydrocorticosterone and cortisone concentrations due to exposure to microplastics were recorded, while cortisol was detected in larvae exposed to PS. Our results show that long-term, non-ingestion related exposure to microplastics does not affect development of S. trutta early life stages but may lead to genotoxic responses. PS seems to be the most hazardous among all polymers studied. This is the first study demonstrating non-ingestion related toxicity of microplastics to the early life stages of fish. ?? 2020 The Authors",
IVG8RB3W,10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02801,Development and Application of a Mass Spectrometry Method for Quantifying Nylon Microplastics in Environment,"The quantitative detection methods for many microplastic (MP) polymers in the environment are inadequate. For example, effective detection methods for nylon (polyamide, PA), a widely used plastic, in different environmental samples are still lacking. In the present study, a method based on acid depolymerization-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and without the separation of MPs from samples was developed to quantify nylon MPs. After removing the background monomer compounds, PA6 and PA66 were efficiently depolymerized to 6-aminocaproic acid and adipic acid, respectively, and detected by LC-MS/MS. Accordingly, the quantity of nylon MPs was accurately calculated. By using the proposed method, the recovery of spiked PA6 and PA66 MPs in the environmental samples ranged from 90.8 to 98.8%. The limits of quantification for PA6 and PA66 MPs were 0.680 and 4.62 mg/kg, respectively. PA MPs were widely detected in indoor dust, sludge, marine sediment, freshwater sediment, fishery sediment, and fish guts and gills with concentrations of 0.725-321 mg/kg. Extremely high concentrations of PA66 MPs were detected in indoor dust and fish guts and gills, indicating the unequivocal risk of human exposure through dust ingestion and dietary exposure. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

The effect of different conditions, duration of conditioning, and the profile cross-section configuration on the mechanical properties were investigated. Three-point bending, tension, and compression tests were carried out to obtain the mechanical properties, including flexural, tensile and compressive strengths and tensile elastic modulus. Furthermore, in order to scrutiny the mechanisms and extent of damage, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on the test samples before and after the exposures. Finally, regression models were derived according to the experimental data to describe the mechanical properties of profiles after exposure to the aggressive environments used in this study. The maximum reductions of about 30%, 33% and 46% were observed in three-point bending, tensile and compressive tests, respectively amongst all samples when exposed for 90 days to simulated SWSSC. These reductions increased for the same sections to 52%, 47%, and 50% when the GFRP profiles were pre-exposed for 3000 h to UV radiation and moisture before exposing for 90 days to simulated SWSSC. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
DL9EQ6EL,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139894,Focused ultrasound-based extraction for target analysis and suspect screening of organic xenobiotics in fish muscle,"The development of multitarget and/or suspect screening methods for the analysis of xenobiotics in fish samples is compulsory due to the lack of works in the literature where a deep evaluation of the variables affecting extraction and clean-up steps is performed. The aim of the present work was to optimize and validate a multitarget (180 compounds) method for the analysis of priority and emerging xenobiotics in fish muscle using focused ultrasound-assisted solid-liquid extraction. From the different extraction solvents studied, a single extraction in cold acetonitrile rendered the best consensus results in terms of absolute recoveries and the number of target compounds extracted. Matrix effect was minimized using commercially available Captiva ND-Lipid filters, which provided clean extracts and satisfactory repeatability compared to other approaches. Absolute recoveries were corrected using matrix-matched calibration and apparent recoveries in the 43%-105%, 73%?€?131% and 78%?€?128% ranges were obtained at low (20 ng g???1), medium (100 ng g???1), and high (200 ng g???1) spiking levels, respectively. A 60% of the xenobiotics showed limits of identification lower than 20 ng g???1. The developed method was successfully applied to the quantification and suspect screening of samples bought in a local market (hake, gilt-head bream, sea bass and prawn) and fished (thicklip grey mullet) at the Urdaibai estuary (north of Spain). Food additives, antiparasitic drugs and PFOS were quantified at ng g???1 level. Moreover, the targeted method was extended to the suspect screening, revealing the presence of plastic related products (caprolactam, phthalates, polyethylenglycols), pharmaceutical products (albendazole, mebendazole, valpromide) and pesticides or insect repellents (icaridin, myristyl sulfate, nootkatone). Therefore, FUSLE in cold acetonitrile combined with Captiva ND-Lipid filters and liquid chromatography tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-q-Orbitrap) were successfully applied to both multitarget quantitative analysis and suspect screening of approx. 17,800 compounds. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
N2XRGU5J,10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c02247,Interfacial Assembly Inspired by Marine Mussels and Antifouling Effects of Polypeptoids: A Neutron Reflection Study,"Polypeptoid-coated surfaces and many surface-grafted hydrophilic polymer brushes have been proven efficient in antifouling-the prevention of nonspecific biomolecular adsorption and cell attachment. Protein adsorption, in particular, is known to mediate subsequent cell-surface interactions. However, the detailed antifouling mechanism of polypeptoid and other polymer brush coatings at the molecular level is not well understood. Moreover, most adsorption studies focus only on measuring a single adsorbed mass value, and few techniques are capable of characterizing the hydrated in situ layer structure of either the antifouling coating or adsorbed proteins. In this study, interfacial assembly of polypeptoid brushes with different chain lengths has been investigated in situ using neutron reflection (NR). Consistent with past simulation results, NR revealed a common two-step structure for grafted polypeptoids consisting of a dense inner region that included a mussel adhesive-inspired oligopeptide for grafting polypeptoid chains and a highly hydrated upper region with very low polymer density (molecular brush). Protein adsorption was studied with human serum albumin (HSA) and fibrinogen (FIB), two common serum proteins of different sizes but similar isoelectric points (IEPs). In contrast to controls, we observed higher resistance by grafted polypeptoid against adsorption of the larger FIB, especially for longer chain lengths. Changing the pH to close to the IEPs of the proteins, which generally promotes adsorption, also did not significantly affect the antifouling effect against FIB, which was corroborated by atomic force microscopy imaging. Moreover, NR enabled characterization of the in situ hydrated layer structures of the polypeptoids together with proteins adsorbed under selected conditions. While adsorption on bare SiO2 controls resulted in surface-induced protein denaturation, this was not observed on polypeptoids. Our current results therefore highlight the detailed in situ view that NR may provide for characterizing protein adsorption on polymer brushes as well as the excellent antifouling behavior of polypeptoids. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",
HAB964ZP,10.3389/fenvs.2020.579361,Transport and Behavior of Microplastics Emissions From Urban Sources in the Baltic Sea,"Urban sources, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), untreated wastewater (not connected to WWTPs), and especially combined sewer overflow systems (CSS) including stormwater are major pathways for microplastics in the aquatic environment. We compile microplastics emission data for the Baltic Sea region, calculate emissions for each pathway and develop emission scenarios for selected polymer types, namely polyethylene (PE)/polypropylene (PP) and the polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PE/PP and PET differ with respect to their density and can be regarded as representative for large groups of polymers. We consider particles between 20?€?500 ??m with varying shapes. The emission scenarios serve as input for 3D-model simulations, which allow us to estimate transport, behavior, and deposition in the Baltic Sea environment. According to our model results, the average residence time of PET and PE/PP in the Baltic Sea water body is about 14 days. Microplastics from urban sources cause average concentrations of 1.4 PE/PP (0.7 PET) particles/m2 sea surface (20?€?500 ??m size range) in the Baltic Sea during summer. Average concentrations of PET, resulting from urban sources, at the sea floor are 4 particles/m2 sediment surface during summer. Our model approach suggests that accumulation at the shoreline is the major sink for microplastic with annual coastal PE/PP and PET accumulation rates of up to 108 particles/m each near emission hot-spots and in enclosed and semi-closed systems. All concentrations show strong spatial and temporal variability and are linked to high uncertainties. The seasonality of CSS (including stormwater) emissions is assessed in detail. In the south-eastern Baltic, emissions during July and August can be up to 50% of the annual CSS and above 1/3 of the total annual microplastic emissions. The practical consequences especially for monitoring, which should focus on beaches, are discussed. Further, it seems that PET, PE/PP can serve as indicators to assess the state of pollution. ??

E2N8VQYK,10.5194/tc-14-3465-2020,Toward a method for downscaling sea ice pressure for navigation purposes,"Sea ice pressure poses great risk for navigation; it can lead to ship besetting and damages. Contemporary largescale sea ice forecasting systems can predict the evolution of sea ice pressure. There is, however, a mismatch between the spatial resolution of these systems (a few kilometres) and the typical dimensions of ships (a few tens of metres) navigating in ice-covered regions. In this paper, the downscaling of sea ice pressure from the kilometre-scale to scales relevant for ships is investigated by conducting high-resolution idealized numerical experiments with a viscous-plastic sea ice model. Results show that sub-grid-scale pressure values can be significantly larger than the large-scale pressure (up to4 times larger in our numerical experiments). High pressure at the sub-grid scale is associated with the presence of defects (e.g. a lead). Numerical experiments show significant stress concentration on both sides of a ship beset in sea ice, especially at the back. The magnitude of the stress concentration increases with the length of the lead (or channel) behind the ship and decreases as sea ice consolidates by either thermodynamical growth or mechanical closing. These results also highlight the difficulty of forecasting, for navigation applications, the small-scale distribution of pressure, and especially the largest values as the important parameters (i.e. the length of the lead behind the ship and the thickness of the refrozen ice) are not well constrained. ?? 2020 Royal Society of Chemistry.

MZGVJTYX,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140377,The first report on the source-to-sink characterization of microplastic pollution from a riverine environment in tropical India,"Microplastics are plastic pieces &lt;5 mm in size that are more harmful than large plastic debris. The world's oceans contain large amounts of these particles, and their presence is severely affecting the marine organisms. Smaller aquatic organisms ingesting microplastics, mistaking them for food, and their subsequent entry into the food chain is of significant concern. Rivers are major carriers of these materials from the terrestrial environment to the oceans. In this study, for the first time, we have done the source-to-sink characterization of microplastics (5 mm?€?0.3 mm) for a tropical Indian river, namely the Netravathi River, which debouches into the Arabian Sea. Here, we present a detailed investigation made on water, sediments and soil samples collected from the river catchment. All the samples showed the presence of microplastics with a mean numerical abundance of 288 pieces/m3 (water), 96 pieces/kg (sediment) and 84.45 pieces/kg (soil). Fibres, films and fragments are the main categories obtained from the catchment. The microplastics present in the samples were mostly transparent and white coloured which are due to the decay of plastic carry bags, packing materials and fishing lines. Different coloured microplastics were also present in lesser numbers. Polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are the most abundant polymers present in the samples. Fragmentation of larger plastic materials which is due to mismanaged solid waste and garment washing are the primary sources of these materials in the river catchment. Moreover, the sampling sites near to important pilgrim centres like Dharmasthala and Subrahmanya, register higher concentration of fibres released due to washing of clothes. The study concludes that the Netravathi River is contaminated with microplastics from its origin to the sink. However, the spatial distribution and abundance of microplastic particles demonstrate the influence of population distribution, land use and good household practices of waste management in some areas. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

This paper also discusses the current treatment technology of microplastics. The conclusions show that estuaries are severely affected by microplastics pollution; the accumulation of microplastics and adsorption of contaminants by microplastics could also lead to serious risks besides ingestion; there are few technologies that can efficiently remove microplastics pollution in sewage treatment plants.

However, knowledge of their impacts on phytoplankton, especially for the diatoms is scarce. Herein, the effects of different polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastic concentrations and contact times (24, 48, 72 and 96 h) on the Fv/Fm and cell density of Phaeodactylum tricornutum (B255), Chaetoceros gracilis (B13) and Thalassiosira sp. (B280) were investigated to evaluate the toxic effects of microplastics on marine diatoms. The effects of PVC microplastics on the morphology of the diatoms was observed by SEM. The order of sensitivity to 1 ??m PVC microplastics among three marine diatoms was B13 &gt; B280 &gt; B255, showing that the toxic effects varied with different microalgae species. Furthermore, the presence of a siliceous cell wall played a minimal role in protecting cells from the physical attack of PVC microplastics, with no significant difference from the common cell wall. PVC microplastics caused dose-dependent adverse effects on three marine diatoms. High PVC concentrations (200 mg/L) reduced the chlorophyll content, inhibited Fv/Fm, and affected the photosynthesis of three marine diatoms. The PVC microplastics adsorbed and caused physical damage on the structure of algal cells. Interactions between PVC microplastics and diatoms may be the probable reason for the negative effects of PVC on diatoms. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",

This study presents a novel approach to achieve this aim, by comparing the individual and combined ability of Particle Tracking Models (PTMs) and seasonal rainfall data, to explain observed inputs of microplastic pellets to the ocean beaches of Santos City (south-eastern Brazil). A Lagrangian PTM based on high-resolution hydrodynamic models was used to simulate seasonal patterns of pellet dispersal from five release points within the Santos Estuarine System (SES) and nearshore waters which are known contributors to the regions microplastic debris problem. Model outputs suggested that the debris field is likely to be small within the estuary (ranging from 3.6 to 8.1 km2), intermediate at the river mouth (mean 34 km2) and greatest for near- and offshore sites (ranging from 34 to 40 km2). The spatial footprints were strongly modulated by season (and rainfall), with simulations alone unable to reconcile daily inputs of pellets observed on the beaches of Santos Bay (ranging from 2 to 51 particles m2 ??? d?€?1). Given this discrepancy, a Generalized Additive Modeling approach was employed to integrate the PTM outputs with rainfall data to improve predictions of beached particles. Results confirmed that considering fluvial processes, could significantly improve the ability to predict rates of pellet accumulation (raising the explained deviance in observed inputs from 41 to 93%). Thus, the study highlights the potential to couple widely used dispersion models with metrics that describe fluvial forcing (rainfall and estuarine flushing) in order to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of microplastic debris transport and accumulation within dynamic coastal environments. ??

Then, the interactions of the corrosion and wear on the residual strength of the rope samples were analysed. The results show that the corrosion had a strong influence on the coefficient of friction (COF) and temperature rise of the wire rope. Additionally, surface corrosion reduced the anti-wear properties and fatigue resistance of the rope. The effect of sulfuric acid corrosion was the most obvious, followed by that of sea-water and fresh water. The maximum breaking force of the wire rope with sulfuric acid corrosion decreased rapidly with the wear time, from approximately 49.9 kN?€?41.5 kN.

SPE3FTDZ,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118351,Variation in resin flow among Maritime pine populations: Relationship with growth potential and climatic responses,"Pine trees produce large amounts of oleoresin to defend against biotic threats. Resin is highly costly to produce and investment in its production must be accurately optimized in relation to allocation to other life functions such growth. As a result of these costs, resin production is highly variable both genetically (among and within species) and plastically (across temporal and spatial environmental heterogeneity). The relative contribution of these sources of variation is, however, far from being completely understood. Besides being a main defensive mechanism, pine resin is also a valuable non-timber forest product that is regaining attention as a renewable resource for different industrial sectors. Improving our knowledge on the main drivers of resin production is vital to fine-tune resin-tapping management, especially in regions with little tradition in resin-tapping such are the Atlantic areas of the Iberian Peninsula. Here, we assessed resin flow and growth in a network of seven Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) provenance tests established in North West Spain to explore the within species variation in resin flow, the plasticity of resin flow across sites and across the season and the (phenotypic and genotypic) relationships between resin flow and tree growth. Resin flow was assessed in three contrasting Maritime pine populations at three times within the season using a micro-tapping procedure that predicts well the resin yield potential for exploitation purposes. Results supported the theoretical predictions as resin flow significantly varied among populations, with populations from more favorable environmental conditions producing less resin than those from harsher conditions. Resin flow was positively correlated with tree size at the phenotypic level. However, the genetically-based relationship between growth potential and resin flow was markedly negative. Fast growing populations produced less resin than slow growing origins. Resin flow was also highly plastic across sites and across seasons, with resin flow consistently increasing towards the end of the growing season. Temperature and water deficit immediately before sampling emerged as main drivers of the observed variation in resin flow across sites and seasons. Results are valuable to understand the extremely large variation in defensive investment on resin-based defenses in conifer species, to model the potential of Atlantic Maritime pine forest for resin tapping, and to fine-tune the resin-tapping management of these forests. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

The Great Pacific garbage patch consisting of abandoned plastics is killing marine life. In addition, micro-plastics decomposed by solar UV radiation and waves can accumulate in the human body. Recycling plastic is accordingly a critical element of waste management. As part of the solution to this problem, factory automation in recycling plants to handle more waste faster is essential. The amount of reproduced raw plastics is proportional to the inlet speed of the plastics waste stream into a recycling process line. Furthermore, the quality of recycled products with reproduced raw plastics depends on the sorting purity through the line. Thus, an automated system should be capable of real-time classification of the plastics category and rapid manipulation for removing selected plastics. We propose a real-time sorting system for mixed color plastics by applying a machine learning algorithm and a parallel manipulator with a vacuum suction pad.

Although extensive research has been conducted in recent years on microplastic pollution in river sediments, knowledge on the relationships between potential influential factors such as catchment characteristics and sediment properties, and microplastics occurrence in river sediments, is still considered an under-researched area. This study evaluated the influence of land use, population, and sediment particle size on the presence of microplastics abundance and types. Based on a Bayesian Network modelling approach to characterise the correlations between influencing factors and microplastics occurrence, it was evident that microplastics type had a positive correlation with different land use types and population. Catchment characteristics were found to play a more important role in influencing microplastics type than microplastics concentration. A statistically significant positive relationship was observed between microplastics concentration and clay particles which suggested that the occurrence of microplastics in sediments can be impacted by the presence of clay particles. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
UV3LX6GP,10.7717/peerj.9808,"The phylogenetics of Teleosauroidea (Crocodylomorpha, Thalattosuchia) and implications for their ecology and evolution","Teleosauroidea was a clade of ancient crocodylomorphs that were a key element of coastal marine environments during the Jurassic. Despite a 300-year research history and a recent renaissance in the study of their morphology and taxonomy, macroevolutionary studies of teleosauroids are currently limited by our poor understanding of their phylogenetic interrelationships. One major problem is the genus Steneosaurus, a wastebasket taxon recovered as paraphyletic or polyphyletic in phylogenetic analyses. We constructed a newly updated phylogenetic data matrix containing 153 taxa (27 teleosauroids, eight of which were newly added) and 502 characters, which we analysed under maximum parsimony using TNT 1.5 (weighted and unweighted analyses) and Bayesian inference using MrBayes v3.2.6 (standard, gamma and variation). The resulting topologies were then analysed to generate comprehensive higher-level phylogenetic hypotheses of teleosauroids and shed light on species-level interrelationships within the clade. The results from our parsimony and Bayesian analyses are largely consistent. Two large subclades within Teleosauroidea are recovered, and they are morphologically, ecologically and biogeographically distinct from one another. Based on comparative anatomical and phylogenetic results, we propose the following major taxonomic revisions to Teleosauroidea: (1) redefining Teleosauridae; (2) introducing one new family and three new subfamilies; (3) the resurrection of three historical genera; and (4) erecting seven new generic names and one new species name. The phylogeny infers that the Laurasian subclade was more phenotypically plastic overall than the Sub-Boreal- Gondwanan subclade. The proposed phylogeny shows that teleosauroids were more diverse than previously thought, in terms of morphology, ecology, dispersal and abundance, and that they represented some of the most successful crocodylomorphs during the Jurassic. ?? 2020 Johnson et al.",

Several rivers in the Manila metropolitan area are assumed to be main pathways of land-based plastic waste into the ocean. However, these model estimates remain uncertain due to a lack of field data. The main goal of this study was therefore to collect field data on floating macroplastic flux and polymer category in three of Manila's main rivers: the Meycauayan, Tullahan and Pasig. We measured plastic flux, item polymer category, and flow velocity at two locations per river during an 11-day period. Each river was measured close to the river mouth, and several kilometer upstream. The results showed no significant difference between the plastic flux in upstream and downstream flow direction at the three river mouths. The Meycauayan and Pasig rivers did have significantly higher plastic flux at the river mouth compared to the upstream location. The observations suggest accumulation of macroplastics in the river mouths during periods of low freshwater discharge. In this case, instantaneous plastic flux is mainly determined by the tidal dynamics. It is hypothesized that plastics are temporarily retained in estuaries, and may be flushed out during neap tide or increased river discharge. Due to the retention capacity of the estuaries, net plastic export into the ocean could not be estimated. Future research is needed to further investigate the role of tidal dynamics on the transport and net export of riverine macroplastics. ??

QLC7CCES,10.1021/acsami.0c13876,Superhydrophobic and Sustainable Nanostructured Powdered Iron for the Efficient Separation of Oil-in-Water Emulsions and the Capture of Microplastics,"The pollution of oceans and seas by oils and microplastics is a significant global issue affecting the economy and environment. Therefore, it is necessary to search for different technologies that can remove these pollutants in a sustainable way. Herein, superhydrophobic powdered iron was used to efficiently separate stabilized oil-in-water emulsions and, remarkably, capture microplastic fibers. High-energy ball milling of iron particles was applied to decrease particle size, increase the specific surface area, and produce a nanostructured material. This was combined with the liquid phase deposition of lauric acid to modify the surface free energy. The nanostructured powder showed superhydrophobicity (WCA = 154??) and superoleophilicity (OCA = 0??), which were fundamental in separating stabilized oil-in-water emulsions of hexane with an efficiency close to 100%. Because of the superhydrophobic/superoleophilic properties of the powdered iron and its intrinsic properties of being able to freely move and adapt to the different morphologies of microplastics under continuous stirring, this material can capture microplastic fibers. Thus, we present a novel dual application of a superhydrophobic material, which includes the capture of microplastics. This has not been reported previously and provides a new scope for future environmental sustainability. Copyright ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",
RXX36YEH,10.1021/acs.est.0c01984,Closing the Mediterranean Marine Floating Plastic Mass Budget: Inverse Modeling of Sources and Sinks,"Estimates of plastic inputs into the ocean are orders of magnitude larger than what is found in the surface waters. This can be due to discrepancies in the sources of plastic released into the ocean but can also be explained by the fact that it is not well-known what the most dominant sinks of marine plastics are and on what time scales these operate. To get a better understanding on possible sources and sinks, an inverse modeling methodology is presented here for a Lagrangian ocean model, estimating floating plastic quantities in the Mediterranean Sea. Field measurements of plastic concentrations in the Mediterranean are used to inform parametrizations defining various sources of marine plastics and removal of plastic particles because of beaching and sinking. The parameters of the model are found using inverse modeling, by comparison of model results and measurements of floating plastic concentrations. Time scales for the sinks are found, and likely sources of plastics can be ranked in importance. A new mass balance is made for floating plastics in the Mediterranean: for 2015, there is an estimated input of 2100-3400 tonnes, and of plastics released since 2006, about 170-420 tonnes remain afloat in the surface waters, 49-63% ended up on coastlines, and 37-51% have sunk down.

KJCFPSVC,10.1021/acs.est.0c02715,Bioavailability of Microplastics to Marine Zooplankton: Effect of Shape and Infochemicals,"The underlying mechanisms that influence microplastic ingestion in marine zooplankton remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how microplastics of a variety of shapes (bead, fiber, and fragment), in combination with the algal-derived infochemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), affect the ingestion rate of microplastics in three species of zooplankton, the copepods Calanus helgolandicus and Acartia tonsa and larvae of the European lobster Homarus gammarus. We show that shape affects microplastic bioavailability to different species of zooplankton, with each species ingesting significantly more of a certain shape: C. helgolandicus - fragments (P < 0.05); A. tonsa - fibers (P < 0.01); H. gammarus larvae - beads (P < 0.05). Thus, different feeding strategies between species may affect shape selectivity. Our results also showed significantly increased ingestion rates by C. helgolandicus on all microplastics that were infused with DMS (P < 0.01) and by H. gammarus larvae and A. tonsa on DMS-infused fibers and fragments (P < 0.05). By using a range of more environmentally relevant microplastics, our findings highlight how the feeding strategies of different zooplankton species may influence their susceptibility to microplastic ingestion. Furthermore, our novel study suggests that species reliant on chemosensory cues to locate their prey may be at an increased risk of ingesting aged microplastics in the marine environment.

DRTGA2A3,10.1021/acs.est.0c02305,Marine Plastic Debris: A New Surface for Microbial Colonization,"Plastics become rapidly colonized by microbes when released into marine environments. This microbial community - the Plastisphere - has recently sparked a multitude of scientific inquiries and generated a breadth of knowledge, which we bring together in this review. Besides providing a better understanding of community composition and biofilm development in marine ecosystems, we critically discuss current research on plastic biodegradation and the identification of potentially pathogenic ""hitchhikers""in the Plastisphere. The Plastisphere is at the interface between the plastic and its surrounding milieu, and thus drives every interaction that this synthetic material has with its environment, from ecotoxicity and new links in marine food webs to the fate of the plastics in the water column. We conclude that research so far has not shown Plastisphere communities to starkly differ from microbial communities on other inert surfaces, which is particularly true for mature biofilm assemblages. Furthermore, despite progress that has been made in this field, we recognize that it is time to take research on plastic-Plastisphere-environment interactions a step further by identifying present gaps in our knowledge and offering our perspective on key aspects to be addressed by future studies: (I) better physical characterization of marine biofilms, (II) inclusion of relevant controls, (III) study of different successional stages, (IV) use of environmentally relevant concentrations of biofouled microplastics, and (V) prioritization of gaining a mechanistic and functional understanding of Plastisphere communities.

MX84D49K,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122794,A new digestion approach for the extraction of microplastics from gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) of the common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) from the western Mediterranean Sea,"Plastic ingestion is one of the main impacts of marine litter on organisms. The occurrence of microplastics (MPs &lt; 5 mm) in the stomachs of Mediterranean species was already reported in several studies. In this context, the present study aims to develop a new approach of digestion for the identification of MPs in the gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) of marine organisms. The new approach combines two digestion protocols, including potassium hydroxide (KOH) and nitric acid (HNO3), to remove most organic and inorganic materials. This digestion allows recording small MPs that are difficult to find via routinely stomach content analysis and also to minimize the overestimation of the phenomenon trough the control of airborne contamination. The new approach was tested on a voracious pelagic opportunistic predator, the common dolphinfish, a fishery resource exploited in several Mediterranean areas. The results showed that a large amount of ingested meso- and microplastics, such as fragments or sheets, was recorded in GITs (F = 65.5 %). The FTIR analysis on litter samples allowed to identify polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene as dominant constituent polymers of microplastics. These results confirmed that our novel combined digestion protocol represents a reliable approach to detect MPs in opportunistic pelagic predators. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
SVZWRCBI,10.3389/fmars.2020.576170,Microplastic Pollution in Deep-Sea Sediments From the Great Australian Bight,"Interest in understanding the extent of plastic and specifically microplastic pollution has increased on a global scale. However, we still know relatively little about how much plastic pollution has found its way into the deeper areas of the world?€?s oceans. The extent of microplastic pollution in deep-sea sediments remains poorly quantified, but this knowledge is imperative for predicting the distribution and potential impacts of global plastic pollution. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified microplastics in deep-sea sediments from the Great Australian Bight using an adapted density separation and dye fluorescence technique. We analyzed sediment cores from six locations (1?€?6 cores each, n = 16 total samples) ranging in depth from 1,655 to 3,062 m and offshore distances ranging from 288 to 356 km from the Australian coastline. Microplastic counts ranged from 0 to 13.6 fragments per g dry sediment (mean 1.26 ?? 0.68; n = 51). We found substantially higher microplastic counts than recorded in other analyses of deep-sea sediments. Overall, the number of microplastic fragments in the sediment increased as surface plastic counts increased, and as the seafloor slope angle increased. However, microplastic counts were highly variable, with heterogeneity between sediment cores from the same location greater than the variation across sampling sites. Based on our empirical data, we conservatively estimate 14 million tonnes of microplastic reside on the ocean floor. ??

However, none is known regarding the interaction of these two important issues. The Yellow Sea suffers the world's largest green tides and severe MPs pollution as well. Therefore, we tracked the trapping of MPs by drifting Ulva prolifera in the Yellow Sea during the green-tide period. The abundance of MPs in drifting U. prolifera was 595?€?3917 times higher than that in seawater and increased along the drifting path from south to north in the Yellow Sea. In addition, four mechanisms of trapping plastics (twining, attachment, embedment, and wrapping) on or in U. prolifera were unmasked, which explains why the plant has such strong capacity to trap MPs. Laboratory incubation experiments showed that MPs (0.025?€?25 mg L???1) did not affect relative growth rate, effective photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), or saturating irradiance of U. prolifera until reaching an extremely high concentration (100 mg L???1), indicating a high tolerance to MPs. Due to tremendous biomass and coverage of the green tide and increased frequency as well, the plastics trap in drifting macroalgae can alter the spatio-temporal distribution of MPs in the oceans. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Micro-polystyrene particles have been proved to accumulate in vivo and caused disorders of digestion, antioxidant system, immunity and intestinal microflora, but little is known about the effects of nano-polystyrene (nano-PS). In order to understand response mechanism of marine fish to nano-PS, the effects of nanoplastics on the intestinal health and growth performance of the juvenile Larimichthys crocea were investigated. After 14-d exposure, the reduced digestive enzyme activities indicated that nano-PS had a negative impact on the digestion and absorption of juvenile fish. Moreover, analysis of the intestinal microbiota showed that the proportion of the three-dominant bacterial phyla (Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes) in the gut changed significantly, accompanied by a significant increase of potentially pathogenic bacteria (Parabacteroides and Alistipes). In addition, lysozyme activity and specific growth rate (SGR) were significantly reduced, and total mortality of juvenile fish was significantly increased. Overall, nano-PS exposure was harmful for the health of juvenile fish, which might threaten their population in the long term. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

In this study, marine medaka was used to explore the individual and combined toxicity of heavy metals (HMs) and MPs on intestinal bacteria and gonadal development. After exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of MPs and HMs, significant alterations of intestinal microbiota were found. The MPs treatment reduced the diversity and abundance of intestinal microbiota, while the HMs and MPs-HMs treatments increased them, which were confirmed by the abundance changes of Proteobacteria. According to the KEGG analysis, the metabolism and environmental information processing (EIP) pathways in the microbial community were significantly affected. This study showed that the MPs-HMs treatment caused a higher pollution load on the gut of the marine medaka, and triggered more significant changes of specific bacterial species and gut function in the males. However, during the gonadal development, HMs and MPs-HMs treatments resulted in empty follicles (EF) and follicular atresia (FA), and altered the gene expression levels related to hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In short, this study demonstrated that the reproductive disturbance was mainly due to HMs, but the combination of MPs and HMs did not strengthen the risk to the gonad development of the marine medaka. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
ZQ76DUMH,10.3390/su12208677,The marine plastic litter issue: A social-economic analysis,"The issue of marine plastic litter pollution is multifaceted, cross-sectoral, and ongoing in the absence of appropriate management measures. This study analysed the issue of marine plastic litter pollution in the context of the Descriptor 10 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Good Environmental Status of the oceans and seas. The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was used to assess the causes, effects, and management measures to changes in the marine environment resulting from marine plastics pollution. We noted that less than 10 peer-reviewed publications have applied the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model to the issue of marine plastics pollution. Some basic needs such as food security, movement of goods and services, and shelter are also some of the major drivers of marine plastic pollution. The use of plastics is linked to multiple economic sectors (fisheries, agriculture, transport, packaging, construction) and other human activities. A significant amount of the resulting pressures came from the economic sectors for packaging and construction. State changes occurred at the environmental (contamination and bioaccumulation), ecosystem (ingestion of plastics, ghost fishing) and ecosystem service levels (supply of sea food, salt and cultural benefits), with possible loss of jobs and income being some of the observed impacts on human welfare. Responses as management measures, which are tailored to meet each component of the DPSIR framework, were identified. These included policies, regulations, technological advancement and behavioural change. The research acknowledges the issue of marine plastics pollution as a global environmental problem and recommends a trans-disciplinary approach, involving all types of stakeholders. Future research and analysis applying the DPSIR framework will be useful to provide the information necessary for the effective, adaptive management of litter pollution by marine plastics. ?? 2020 by the authors.

In this paper, we used scientometric analysis to understand the current status of microplastic research in terrestrial systems. The global scientific literature on microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems, based on data from the Web of Science between 1986 and 2020, was explored with the VOSviewer scientometric software. Co-occurrence visualization maps and citation analysis were used to identify the relationship among keywords, authors, organizations, countries, and journals focusing on the issues of terrestrial microplastics. The results show that research on microplastics in terrestrial systems just started in the past few years but is increasing rapidly. Science of the Total Environment ranks first among the journals publishing papers on terrestrial microplastics. In addition, we also highlighted the desire to establish standards/protocols for extracting and quantifying microplastics in soils.

At three sites on the coast of Par??, Brazil, anemones were collected from beachrocks in the intertidal zone (30 at each site), measured (pedal disc diameter, mm) and weighed (wet weight, g). The contents of the gastrovascular cavity were extracted and analyzed under a stereoscope. The recovered plastic particles were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Overall, 139 microplastic and 2 mesoplastic items were identified in 68 individuals (75.6%) among the 90 examined, with a mean of 1.6 (??1.5) items per individual. Plastic fibers comprised about 84% of the ingested plastics, followed by fragments (???12%) and films (???4%). Particle diameters ranged from 0.10 to 9.17 mm (1.57 ?? 1.23 mm). A weak positive correlation was found between the weight of anemones and the number of plastic particles in the gastrovascular cavity (p = 0.03) and between the number of prey items and the number of plastic particles in the gastrovascular cavity (p < 0.01). The main polymers identified by FTIR analysis were polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), polyurethane (PU), polyethylene (PE), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polystyrene (PS) and rayon. Sea anemones ingested significantly more plastic debris at the most urbanized and populous sampling sites. This study provides the first evidence of microplastics contamination of marine invertebrates from the Amazon coast. Abundant species such as B. cangicum have the potential to monitor the levels of plastic contamination in the region. Our results support this potential, as the species showed a high frequency of plastic ingestion and allowed detection of plastic contamination even in the best-preserved area where anemones were collected. Bunodosoma cangicum showed a high frequency of microplastic ingestion and was able to indicate contamination even in a conservation unit, supporting its potential as a biomonitor. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species of Southern Ocean pelagic ecosystems, which plays a central role in the Antarctic food webs and carbon (C) cycle. Krill has been shown to rapidly fragment microplastic beads through the digestive system, releasing nanoplastics with unknown toxicological effects. Here we exposed krill juveniles to carboxylic (?€?COOH, anionic) and amino- (?€?NH2, cationic) polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) and we investigated lethal and sub-lethal endpoints after 48 h. The analysis of PS NP suspensions in Antarctic sea water (SW) media showed that PS-COOH formed large agglomerates (1043 ?? 121 nm), while PS-NH2 kept their nominal size (56.8 ?? 3 nm) during the exposure time. After 48 h, no mortality was found but increase in exuviae production (12.6 ?? 1.3%) and reduced swimming activity were observed in juveniles exposed to PS-NH2. The microbial community composition in SW supports the release of krill moults upon PS NP exposure and stimulates further research on the pivotal role of krill in shaping Southern Ocean bacterial assemblages. The presence of fluorescent signal in krill faecal pellets (FPs) confirmed the waterborne ingestion and egestion of PS-COOH at 48 h of exposure. Changes in FP structure and properties were also associated to the incorporation of PS NPs regardless of their surface charge. The effects of PS NPs on krill FP properties were compared to Control 0 h as a reference for full FPs (plastic vs food) and Control 48 h as a reference for more empty-like FPs (plastic vs lack of food). Exposure to PS NPs led to a FP sinking rate comparable to Control 48 h, but significantly lower than Control 0 h (58.40 ?? 23.60 m/d and 51.23 ?? 28.60 m/d for PS-COOH and PS-NH2; 168.80 ?? 74.58 m/d for Control 0 h).

Yet, few studies have documented the impact of microplastic ingestion to aquatic organisms. In the Pacific Northwest, Chinook salmon are a culturally and commercially significant fish species. The presence of marine and freshwater microplastic pollution is well documented in Chinook salmon habitat, yet no research has investigated the impacts to salmon from microplastic ingestion. The majority of the marine microplastics found in the Salish Sea are microfibers, synthetic extruded polymers that come from commonly worn clothing. To understand the potential impacts of microfiber ingestion to fish, we ran a feeding experiment with juvenile Chinook salmon to determine if ingested fibers are retained or digestion rates altered over a 10 day digestion period. The experiment was completed in two trials, each consisted of 20 control and 20 treatment fish. Treatment fish were each fed an amended ration of 12 food pellets spiked with 20 polyester microfibers and control fish were fed the same ration without added microfibers. Fish were sampled at day 0, 3, 5, 7, and 10 to assess if fibers were retained in their gastrointestinal tract and to determine the rate of digestion. Fibers for the experiment came from washing a red polyester fleece jacket in a microfiber retention bag. Fibers had a mean length of 4.98 mm. Results showed fish were able to clear up to 94% of fed fibers over 10 days. Differences in mean gastrointestinal mass were not statistically significant at any sampled time between treatment and controls, suggesting that the ingestion of microfibers did not alter digestion rates. Further work is needed to understand if repeated exposures, expected in the environment, alter digestion or food assimilation for growth. ?? 2020",

Based on the REE patterns of SWEs, beached plastics and modern corals, we demonstrated that nanoplastics are important components in the REE signature of coastal sand (29 to 73%). These original results demonstrate the relevance of developing geochemical tracers for determining the fate of missing plastic litter. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
JYFLFGGC,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111507,Comparison of microplastic isolation and extraction procedures from marine sediments,"Microplastics (MPs) are small (<5 mm) plastic particles which pose a threat to marine ecosystems. Identifying MPs is crucial for understanding their fate and effects. Many MP extraction methods exist, but procedural differences prevent meaningful comparisons across datasets. This method comparison examines the efficiency of five methods for extracting MPs (40?€?710 ??m) from marine sediments. Known quantities of MPs were spiked into sediments. The MPs were extracted and enumerated to demonstrate percent recovery. Findings determined that sediment matrix, MP properties, and extraction method affect the percent recovery of MPs from sediments. Average recoveries of spiked microplastics were between 0 and 87.4% and varied greatly by sediment type, microplastic, and method of extraction. In general, larger particle and lower density MPs were more effectively recovered. Marine sediments low in organic matter and with larger grain size also had higher percent recoveries of MPs. These findings support the need for method optimization and unified procedures. ?? 2020",

Concentrations were significantly higher in tube-dwelling polychaetes than sediments from the same locations (p&lt;0.0097) by orders of magnitude. To quantify this factor increase in polychaetes, a Biota-Sediment Particle Enrichment Factor (BSPEF) is introduced, which ranged from 100 to 11000 gdw/gww (280?€?31000 gdw/gdw). Higher microplastic levels were observed in polychaete tube than in soft tissue (n=4).

Cellulosic material, like chitin, however, are a type of NOM that is resistant to chemical digestion, and difficult to eliminate from samples. To address this, a two-step digestion method was developed to remove or reduce cellulosic materials in diverse marine media. This method was applied to reference microplastics, reference cellulosic materials, and diverse marine samples from the Inner Oslofjord Norway. This included plankton, seabed sediments near a water treatment plant and driftline sand. The method was developed and tested for plastic particles &gt;45 ??m. The first-step was to pre-dissolve cellulosic materials using a mixture of urea:thiourea:NaOH. This was followed by an oxidative digestion step, here using H2O2 and NaOH. Most reference plastics were unaffected, except minor effects for PET and nylon. After sufficient repetitions, cellulosic materials in both reference and marine samples were largely removed. This method was compared to other digestion methods used for microplastic quantification, including single-step oxidation, alkaline treatment, acid treatment and enzymatic treatment. The results indicate that the pre-dissolution step greatly facilitates NOM and cellulosic material digestion for the purpose of microplastic quantification. ?? 2020 The Authors",

HZWZM3IH,10.3390/w12102802,"Towards characterising microplastic abundance, typology and retention in mangrove-dominated estuaries","Plastic and, particularly, microplastic (MP) pollution is a growing research theme, dedicated largely to marine systems. Occurring at the land?€?sea interface, estuarine habitats such as mangroves are at risk of plastic pollution. This study compared MP pollution (level, morphotype, polymer composition, size and colour) across four South African estuaries, in relation to the built and natural environment. Mouth status, surrounding human population densities and land-use practices influenced the level and type of MP pollution. Systems that were most at risk were predominantly open estuaries surrounded by high population densities and diverse land use types. Microplastic levels and the diversity of types detected increased with increasing levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Overall, microfibres dominated in estuarine water (69%) and mangrove sediment (51%). Polyethylene (43%) and polypropylene (23%) were the dominant polymers overall. Weathered fishing gear, weathered packaging items and run-off from urban/industrial centres are probable sources of MP pollution. Increased run-off and river input during the wet/rainy season may explain the markedly higher MP loads in estuarine waters relative to the dry season. By contrast, MP deposition in mangrove sediment was higher during the dry season. Sediment MP abundance was significantly positively correlated with both pneumatophore density and sediment size (500?€?2000 ??m). This study highlights the role of mangroves as MP sinks, which may limit movement of MPs into adjacent environments. However, under conditions such as flooding and extreme wave action, mangroves may shift from sinks to sources of plastic pollution. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

To the south of the Antarctic Polar Front, microplastics are present mainly west to the Antarctic Peninsula, but information is scarce about their impact on the pelagic food web. Here, we analysed 42 scats of male Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) collected in late summer at Deception Island (South Shetland Islands), which allowed us to assess the presence of microplastics in the pelagic food web of the Bransfield Strait (Western Antarctica). Furthermore, we analysed the hard remains of prey in the scats to characterize the diet of fur seals. Hard remains recovered from the scats revealed that male Antarctic fur seals foraged on krill and myctophid fishes during late summer. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) revealed that none of the seven fragments and three fibres recovered from their scats were microplastics, but rather were silicate minerals and chitin.

Bead presence in the digestive diverticula and defense responses in the digestive diverticula and hemolymph were measured at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days. The activity and expression of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and H2O2 in the digestive diverticula and/or hemolymph of scallops increased with microplastic concentration and exposure duration. These results suggest that microplastics can accumulate in the digestive diverticula of A. irradians, and that exposure to microplastics induces oxidative stress in bivalves. It is likely that exposure to high concentrations of micro- or nano-sized plastic particles could potentially have adverse effects in bivalves. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",

Nevertheless, freshwater systems are worthy to be equally investigated as they are pathways of plastic to the ocean and lakes may act as (temporary) sinks. The aim of this study was to identify sources for plastics and influences on its distribution in a limnic environment. Anthropogenic litter (&gt;5 mm) was monitored semi-annually over a three-year period at four sandy bank border segments of Lake Tollense in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. The selected beaches represent different expositions and vary in their level of anthropogenic activity. Considering all six samplings, mean abundance of anthropogenic litter is 0.2 ?? 0.1 items/m2 or 130.9 ?? 91.0 items/100 m beach length.

What bottles tell us about the origins of beach litter in Kenya,"Identifying the source of marine litter is essential to design effective mitigation measures to reduce plastic leakage into marine ecosystems. Kenya recently banned the use of polyethylene bags, but PET drink bottles remain a contentious source of litter in the country. I collected bottles and other single-use containers at nine Kenyan beaches, and compared their composition, country of manufacture and approximate age (time since manufacture) to bottles collected in coastal towns. Locally manufactured bottles dominated street litter (98%) and on urban beaches (93%) but became increasingly uncommon with distance from coastal towns, comprising only 30% of bottles at remote beaches. These steep spatial gradients indicate that most local bottles do not disperse far from source areas. The presence of lids is important for long-distance dispersal of glass and PET bottles, and many PET bottles littered in urban areas lack lids. HDPE bottles are much more common on beaches than on streets, and most come from Indonesia. The presence of epibionts and bite marks suggest that most HDPE bottles have drifted in the South Equatorial Current from southeast Asia, whereas foreign PP bottles mostly come from Indian Ocean island states. Reducing plastic leakage in southeast Asia should reduce the amount of beach litter throughout the western Indian Ocean. Some foreign PET bottles come from neighbouring states, but many are probably dumped illegally from ships operating from Asia. In addition to reducing plastic leakage from land-based sources, we need to ensure compliance with MARPOL Annex V regulations banning the disposal of plastic wastes at sea. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

We applied a risk assessment framework to explore the relative risk for 19 marine bird species posed by plastic debris in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We estimated exposure for each species by combining scores from (1) spatial overlap of predicted marine bird densities from habitat-association models and predicted density of marine plastics from terrestrial input and ocean circulation models, (2) species' foraging behavior, and (3) species' residence time in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We estimated sensitivity for each species by combining scores for (1) mortality/sub-lethal effects of ingested plastic debris, (2) off-loading of plastics via regurgitation, (3) fecundity, and (4) age of breeding maturity. Overall risk from marine debris was greatest for more pelagic species and lowest for nearshore coastal species and generally agreed with published plastic ingestion studies. Notably, marine plastic debris densities are greatest at the western edge and offshore of the study domain, which likely explains the greater risk we observed in more pelagic species. This study is the first to look specifically at plastic debris risk to marine birds in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, and our results suggest that any attempts to mitigate the impacts of plastic debris on marine birds will likely require assessment and actions beyond the California Current into the broader Pacific basin. ?? 2020",

The present study was aimed at adding to current knowledge by verifying if, and to what extent, embryogenesis in the sea urchin species Paracentrotus lividus is adversely affected by polystyrene and polymethylmethacrylate virgin microparticles over a size range 1?€?230 ??m and at concentrations of 0.1?€?10 mg L???1. Developing embryos which came in contact with the microplastics only after fertilisation did not display a significant increase of developmental defects. Unlike embryo exposures, when P. lividus sperm were exposed to the microplastics or their leachates, modest, yet significant effects were observed, both in terms of decreased fertilisation rate and increase of transmissible damage to offspring. Further, it was noted that larvae more readily ingested polymethylmethacrylate than polystyrene microparticles after 3 days which may represent a route for enhancing the toxicity of the former compared to the latter. Overall, these findings provide evidence for lesser sensitivity of P. lividus early life stages to microplastics compared to other urchins such as Sphaerechinus granularis. In turn, the more robust response of P. lividus highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate test species with the highest sensitivity when investigating mildly harmful materials. ?? 2020",

Trophic exposure in fish sensitive early life stages,"The present study evaluated very small microplastic particle (MPs) transfer to zebrafish and marine medaka larvae via prey experimentally exposed to MPs from the onset of feeding. Larvae were fed Paramecium or Artemia nauplii loaded with fluorescent 1?€?5 or 10?€?20 ??m MP. Pollutant accumulation was analyzed by optically tracking of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and recording cyp1a transcription. Paramecium transferred 1?€?5 ??m particles only, whereas Artemia efficiently transferred both MPs. Although zebrafish and medaka larvae fed from the onset of active food intake (2?€?3 dph, respectively) on Paramecium and from days 6?€?7 post-hatch on Artemia nauplii, neither MP accumulation nor translocation to tissues was detected. MP egestion started within few hours after ingestion. Cyp1a induction and fluorescent analyses proved BaP bioavailability after transfer via Paramecium and Artemia. Unicellular or plankton organisms ingest contaminants via MPS and transfer effectively these to sensitive early life-stages of vertebrates, giving rise to whole-life exposure. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
SGF7WXM3,10.1007/s11367-020-01802-z,Life cycle impact assessment of microplastics as one component of marine plastic debris,"Purpose: Plastic pollution in marine environments is a severe problem in the world due to misuse and mismanagement of the materials. Microplastics are a specific form of pollutants in this context and its handling is very difficult due to its very small size of particulates. Currently, the impacts of marine plastic debris are not considered. However, this type of particulates can be assessed like other emissions with the systematic and quantifiable approach in life cycle assessment (LCA). It was our goal to find and test first methodological approaches for including impacts of marine litter of microplastics to LCA. Methods: The Medellin Declaration on Marine Litter in Life Cycle Assessment and Management raised this issue in 2017 and called for LCA to address the challenges of marine litter. The present research paper focuses on how to integrate plastic debris impacts with focus on microplastics into LCA and gives a suggestion for an assessment approach. Based on a literature review, we considered various impacts to the marine environment of microplastics linked with their kinetics of the fragmentation and degradation. Subsequently, we developed a characterization LCA model for microplastics in the marine environment. We addressed therein the fate of microplastics and their specific eco-toxic effects to different organisms. We compared the impacts of different types of polymers as well and showed how these can be integrated in an assessment using the new characterization model. Results and discussion: The assessment of marine litter impacts in LCA was strongly dependent on the number of microplastic particles produced from the original litter over time. These impacts were derived from measurements of the number of microparticles, their densities in the marine environment and their impacts to different organisms. The new characterization model includes the relationship between fragmentation and degradation and can be used for impact assessments within LCA. Conclusion: The question where we did not find a finally satisfying solution is the issue of the length of the time horizon of the assessment or the discounting. Those are regarded as subjective and are encountered with sensitivity or scenario analysis. Results from different time horizons can be aggregated to one figure or can be compared separately. Further investigations should be taken for a better understanding of this issue and for concrete solutions because their influence on the results of life cycle assessments is often fundamental. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

To obtain accurate measurements of MPs in the marine sediments is important for understanding its effects and potential risks to the environment. In this study, we developed a novel method for extracting MPs from sediments by density flotation of sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4) solution, which utilized the heating-assisted to increase the density of separation solution. It features high density, nontoxic, and economic, indicating its promising application in the MPs extraction. A standard procedure based on NaH2PO4 for extracting MPs from sediments was established and validated by the recovery experiments of seven common plastics. Results showed NaH2PO4 solution exhibited higher recovery rates than the commonly-used NaCl solution; three plastics with high density couldn't be recovered by NaCl, while NaH2PO4 was available for all the studied MPs. A large number of real beach samples was collected and validated by this method, and the abundance and characteristic of the collected MPs were further analyzed. Results exhibited the heating-assisted NaH2PO4 could be a promising way for extracting MPs in environmental samples. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Milne Edwards, 1853). The gills, gastric mill and intestine of 94 C. maenas and 41 E. sinensis were examined. Crabs were sampled periodically (ca. every three months) between December 2018 and October 2019. A total of 874 plastics were recovered, ranging 34 ??m?€?34 mm in length. Overall, 71.3% and 100% of C. maenas and E. sinensis, respectively, contained at least one item (fibre, film, fragment or tangle of fibres) in the gill chamber, gastric mill or gastrointestinal tract. The most common items were fibres (78.5%) but in some cases, particularly in the gastric mill, these were aggregated into tangles (7.8%). Almost all E. sinensis contained tangles of fibres (95.1%), whereas, relatively few C. maenas contained similar tangles (10.6%). ?? 2020 The Authors",

Results of the direct Monte Carlo simulation are shown to reproduce well the data of laboratory experiments. Distributions of MPs by size and density appear to be more valuable for the final terminal velocity distribution compared to the influence of the distribution by shape. The most ?€?real?€? of the simulated distributions of the terminal velocity of MPs particles in the ocean has a multimodal shape, slightly different for fresh and saline waters. Multimodality arises from the fact that the terminal velocity depends on several physical parameters simultaneously and thus should be an expected feature of MPs terminal velocity distribution. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Limited evidence exists that document effectiveness of these legislative bans on curbing plastic marine pollution in Africa. In May 2019, the Nigerian government passed the Plastic Bags Prohibition Bill (Bill) which proposed to prohibit the use, manufacture and importation of all plastic bags used for commercial and household packaging. The Bill proposed by the Nigerian government mirrors punitive legislation prevalent elsewhere across Africa. Legislative tools used internationally were compared to the proposed Nigerian Bill and limitations identified. We highlight how the Bill can be redrafted to reflect national policy to improve ocean management. Redrafting the Bill should include proactive measures, such as market-based instruments, proper planning, coordination, implementation and enforcement before final enactment into law. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

We report temporal variation in the characteristics of marine litter regurgitated by albatrosses and giant petrels on sub-Antarctic Marion Island between 1996 and 2018. Both fishery and other litter peaked during the height of the Patagonian toothfish fishery around the island (1997?€?1999). Comparing the two subsequent decades of reduced fishing effort (1999?€?2008 and 2009?€?2018), fishing litter decreased while other litter increased across all species. Litter increased most in grey-headed albatrosses, followed by giant petrels and wandering albatrosses. Similar ranked responses were found in the same species at South Georgia, but non-fishery-related litter has increased faster in the Indian Ocean than the southwest Atlantic, indicating regional changes in litter growth rates. These seabirds' regurgitations provide an easy, non-invasive way to track changes in oceanic litter in a remote area that is otherwise difficult to monitor. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In this study, the presence of MP in stuffed mussels sold in 5 Turkish cities was examined. The microplastic content of ready-to-eat stuffed mussels purchased from 41 different vendors in 5 different cities was studied using chemical digestion, density separation, and ??-Raman spectroscopy. The average amount of MP in the stuffed mussels was determined as 0.6 ?? 0.1 (median = 0.6; IQR = 0.7) MP mussel???1. Among the 5 cities, the highest number of MP was found in Istanbul with 0.9 ?? 0.1 MP mussel???1, while the lowest number was found in Bodrum with 0.3 ?? 0.1 MP mussel???1. The MP were identified as fiber type 62.7% and fragment type 37.3%. According to the ??-Raman analysis, the largest amounts of identified polymer types were polyethylene 35% and polypropylene 15%. Stuffed mussels purchased from 92% of the vendors contained MP. If an average consumer eats 100 g of stuffed mussels/portion, it is estimated that there is a risk of consuming 5.8 MP/portion. MP pollution is a serious problem in seafood. This study showed that stuffed mussels could be one way in which humans are exposed to MP. Due to the possible increase of MP load in the over-processing of seafood products, the results suggested that the quantification of MP should also be included as a component of food security systems. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

There is increasing concern regarding the potential toxicity of MPs to organisms at the physiological and morphological levels. However, little is known about the impact of MPs on aquatic life, despite their ubiquitous presence in freshwater ecosystems. In this study, the aquatic plant Utricularia vulgaris was exposed to 1, 2 and 5 ??m polystyrene fluorescent MP particles at concentrations of 15, 70 and 140 mg/L for 7 days. The toxic effects of MPs on the growth rate and morphological and physiological characteristics of U. vulgaris were assessed. The results showed that the relative growth rates and the functional traits of leaves (morphological and photosynthetic) were significantly inhibited at a high concentration of MP particles (140 mg/L) when compared to the control group. The impacts on growth performance were likely due to bioaccumulation of MPs in the bladders, as shown by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, the antioxidative enzyme activities showed that high concentrations of MPs induce high ecotoxicity and oxidative damage to U. vulgaris. Thus, U. vulgaris has the potential to be an excellent bioindicator of MP pollution in freshwater ecosystems and should further be applied in ecological risk assessments of the effects of MPs on higher aquatic plants. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Therefore, the impacts of exposure to BPA and MPs alone or in combination on a series of immune and neural biomarkers were investigated in the invertebrate bivalve species blood clam (Tegillarca granosa). Evident immunotoxicity as indicated by alterations in hematic indexes was observed after two weeks of exposure to BPA and MPs at environmentally realistic concentrations. The expression of four immune-related genes from the NF??B signaling pathway was also found to be significantly suppressed by the BPA and MP treatment. In addition, exposure to BPA and MPs led to an increase in the in vivo contents of three key neurotransmitters (GABA, DA, and ACh) but a decrease in the expression of genes encoding modulatory enzymes and receptors for these neurotransmitters, implying the evident neurotoxicity of BPA and MPs to blood clam. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the toxic impacts exerted by BPA were significantly aggravated by the co-presence of MPs, which may be due to interactions between BPA and MPs as well as those between MPs and clam individuals. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Rivers play a key role in transporting land-based waste towards the ocean. A large portion however is retained within river basins, for example in the estuary, in sediments and on the riverbanks. To effectively identify litter sources, sinks and transport mechanisms, reliable data are crucial. Furthermore, such data can support optimizing litter prevention mitigation and clean-up efforts. This paper presents the results of a 2-year monitoring campaign focused on riverbank macrolitter (>0.5 cm) in the Dutch Rhine-Meuse delta. Between 2017 and 2019, volunteers sampled 152 415 litter items at 212 unique locations. All items were categorized based on the River-OSPAR method (based on the OSPAR beach litter guidelines), which includes 110 specific item categories across ten parent categories. The median litter density was 2060 items/km, and the most observed items were foam, hard, and soft plastic fragments (55.8%). Plastic bottles, food wrappings and packaging, caps, lids and cotton swabs were the most abundant specific items. The litter density and most abundant items vary considerably between rivers, along the river, and over time. For both rivers however, the highest litter density values were found at the Belgian (Meuse) and German (Rhine) borders, and at the Biesbosch National Park, the most downstream location. With this paper, we aim to provide a first scientific overview of the abundance, top item categories, and spatiotemporal variation of anthropogenic litter on riverbanks in the Dutch Rhine-Meuse delta. In addition, we evaluate the used River-OSPAR method and provide suggestions for future implementation in (inter)national long-term monitoring strategies.

Additives include bisphenols, phthalates, flame retardants, and further emerging and legacy contaminants. With a few exceptions, additives are not chemically bound to the polymer, and potentially migrate within the material reaching its surface, then possibly leach out to the environment. Leachates are mixtures of additives, some of which belong to the list of emerging contaminants, i.e. substances that show the potential to pose risks to the environment and human health, while are not yet regulated. The review discusses the state of the art and gaps concerning the hidden threat of plastic leachates. The focus is on reports addressing the biological impacts of plastic leachates as a whole mixture. Degradation of plastics, including the weathering-driven fragmentation, and the release of additives, are analysed together with the techniques currently employed for chemically screening leachates. Because marine plastic litter is a major concern, the review mainly focuses on the effects of plastic leachates on marine flora and fauna. Moreover, it also addresses impacts on freshwater organisms. Finally, research needs and perspectives are examined, to promote better focused investigations, that may support developing different plastic materials and new regulations. ?? 2020",

We assessed whether various food acquisition strategies influence the observed HBI signatures. The proportion of phytoplankton to ice algae-sourced HBIs was determined through the H-Print approach that is presumed to reflect the percentage of sea ice organic carbon (iPOC) incorporated into tissues, relative to phytoplankton organic carbon. Cluster analysis separated 3 groups based on location and feeding strategy that were significantly influenced by annual sea ice persistence. Ice algae utilization was most significant in the northeast Chukchi Sea, where seasonal sea ice was present the longest. General feeding strategy was determined to be a significant factor in the degree of ice algae utilization. Predominant deposit feeders (both surface and subsurface) used more ice algae relative to suspension feeders. Organic carbon incorporated by predominant suspension feeders was primarily phytoplankton-based. The vast majority of all organisms sampled ( 90%) incorporated a measurable quantity of iPOC. Sipunculids and brittle stars had the highest relative dependence on ice algae, while other taxa displayed plastic dietary responses, including the suspension/surface deposit feeder Macoma calcarea. This study indicates that ice algae are widely utilized in Pacific Arctic benthic food webs, but most benthic organisms displayed flexibility in consuming the available food sources. The elevated utilization of ice algae by deposit feeders may prove to be a disadvantage for these organisms if they cannot adapt to the ongoing decline of iPOC as seasonal sea ice declines. ??

Here we proposed a theoretical complementary view of post-ingestion consequences, attempting to connect plastic ingestion with plastic-induced satiety. We analyzed data of plastic ingestion and dietary information of 223 immature green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from tropical Brazilian reefs in order to understand the impacts of plastic ingestion on foraging behavior. Generalized linear mixing models and permutational analysis of variance suggested that plastic accumulations in esophagus, stomach and intestine differed in their impact on green turtle's food intake. At the initial stages of plastic ingestion, where the plastic still in the stomach, an increase in food intake was observed. The accumulation of plastic in the gastrointestinal tract can reduce food intake likely leading to plastic-induced satiety. Our results also suggest that higher amounts of plastics in the gastrointestinal tract may led to underweight and emaciated turtles. We hope that adopting and refining our proposed framework will help to clarify the post-ingestion consequences of plastic ingestion in wildlife. Plastic ingestion can induce changes in behavior, increasing the food-intake at the initial stages and decreasing after its accumulation due to plastic-induced satiety, which in turn impacts animals?€? fitness. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Though ZnO and microplastics both are well known to be marine pollutants, the combined toxicity of ZnO particles with plain polystyrene (PS) microplastics are yet to be studied. Preliminary characterization of ZnO particles included examining particle size, morphology, and surface area. The amount of nominal and dissolved ions in the suspensions containing nano-sized ZnO particles was determined. The toxicity of bulk and nano-sized ZnO particles in combination with plain PS microplastics at low concentration (1 mg/ L) was assessed towards marine algae Dunaliella salina at three exposure concentrations 1.22, 12.28 and 122.88 ??M under UV-A and dark exposure conditions. As expected, a dose-dependent increment in the toxicity, ROS (extracellular & intracellular) generation and lipid peroxidation were noted for both bulk and nano-sized ZnO particles. The harmful effects of bulk and nano-sized ZnO particles were considerably reduced in the presence of plain PS microplastics. This study opens up new dimensions regarding the positive impact of microplastics at low concentration, where they lessen the toxic effects of co-pollutants in the marine ecosystem. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd.",

However, estimates of density and characteristics of debris found on beach surfaces and buried in the sand are patchy on a global scale and absent for West Africa. Here we investigate the density of surface and buried debris accumulated in two beaches with contrasting levels of urbanisation in Senegal, West Africa. We also describe type, colour, weight, size, and possible source of the 1766 items collected. The average density of debris buried at a depth of 10 cm (48.75 items/m2) was 25 times higher than that observed at the surface (1.92 items/m2). Plastics accounted for 97.62% of the items. Plastic bags and clothing plastic were the most common types, whereas white and transparent were the most common colours. Most items originated from mixed sources, i.e. beach users and land-based sources (51.30%). Debris density in the urbanised site was 20 times higher than that in the non-urbanised site. Debris density can, therefore, be largely underestimated when sampling only on the beach surface. Our study provides the first findings for future research on beach debris in Senegal. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Plankton plays an important role in marine food webs and can be used as a bioindicator to evaluate water quality and primary productivity. This study aimed to determine the community structure and abundance of zooplankton and phytoplankton at a M. alfredi feeding habitat in the Dampier Strait region of Raja Ampat, West Papua, Indonesia. Plankton samples were collected and environmental conditions were recorded during two sampling sessions, in March and in July 2017, respectively, from five M. alfredi feeding sites using a 20 ??m plankton tow net. Plankton richness was found to be higher in March (272 ind L-1??342) than in July (31 ind L-1??11), which may be due to seasonal variations in ocean current patterns in the Dampier Strait. Copepods (Phylum Arthropoda) were the dominant zooplankton found in samples in both sampling periods. Microplastics were also present in tows from both sampling periods, presenting a cause for concern regarding the large filter feeding species, including M. alfredi. ?? 2020, BIOFLUX SRL.

However, the interactions between microplastics (MPs) and crude oil, and the transfer kinetics of sorbed oil from ingested MPs into aquatic biota are largely unknown. In this study, interactions between MPs and crude oil in seawater and digestive tract mimic of aquatic biota have been examined. To mimic the living, transportation and cooking conditions of aquatic organisms, sorption and desorption behaviors were investigated under room temperature-bath (25 ??C), ice-bath (0???4 ??C) and boiling water-bath (95???100 ??C), and pH was set as 4 and 7 for the simulated gut fluid. The results showed that sorption capacity of polyethylene (PE) MPs for crude oil in seawater was higher than that in intestinal tract, indicating more oil residue in aqueous phase of gut fluid in the present of organic particles. The sorption kinetics models were well fitted to the pseudo-order model, and isotherms models were well fitted to the Freundlich model. In addition, the results demonstrated that temperature played a significant effect on crude oil viscosity, and the sorption capacity under different temperatures was in the order of 25 ??C > 95???100 ??C > 0???4 ??C, indicating that more oil was remained in aqueous phase at boiling water-bath and ice-bath. The increment of pH enhances the sorption capacities of PE MPs. Moreover, the desorption experiment has supplemented the current findings from the sorption experiments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Nevertheless, in Latin America, plastics governance is still fragmented across borders because of dispersed normative adoption and limited regional coordination. In this context, the instrumental level of articulation between the international principles of environmental law and the formal legal arrangements from the Pacific Alliance countries is assessed to analyze how this strategic platform can contribute to offering a regional response to the global problem of single use plastics. For this purpose, an illustrative case study of the national and subnational regulation developed by the Pacific Alliance and its members was performed. To this end, a framework analysis was conducted on the official legal documents from Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Ecuador. The results show extensive and scattered subnational regulation to control the consumption of plastic bags and single use plastics, with diverse policies on extended producer responsibility, educational and economic strategies to influence mainly the consumer?€?s behaviour. Recommendations are presented in order to improve plastics governance in the region through the legal component. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

The studied region is the most populated part of the lake watershed and covers the estuarine part of a large river (Shuya River), the Petrozavodsk Bay and the pelagic part of the lake. The mean MPs concentration in the sediment was 2188.7 ?? 1164.4 pieces per kg of dry weight. It is two times higher than the same in The Baltic Sea and is comparable with highly urbanized areas of the world. Possible reasons for such a high rate of MPs accumulation in Lake Onego can be due to both the proximity to their sources and accumulation behavior. MPs spatial distribution exhibited a predictable pattern along the transsection from the river mouth to pelagic waters. Fibers were the most abundant form comparing with other fractions (61 ?? 13 % of the total), however different MPs shapes prevailed in various regions. Relationship between MPs content in sediment and physical and chemical sediment characteristics was established. Fibers accumulation is related to the medium silt fraction (0.01-0.05 mm) and indicates the presence of the major accumulation zones for MPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd.",

Six beaches were sampled; an industrial site, a local and remote park and three beaches. Food packaging accounted for 66% of litter with acute levels of metals found in 10% of samples. Acute levels were independent of colour and category, but dependent on intertidal region and its anthropogenic use. Litter with acute levels of cadmium and lead were recovered from the industrial intertidal and high concentrations of zinc and cadmium associated with candy wrappers were found on recreational beaches. In addition to the intrinsic and extrinsic loads that litter carries, also too are memory effects, i.e., the previous use of the item carries over its trace metal burden posing extreme risks to marine ecosystems. In the managing of risk associated with beach litter, legacy contaminants need be considered. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
EAJWNZAX,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104132,The development of a policy framework to mitigate underwater noise pollution from commercial vessels: The role of ports,"Shipping is the most fuel-efficient type of transportation and plays a significant role in global trade. However, it has negative externalities. With the projected growth of shipping, the potential for low-frequency noise will increase along with its negative effects, such as impacts on marine species. For example, its intensity has been doubling in the North Pacific Ocean every decade for the past 60 years. Underwater noise pollution is not visible. Therefore, a scientific approach and data collection are required to raise awareness and demonstrate its negative impacts. While societal awareness in respect of other pollutants, such as oil, dangerous goods, noxious liquids substances, sewage, plastic, and air, has been raised and they have been regulated, society is not yet familiar with underwater noise pollution and, accordingly, there is no international legally binding instrument to regulate it. Ports are key interfaces between maritime transportation and land and they play a crucial role as one of the main stakeholders in the shipping industry. At the same time, this key role can be extended to cover prevention, control, mitigation, and monitoring of UWN pollution by considering appropriate policies and mitigation measures. This paper strives to identify the gaps between the potential measures and the current situation in ports and to consider multi-interdisciplinary actions by developing the concept of an Under- Water Noise Management Plan (UWNMP) within Ports. This plan is also expected to contribute to the enhancement of sustainable development along with port and ocean governance. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The impact of marine debris pollution influences life in the coastal areas including tourist areas. The coastal area of Pelabuhan Ratu in the southern part of West Java province is well-known as a tourist area. Therefore, it is vital to understand the cycle of marine debris movement in this area. We conducted research using observation data to create a Delft3D model. The coupled hydrodynamic and trajectory models were simulated to detect marine debris movement. The generating force of this model was natural forces present in the environment; i.e., tidal and wind forces, and the flow of river discharge. Plastic is the dominant type of debris. The simulation was only run during the western monsoon when there is an extremely large amount of marine debris due to the increased rainfall. The majority of marine debris particles originate from the Cimandiri River (90%) and reaches as far as the nearest estuary, which shows the role of tidal circulation. The maximum distances from the marine debris source to the furthest trajectory are 17.49 and 15.54 kms for the discontinue and continue particle source simulations, respectively. The marine debris particles which originated from the tourist beach area move westward along the coastline, following the wind direction. After reaching the area of the estuary area, some particles enter the river, but most (98%) move to the coastal area as far as the nearest estuary. ?? 2020, BIOFLUX SRL. All rights reserved.",

The environments of study were air and seawater (SW), under constant amplitude sinewave fatigue loading. Fundamentally, three phenomena (crack tip diversion, crack front bifurcation and metal crumb formation) were observed to influence the rate of FCG. These phenomena appear to be a function of the material microstructure, environment and crack tip loading conditions. The three factors retarded the crack growth by reducing or redistributing the effective driving force at the main active crack tip. A crack path containing extensively the three phenomena was observed to offer strong resistance to FCG. In SW, the degree of the electrochemical dissolution of the microplastic zone appears to be an additional primary factor influencing FCG in the steels. ?? 2020 The Authors.

A5TGPD5J,10.1371/journal.pone.0239165,Electric clothes dryers: An underestimated source of microfiber pollution,"Microplastics, particularly microfibers, are ubiquitous, found in aquatic (freshwater and marine) and terrestrial environments and within the food web worldwide. It is well-established that microplastics in the form of textile fibers enter the environment via washing machines and wastewater treatment effluent. Less is known about the release of microfibers from electric clothes dryers. In this study we measure microfiber emissions from home installed dryers at two different sites. At each site the distribution of fibers landing on the snow's surface outside dryer vents and the weight of lint in dryer exhaust exiting dryer vents were measured. Fibers from the pink polyester fleece blankets used in this study were found in plots throughout a 30ft (9.14m) radius from the dryer vents, with an average number across all plots of 404 ?? 192 (SD) (Site 1) and 1,169 ?? 606 (SD) (Site 2). The majority of the fibers collected were located within 5 ft (1.52m) of the vents. Averages of 35 ?? 16(SD)mg (Site 1) and 70 ?? 77 (SD)mg (Site 2) of lint from three consecutive dry cycles were collected from dryer vent exhaust. This study establishes that electric clothes dryers emit masses of microfiber directly into the environment. Microfiber emissions vary based on dryer type, age, vent installation and lint trap characteristics. Therefore, dryers should be included in discussions when considering strategies, policies and innovations to prevent and mitigate microfiber pollution. ?? 2020 Public Library of Science.

X7KWWXS4,10.1016/j.compositesb.2020.108217,Energy absorption and failure pattern of hybrid composite tubes under quasi-static axial compression,"Novel fiber-metal hybrid tubes with overlapped fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) and aluminum layers were proposed in this paper. By combining progressive failure behavior of composites and large plastic deformation of metal materials, the structure was hybridized at mesoscopic scale. To this end, circular fiber/aluminum hybrid tubes with various inner diameters (40, 60, and 80 mm) combined with parent materials (Al-1060, carbon fiber, and glass fiber) were fabricated using vacuum bag molding process. Quasi-static uniaxial compressive tests were conducted to comprehensively explore the effects of geometric factors and failure patterns on energy absorption capability. The experimental results revealed that the pristine FRP and CF/Al (carbon fiber and aluminum) hybrid tubes collapsed in a progressive failure mode and generated abundant intra- and inter-laminar cracks during crushing. The GF/Al (glass fiber and aluminum) hybrid tubes with large diameters collapsed in an unstable and inefficient mode due to local buckling and delamination. Compared with bare aluminum tubes (Al 6061-T6), the specific energy absorption (SEA) and crushing force efficiency (CFE) of CF/Al hybrid structures were improved significantly by respectively 54.3% and 40.4% for tubes with 40 mm inner diameter. Furthermore, the CFE of CF/Al hybrid structures improved by more than 40% when compared to their bare CFRP counterparts, though the SEA reduced by more than 5.5%. In sum, the proposed hybrid design efficiently reduced the peak crushing force with desirable SEA, which has great potential for low-cost and lightweight energy absorber applications. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

AMUHL68A,10.1002/naaq.10153,Effect of Transport Method on Subsequent Survivorship and Gonad Yield/Quality in the Red Sea Urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus,"Sea urchin gonad enhancement entails collecting adults with low gonad yields from the wild, placing them in land-based or sea-based captivity, and feeding them a prepared or natural diet to produce high quality/quantity gonads for marketing. Collection and transportation to the culture facility can be stressful to the urchins and cause subsequent mortalities and suboptimal gonad yield/quality. Minimizing this handling stress is critical to ensuring maximum survivorship and optimal gonad enhancement, yet very little research has examined this, with no information being available for the red sea urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus. The present study examined survivorship, gonad yield, and gonad quality of red sea urchins 2 weeks after exposure to three 2-h transport methods: (1) milk crates placed in two plastic fish totes filled with ambient seawater (?€?wet crate?€?), (2) sealed Styrofoam boxes filled with ambient seawater (?€?wet box?€?), and (3) sealed Styrofoam boxes without seawater, but with wet burlap placed on top of the urchins (?€?dry box?€?). While no gonadal parameters significantly differed between transportation methods, the percentage of survivorship for both the wet boxes and wet crates was 100%, while that for the dry boxes was 58.3% after 2 weeks, indicating that wet transport should be preferred over dry transport for red sea urchins. ?? 2020 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

To better understand the contribution of hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen-bonding interaction, ?€-?€ interaction and electrostatic interaction on the adsorption of hydrophilic compounds on microplastics and their adsorption behavior in natural waters, polyethylene terephthalate (PET, &lt;150 ??m) was used as an adsorbent and 4-chlorophenol (MCP), 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) were used as adsorbates. The results of batch adsorption experiments showed that chlorophenols (CPs) reached adsorption sites of PET through film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion. pH greatly affected the adsorption capacity. Hydrophobic interaction was the main adsorption mechanism of undissociated CPs on PET. Hydrogen-bonding interaction was also an adsorption mechanism between undissociated CPs and PET, and the contribution of hydrogen-bonding interaction to adsorption decreased with the increase of chlorine content. Meanwhile, the increase of chlorine content was favorable to the hydrophobic interaction between undissociated CPs and PET. However, higher chlorine content CPs with lower pKa values tended to dissociate at neutral pH condition and resulted in stronger electrostatic repulsion with PET. The increase of solution ionic strength and fulvic acid content negatively affected the adsorption of DCP and TCP on PET, but did not show significant impacts on MCP adsorption. Similarly, the adsorption capacity obtained using Taihu lake water and Bohai seawater as matrices was much lower than that using laboratory water for both DCP and TCP, while the adsorption coefficient (Kd) of MCP remained at approximately 10.6 L/kg to 11.4 L/kg in the three different solution matrices. The Kd values exhibited using natural water matrices consistently followed the order of DCP &gt; MCP &gt; TCP. This study provides insights into the fate of CPs in the presence of microplastics and suggests that the potential risks posed by CPs and microplastics to aqueous ecosystems merit further investigation. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The experimental programme covered compression tests of a large number of standard concrete cylinders, which were prepared from the following four series of concrete: (1) the reference normal concrete, (2) sea-sand concrete, (3) seawater concrete (SwC), and (4) seawater sea-sand concrete. The concrete cylinders were either unconfined or confined with externally wrapped carbon fibre-reinforced polymer jackets to be tested at various ages from the early to the long term. This article presents the results of the first-phase tests, which covered a total of 48 specimens from the four series of concrete, with a half of them tested in the unconfined condition at the ages of 7 and 28 days, and another half tested with either one-ply or two-ply carbon fibre-reinforced polymer jackets at 28 days. The results show that at the ages of 7 and 28 days, the unconfined concrete specimens prepared with seawater and/or sea sand developed a slightly higher compressive strength, as compared to those prepared from normal concrete. When confined with carbon fibre-reinforced polymer jackets, the compressive stress?€?strain responses of concrete with or without seawater and/or sea sand were very similar. The use of seawater and sea sand did not seem to have significant effects on the compressive strength, ultimate axial strain and stress?€?strain responses of confined concrete, and the ultimate strain capacity of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer jackets neither. The test results were also compared with the predictions of an existing analysis-oriented stress?€?strain model for fibre-reinforced polymer-confined concrete. It is shown that the compressive strength, ultimate axial strain, stress?€?strain responses and dilation behaviour of the carbon fibre-reinforced polymer-confined concrete with or without seawater/sea sand can be reasonably well predicted. ??

WK45SPWG,10.1111/eva.12992,Marine protected areas rescue a sexually selected trait in European lobster,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly implemented worldwide to maintain and restore depleted populations. However, despite our knowledge on the myriad of positive responses to protection, there are few empirical studies on the ability to conserve species?€? mating patterns and secondary sexual traits. In male European lobsters (Homarus gammarus), the size of claws relative to body size correlates positively with male mating success and is presumably under sexual selection. At the same time, an intensive trap fishery exerts selection against large claws in males. MPAs could therefore be expected to resolve these conflicting selective pressures and preserve males with large claws. We explored this hypothesis by contrasting claw size of males and females in three pairs of MPAs and nearby fished areas in southern Norway. By finding that male lobsters have up to 8% larger claws inside MPAs compared to similarly sized males in fished areas, our study provides evidence that MPAs rescue a secondary sexual trait. Recovery from harvest selection acting on claws is the most likely explanation; however, the higher abundance of lobster inside MPAs does not rule out a plastic response on claw size due to increased competition. Regardless of the underlying cause, our study demonstrates (a) the value of protected areas as a management tool for mitigating fisheries-induced evolution and (b) that MPAs help maintaining the scope for sexual selection in populations with vulnerable life histories and complex mating system. ?? 2020 The Authors.

However, dissolved organics material (chemical oxygen demand, COD) and especially ammonia are produced from uneaten feed and metabolic wastes of fish. To purify the MRAS water, this study adopted a sequencing biofilm batch reactor (SBBR) and comparatively investigated the performances of four different carriers on ammonia and COD removal. Results indicated that the NH4+-N removal rates were 0.045 ?? 0.05, 0.065 ?? 0.008, 0.089 ?? 0.005, and 0.093 ?? 0.003 kg/(m3??d), and the COD removal rates were 0.019 ?? 0.010, 0.213 ?? 0.010, 0.255 ?? 0.015, and 0.322 ?? 0.010 kg/(m3??d) in the SBBRs packed with porous plastic, bamboo ring, maifan stone, and ceramsite carriers, respectively. Among the four carriers, ceramsite exhibited the best performance for both NH4+-N (80%) and COD (33%) removal after the SBBR reached the steady-state operation conditions. For all carriers studied, the NH4+-N removal kinetics could be well simulated by the first-order model, and the NH4+-N and COD removal rates were logarithmically correlated with the carrier?€?s specific surface area. Due to its high ammonia removal, stable performance and easy operation, the ceramsite-packed SBBR is feasible for MRAS water treatment. ?? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",
HV4B85HU,10.1029/2019TC005793,Can Grain Size Reduction Initiate Transform Faults??€?Insights From a 3-D Numerical Study,"Oceanic transform faults formed at mid-ocean ridges are intrinsic features of modern plate tectonics. Nevertheless, numerical mantle convection models typically struggle to reproduce the strike-slip movement observed along transform faults on Earth. Instead, mantle convection models tend to produce mostly convergent and divergent plate boundaries. Based on regional visco-(elasto)-plastic thermomechanical models it has been demonstrated that a strong strain-induced weakening of rocks has to be assumed in order to initiate and stabilize the characteristic orthogonal ridge-transform spreading patterns. However, the physical origin of such intense rheological weakening remains unclear. Considering that in nature oceanic transform faults show a strongly reduced grain size, a potentially strong influence of grain size reduction processes on the rheological strength of these structures can be assumed. Employing 3-D thermomechanical visco-plastic models, we study the effect of grain size reduction on oceanic transform fault initiation. Our results show that ductile weakening induced by grain size reduction indeed results in sufficient localization to initiate a transform fault. Without any additional weakening mechanisms, transform faults in our models remain stable up to 2 Myr. We identify parameters that affect stability and longevity of the transform fault during the initiation phase, such as the grain damage formulation and grain growth prefactor. In our models, transform faults initiate in the brittle crust and propagate downward, thus indicating a top-down initiated localization process. The observed grain size, rheology, and strain rate inside the shear zone of our models agree well with observations in nature; however, the longevity of natural examples cannot be reached. ??2020.

NPJSWPFA,10.3390/polym12102330,Vitrimer-like shape memory polymers: Characterization and applications in reshaping and manufacturing,"The shape memory effect (SME) refers to the ability of a material to recover its original shape, but only in the presence of a right stimulus. Most polymers, either thermo-plastic or thermoset, can have the SME, although the actual shape memory performance varies according to the exact material and how the material is processed. Vitrimer, which is between thermoset and thermo-plastic, is featured by the reversible cross-linking. Vitrimer-like shape memory polymers (SMPs) combine the vitrimer-like behavior (associated with dissociative covalent adaptable networks) and SME, and can be utilized to achieve many novel functions that are difficult to be realized by conventional polymers. In the first part of this paper, a commercial polymer is used to demonstrate how to characterize the vitrimer-like behavior based on the heating-responsive SME. In the second part, a series of cases are presented to reveal the potential applications of vitrimer-like SMPs and their composites. It is concluded that the vitrimer-like feature not only enables many new ways in reshaping polymers, but also can bring forward new approaches in manufacturing, such as, rapid 3D printing in solid state on space/air/sea missions. ?? 2020 by the authors.

8C8NQ52Q,10.1016/j.oceano.2020.03.003,Artists in the face of threats of climate change,"In contemporary visual culture, the subject of climate change and the need for commitment to counteract it (Demos, 2016; K??rber et al., 2017; Tsing et al., 2017) are increasingly being addressed. The artists' observation concerns not only the natural effects of climate change but also their impact on the social and cultural heritage of the inhabitants of regions of the most endangered areas. Areas most vulnerable to destruction: oceans, coral reefs and polar regions are becoming a particular subject of interest for artists. A reflection of this interest can be the increasing number of exhibitions devoted to the current state of the environment (i.e. the project Plasticity of the Planet presented in 2019 in Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art in Warsaw). In the article selected artistic strategies to publicize the problems of ecology will be indicated. The first strategy is the exhibition of the beauty of the natural environment and the melancholy associated with its disappearance. An example of this can be Art of the Arctic by environmental photographer Kerry Koeping who focuses the audience's attention on ocean literacy by means of affecting landscapes of the Arctic or the artistic residence in PAN Hornsund Polar Station of Janusz Oleksa. The second way is to indicate the physical and biological effects of climate change. An example would be the work of Kelly Jazvac who, in collaboration with an oceanographer Charles Moore and a geologist Patricia Corcoran, presents plastiglomerate by Agnieszka Kurant ?€? new forms of fossils, resulting from the combination of shells and stones with plastics or artificial compounds. The third method is the presentation of the residents' experience. The examples are works of Subhankar Banerjee, who draws inspiration from ethnographic research and documentary films and Jakub Witek's documentary about Polish emigrants living in Iceland. The artist presents the consequences of climate change for the inhabitants of the polar regions. The fourth way is to build a metaphor for the presence of a ?€?stranger?€? ?€? a traveller, an explorer or a scientist. An example is a photographic performance entitled Polaris Summer by Kuba B??kowski conducted during a scientific expedition to Spitsbergen, or three-screen projection by John Akomfrah's showing the relationship between man and oceans in the context of exploitation of natural and human resources. For the artistic practices described in the article, I use the theoretical framework of environmental art that binds together aesthetics, ethics and politics. The purpose of the article is to check whether such a connection can be attractive to the audience. ?? 2020",
NVV9GCN4,10.1007/s10661-020-08602-w,An open-source geospatial framework for beach litter monitoring,"Here, we present a framework for a beach litter monitoring process, based on free and open-source software (FOSS), which allows customization for any sampling design. The framework was developed by means of a GIS project (QGIS), a GIS collector (QField), and an R code, allowing further adjustments according to the area to be surveyed and research questions. The aim is to improve data collection, accessibility, and interoperability, as well as to help to fill the currently existing gap between fieldwork and data analysis, preventing typos and allowing better data processing. Therefore, it is expected to take less than an hour from ending fieldwork to obtaining up-to-date products. To test the developed open-source geospatial framework, it was applied in different sectors and dates on an important southern Brazilian touristic beach. Results obtained from the open-source geospatial framework application produce baseline information on beach litter issues, such as amounts, sources, and spatial and temporal patterns. Adoption of the framework can facilitate data collection by local and regional stakeholders, and the results obtained from it can be applied to support management strategies. For researchers, it produces spatialized data for each item in an already tidy format, which can be used for robust and complex models. A series of supplementary files support reproducibility and provide a guide to future users. ?? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",
DUQ2XAMW,10.1016/j.tws.2020.106907,Study on the crashworthiness of windowed multi-cell square tubes under axial and oblique impact,"The crumpling of aluminium alloy AA6060 T4 thin-walled tubes when subjected to axial and oblique impact is often experienced in collisions. Tubes with holes (so-called windows) and multi-cell tubes are efficient in terms of the structure's energy absorption. This paper proposes a combination of rectangular windows and multi-cell square tubes to improve the structure's crashworthiness. The advantages of the introduction of windows into the structure can diminish the initial peak collapsing load. This can also improve the crashworthiness performance and the mechanism of a folding formation. However, this introduction causes cracks in the tube and thus reduces the plastic zone area of the fold. The decrease in the plastic zone area and the cracks reduce the tube's energy absorption capacity. The specific energy absorption (SEA) and mean collapsing load (Pmcl) of WMCT-I and WMCT-III under axial impact is higher by about 20% and 16% compared to those of MCT-I and MCT-III, respectively. Relating to MCT-II having a wall-to-corner (WTC) one, the tube with holes does not improve in either case of axial and oblique impact. Extensive theoretical solutions are proposed to predict the mean collapsing loads of the windowed multi-cell tubes. The results of the theoretical predictions are compared to those of the numerical simulation. The Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method is applied to select the better structure for the energy absorber application. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

However, the residual stress induced by repair welding potentially threatens the safety of the repaired weldments, especially stainless steel pipe structures and pressure vessels used in nuclear power plants. Based on the MSC. Marc software, a thermal elastic plastic finite element method with the consideration of full 3-D model, moving heat source and advanced material model was developed to simulate residual stress distribution induced by repair welding. In the current study, the effectiveness of the developed computational approach was verified by a two-pass thin-walled butt-welded SUS304 steel pipe mock-up at first. Then, the residual stress distributions in a medium thickness SUS304 steel pipe butt-welded joint before and after repair welding were investigated numerically. The simulation results show that the peak value of axial residual stress after repair welding was significantly increased, while the variation of the maximum value of hoop residual stress was limited. In addition, the effect of repair length on the feature of residual stress distribution was studied numerically. The numerical results indicate that the peak value of repair-induced residual stress decreases with the repair length. The main reason is that the longer the repair welding length is, the less local constraint will be. The residual stress distribution in the repair area at service temperature was also discussed in this study. The results obtained from the current study will be helpful in evaluating the structural integrity of repaired weldments. ?? 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",

Phthalates are not chemically bound to the items to which they are added and can easily leach into the surrounding environment. Anthropogenic drivers, such as coastal plastic pollution and wastewater runoff, increase the exposure potential for coastal marine fauna. Phthalate exposure in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins has been the focus of recent study, with indications of heightened exposure to certain phthalate compounds. The objective of this study was to compare urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations among bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sampled in Sarasota Bay, FL, to levels reported in human samples collected as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?€?s (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Monoethyl phthalate (MEP) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) were the most prevalent metabolites detected in dolphin urine (n = 51; MEP = 29.41%; MEHP = 54.90%). The geometric mean (GM) concentration of MEP was significantly lower for dolphins (GM = 4.51 ng/mL; 95% CI: 2.77?€?7.34 ng/mL) compared to humans (p<0.05), while dolphin concentrations of MEHP (GM = 4.57 ng/mL; 95% CI: 2.37?€?8.80 ng/mL) were significantly higher than levels reported in NHANES (p<0.05). Health impacts to bottlenose dolphins resulting from elevated exposure to the MEHP parent compound (diethyl-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, DEHP) are currently unknown. However, given the evidence of endocrine disruption, reproductive impairment, and abnormal development in humans, pursuing investigations of potential health effects in exposed bottlenose dolphins would be warranted.

SV6RXFAM,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109228,Multiple working hypotheses for hyperallometric reproduction in fishes under metabolic theory,"Hyperallometric reproduction, whereby large females contribute relatively more to the renewal of the population than small females, is purported to be widespread in wild populations, especially in fish species. Bioenergetic models derived from a sufficiently general metabolic theory should be able to capture such a relationship but it was recently stated that no existing models adequately capture hyperallometric reproduction. If this were true it would seriously challenge our capacity to develop robust predictions of the life history and population dynamics in changing environments for many species. Here, using the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) as a test case, we demonstrate multiple ways that hyperallometric reproduction in a population may emerge from the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, some inherently related to the metabolism and life history and others related to plastic or genetically based intraspecific variation. In addition, we demonstrate an empirical and modelled hypoallometric scaling of reproduction in this species when environment is controlled. This work shows how complex metabolic responses may underlie apparently simple relationships between weight and reproduction in the wild and provides new and testable hypotheses regarding the factors driving reproductive scaling relationships found in the wild. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Due to logistic limitations, this environmental compartment is not routinely sampled, which is evident in the limited number of studies conducted in subtidal zones, compared to intertidal zones and open waters. In order to fill part of the knowledge gap, this study aims to determine the abundance of microplastics in subtidal sediments in a shallow coastal embayment. Sediment samples were collected using the Reineck box corer from the RV Celtic Voyager. Microplastics were extracted by density separation using sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4??2H2O)). Subsequently, a subsample of fibres were confirmed as having a synthetic origin by ??-FTIR spectroscopic analysis. A relatively low abundance of microplastics was recorded, c. 73 MP/kg d.w. of sediment, with a variable range across and within stations e.g. 0.3?€?15.4/100 g d.w. All identified microplastics were secondary (i.e. fibres (99%), fragments (1%)), with the majority identified as polystyrene, polyester, and polyethylene terephthalate. The data in this study illustrates the need for replicates and monitoring marine sediments for microplastics. ?? 2020 The Authors",
MGUUH7P6,10.3389/fmars.2020.560424,Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Analysis Reveals a Conserved Epigenetic Response to Seasonal Environmental Variation in the Staghorn Coral Acropora cervicornis,"Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation have been shown to participate in plastic responses to environmental change in a wide range of organisms, including scleractinian corals. Unfortunately, the current understanding of the links between environmental signals, epigenetic modifications, and the subsequent consequences for acclimatory phenotypic changes remain obscure. Such a knowledge gap extends also to the dynamic nature of epigenetic changes, hampering our ability to ascertain the magnitude and extent of these responses under natural conditions. The present work aims to shed light on these subjects by examining temporal changes in genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis in the island of Culebra, PR. During a 17-month period, a total of 162 polymorphic loci were identified using Methylation-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP). Among them, 83 of these restriction fragments displayed changes in DNA methylation that were significantly correlated to seasonal variation as determined mostly by changes in sea water temperature. Remarkably, the observed time-dependent variation in DNA methylation patterns is consistent across coral genets, coral source sites and site-specific conditions studied. Overall, these results are consistent with a conserved epigenetic response to seasonal environmental variation. These findings highlight the importance of including seasonal variability into experimental designs investigating the role of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation in responses to stress. ??

X49ST7MR,10.1029/2020GL088395,Cohesional Slip on a Plate Subduction Boundary During a Large Earthquake,"The frontal part of the Japan Trench plate boundary fault, which slipped during the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Mw 9.0), is enriched in smectite and is intrinsically weak owing to the high swelling pressure of this mineral. Our rheometric experiments using analog fault materials demonstrate that ?€?cohesional slip,?€? rather than frictional slip, is a realistic faulting process in the studied fault zone. The cohesional slip can be described by the Bingham plastic model. Consequently, the coseismic shear stress is described by the yield stress and plastic viscosity. Comparison of the results with the average shear stress derived from a previous study suggests that the slip zone thickness for cohesional slip is 1.3 cm or less. This finding is consistent with textures characterized by discrete slip planes of comparable thickness observed in the recovered fault rocks, suggesting that these slip planes were activated during the Tohoku-Oki earthquake. ??2020.

The seagrass ecosystem is commonly known to play significant roles in biodiversity support. The occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in sediments, surface water, fish, and benthos collected from the seagrass ecosystem at Kodingareng Lompo island of Makassar City were observed. From 29 sediment samples collected the range of MPs abundance was 2.96-28.3 item.kg-1 dried sediment. Meanwhile, MPs abundance in surface water was 0.023 item.m-3, exceptionally lower compared to the sediment value. Of 4 fish species observed, Siganus canaliculatus was the species with the highest number of ingested MPs. On the other hand, sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla ingested more MPs compared to other benthos species. There was no consistent MPs abundance in sediments found at present studies. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences seen on MPs abundance within all components examined using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis. However, the presence of MPs in all components observed has clearly shown a wide dispersion of MPs contamination in the marine food web, as seagrass is a well-known productive ecosystem with high marine biodiversity assemblage in the tropical region. ??

Direct ingestion and trophic transfer are likely to be the main pathway for microplastics to bioaccumulate in upper trophic level organisms. Bioaccumulation potential of MPs in marine mammalian foodwebs is scarcely known. To understand whether microplastics bioaccumulate in marine mammals, a bioaccumulation model for MPs was developed for the filter-feeding humpback whale and fish-eating resident killer whale foodwebs of the Northeastern Pacific. Applying three concentration scenarios for MPs by entering observed water and sediment concentrations as input data (low, high, and moderate scenarios), and tested under two different elimination rates (kE) for zooplankton, the model predicted species-specific and foodweb-specific bioaccumulation potential. The predator-prey biomagnification factor (BMFTL, used to assess the ratio of the MP concentration in predator to that in prey adjusted to the difference of trophic levels), involving cetaceans, appeared to be not only lower than one or equal to one (BMFTL ??? 1 as in resident killer whale/Chinook salmon), but also BMFTL &gt; 1 in some predator-prey relationships (humpback whale/zooplankton). Depending on the magnitude of abiotic concentrations used in the modeling, the trophic magnification factor (TMF) regression analyses over time showed lack of evidence for trophic magnification as the magnification was independent of the trophic level, indicating no changes (TMF = 1; p &gt; 0.05), and trophic dilution (TMF &lt; 1; p &lt; 0.05) due to the decrease in MP concentrations as the trophic level increased. Projected biomagnification in simplified foodwebs revealed no significant increase in concentrations as the trophic level increased (TMF = 1; p &gt; 0.05), following 100?€?365 days. Compared to the high biomagnification behavior of persistent organic pollutants in marine foodwebs, scarce biomagnification capacity of microplastic was predicted in the cetacean foodwebs. Notwithstanding, the moderate to high microplastic bioaccumulation predicted in some lower trophic level marine organisms highlights the health risks of toxic exposure to marine fauna strongly relying on fish and coastal communities highly dependent on seafood. This modeling work provides a tool to assess the bioaccumulation potential and impact of microplastics in the marine environment to support risk assessment and inform plastic waste management. ??

The samples were collected between May and July 2019. Microplastics were isolated from the surface water and sediment samples by using wet peroxide oxidation (WPO) followed by density separation. Microplastics were sorted visually according to their shapes and colours after being examined under photographed microscope. The most abundant particle found in this study was threadlike and fragment shapes. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to identify functional groups in the composition of microplastics to determine the types of microplastic found in the samples. Polypropylene (PP) was the most abundance type of microplastic found in the surface water and sediments of Kelantan Bay. This study provides an insight of the types of microplastics found in Kelantan Bay and therefore, further actions need to be taken to curb the distribution of microplastics in marine ecosystem from threatening the marine food chain of Kelantan Bay. ??

A year-long monitoring case study from the urban Kiel Fjord, southwest Baltic Sea","Microplastics are ubiquitous to most marine environments worldwide, and their management has become one of the major challenges facing stakeholders. Here we monitored monthly, between March 2018 and March 2019, the abundance of microplastics (0.3?€?18.2 mm) at the sea surface within the Kiel Fjord, southwest Baltic Sea. Microplastics were sampled at eight locations, inside and outside the fjord, near potential source of microplastics, such as the outlets of storm drains or the Kiel-B??lk wastewater treatment plant, the Schwentine River mouth and the entrance of the Kiel Canal. Weather (wind, precipitations) and seawater (salinity, temperature) parameters were compared to the spatiotemporal distribution of the microplastics. We found an overall stable, and low (0.04 particles/m3), microplastic load within the Kiel Fjord compared to other urban areas worldwide with comparable population densities. No relationship was found between the microplastic abundance and the environmental factors, but the few samples that yielded unusually high amount of microplastics were all preceded by rainfall and snow/ice melt. During such events, vast amounts of water, potentially contaminated with microplastics, were released into the fjord via the storm drainage system. The microplastic abundances at the wastewater plant outflow were among the lowest of our survey, likely thanks to an efficient filtering system. The results of this study highlight the importance to repeat microplastic samplings over time and space to determine with confidence baseline microplastic abundance and to detect unusual acute contamination, especially during snow and ice melting. Overall, the microplastic abundance within the Kiel Fjord was low, probably thanks to efficient waste management on land. However, improvements are still needed to filter millimetre-sized particles within the storm drainage system, which is likely a major source of microplastics into the marine environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Their presence in the environment is largely due to in situ generation from physical and chemical weathering of larger plastics, and thus has left environmental community concerned in the post-banned era of microbead use in personal care products through the passage of Microbead-Free Waters Act in the United States. To improve understanding of secondary microplastic formation, accelerated weathering has been conducted on four materials (high-density polyethylene, high impact polystyrene, nylon 6, and polypropylene) under ultraviolet radiation (equivalent to 44 days in full sun) in simulated seawater. Physical and chemical characterization of the plastics were completed following ultraviolet exposure. This simulated weathering generated microfibers from high-density polyethylene and nylon 6, while high impact polystyrene and polypropylene did not physically degrade. The techniques used were applied to sediment samples containing plastic pellets collected from Cox Creek in Port Comfort, TX (near a large plastics manufacturer), which were purified for analysis and were found to contain microplastics composed of polypropylene and polyethylene. These findings can be used to determine degradation pathways and plastic source tracking, which can facilitate risk assessment and environmental management. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
SG42CI4L,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139694,Plastic additives as tracers of microplastic sources in Japanese road dusts,"Plastic waste and microplastic pollution has been reported around the world. Up to 80% of marine plastic debris is derived from land, thus it is important to identify the terrestrial sources of microplastics to reduce their environmental impact. In this study, the abundance and polymer type of microplastics were characterized for road dusts collected from Kumamoto, Okinawa, and Tokyo, Japan. In addition, the profiles of additives in plastic products on the road and in road dust microplastics were determined to evaluate the potential use of additives as chemical tracers of microplastic sources. The abundance of microplastics in road dusts was 96 ?? 85 pieces/kg (dry wt.) (n = 16), 68 ?? 77 pieces/kg (n = 12), and 230 ?? 50 pieces/kg (n = 8) in Kumamoto, Okinawa and Tokyo, respectively. In Kumamoto and Okinawa, significant correlations were observed between total microplastic abundance in road dusts and daily vehicle traffic. In Tokyo, high population and traffic density may account for the greater abundance of microplastics in road dusts than in the other cities. Polymer analysis shows that poly (diallyl phthalate), polyvinyl chloride, polymethyl methacrylate and polyester accounted for 60% to 70% of the total microplastics analyzed. To determine the potential sources of microplastics, plastic additives were analyzed in road dusts and fragments of road marking from the study area. Five common additives including plasticizers and flame retardants were identified in both road dusts and road markings. This suggests that road markings are a significant source of microplastics in Japanese road dust, and that additive profiles in plastic samples may be suitable tracers for determining the sources of microplastics in road dust. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

However, the release performance of ivermectin from the hydrolyzed acrylic-based resin into the seawater is not clear. Moreover, the efficiency and mechanism of ivermectin in preventing biofilm or slime formation have not been fully investigated. In this study, a coating was developed by mixing ivermectin with an acrylic-based resin, silyl acrylate copolymer, and a 45-day in situ antifouling test was conducted in the Yellow Sea. Direct observation and confocal microscope investigation indicated that the polymer coating with ivermectin was effective against biofilm formation. High-throughput sequencing analysis showed that ivermectin can selectively inhibit the adhesion of microorganisms. Abundances of Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria decreased significantly with the increased concentration of ivermectin. As for the eukaryote community, species of Stolidobranchia and unidentified_Bacillariophyceae were proved to be sensitive to ivermectin. Therefore, the ivermectin/silyl acrylate copolymer coating is a promising substitute for marine antifouling material. ?? 2020",

This paper proposes a new framework based on the combined use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and a mobile application to map and quantify marine macro-litter (&gt;2.5 cm) accumulation on coastal dunes. The first application on a dune area of 200 m ?? 80 m at the north-east Atlantic Portuguese coast is shown. Nine different marine litter categories were found, with styrofoam fragments (23% of the total amount) and plastic bottles (20%) being the most abundant items. Plastic was the most common material (76%). The highest number of items (272) was found on the backdune, mostly related with fishing activities (octopus pots and Styrofoam fragments). In contrast, the highest density (0.031 items/m2) was found on the foredune, with the most abundant items associated with human recreational activities (for example, plastic bottles, bags, papers and napkins). Three major marine litter hotspots ( 0.1 items/m2) were identified in correspondence of dune blowouts. The recognition of the primary marine litter pathways highlighted the main role that wind and overwash events play on dune contamination, and suggests that the dune ridge restoration can act as a mitigation measure for preventing marine litter accumulation on the backdune. This study shows how UAS offer the possibility of a detailed non-intrusive survey, and gives a new impulse to coastal dune litter monitoring, where the long residence time of marine debris may threaten the bio-ecological equilibrium of these ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Coastal marine environments are being increasingly subjected to reduced water quality from urbanization and leading to contamination of important fishery species. Given the importance of seafood exchanged as a global protein source, it is imperative to maintain seafood safety worldwide. To illustrate the potential health risks associated with urbanization in a coastal environment, we use next-generation high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene combined with infrared spectroscopy to characterize and quantify a vast range of potential human bacterial pathogens and microdebris contaminants in seawater, sediment and an important oyster fishery along the Mergui Archipelago in Myanmar. Through the quantification of >1.25 million high-quality bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) reads, we detected 5459 potential human bacterial pathogens belonging to 87 species that are commonly associated with gut microbiota and an indication of terrestrial runoff of human and agricultural waste. Oyster tissues contained 51% of all sequenced bacterial pathogens that are considered to be both detrimental and of emerging concern to human health. Using infrared spectroscopy, we examined a total of 1225 individual microdebris particles, from which we detected 78 different types of contaminant materials. The predominant microdebris contaminants recovered from oyster tissues included polymers (48%), followed by non-native minerals (20%), oils (14%) and milk supplement powders (14%). Emerging technologies provide novel insights into the impacts of coastal development on food security and risks to human and environmental health. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

The reinforcement bars employed were steel bars, basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP), and glass FRP (GFRP) bars. The beam performance in the service stage, such as crack development, was mainly analyzed. Based on the current codes and gathered data, the equation for predicting the maximum crack width of FRP-RC beams under short-term loading was proposed. The results showed that the crack width and deflection of the FRP-beams were larger compared with those of steel-beams. An increase in reinforcement ratio or section depth notably improved the beam stiffness, thereby reducing the deflection and crack width. The application of small diameter reinforcements was beneficial to decrease the crack width without compromising the beam deflection. Based on the test results, the average bond coefficient was 1.13, which was in good agreement with the value of 1.0 provided by CSAS806-12 for ribbed reinforcements. The proposed formula of crack width calculation can be applied as a guideline for the estimation of crack development during the service of SWSSC beams. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Combined with ICCP technique, a new system has been proposed in this paper with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) as dual-functional material: auxiliary anode and partial reinforcement simultaneously. The electrochemical and mechanical performances of CFRP in the new ICCP system were investigated experimentally with two kinds of reinforcement bar: CFRP bar and steel-fiber composite bar (SFCB). First, the accelerated anodic polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement were carried out for CFRP bar and SFCB to verify the electrochemical performances. Then, the mechanical performance and underlying degradation mechanism were identified for CFRP bar and SFCB based on the uniaxial tensile test and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, the service life of CFRP bar and SFCB has been evaluated to confirm the fesibility of the proposed system in practical engineering. Results showed that CFRP bar and SFCB possess excellent electrical conductivity and low electrical resistance as the anode in ICCP system. Compared with SFCB, CFRP bar is more promising as an anode material with a stronger polarization resistance capability, an acceptable degradation of the mechanical property and a longer service life. With a current density of 20 mA/m2, the service life was evaluated as 62 years for CFRP bar while 7 years for SFCB. To improve the application of SFCB in ICCP system effectively, some modifications are necessary, such as replacing the inner steel bar with stainless steel bar or adding a protective layer between the steel bar and fiber layer. Furthermore, the proposed system shows great potential for marine RC structures and the comprehensive study of this system will be carried out in future work. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
S857FREU,10.3389/fmars.2020.571929,Assessing the Toxicity of Leachates From Weathered Plastics on Photosynthetic Marine Bacteria Prochlorococcus,"Marine plastic pollution is a well-recognized, global problem. Research addressing plastic pollution has largely focused on investigating impacts on macroorganisms, with few studies investigating effects on marine microbes. We previously showed that marine Prochlorococcus, which are important contributors to oceanic primary production, suffer declines in growth and photosynthetic activity following exposure to leachates from new plastic bags (HDPE) and plastic matting (PVC). However, as such plastics reside in the environment they will be subject to weathering processes, so it is also important to consider how these may alter the composition and amounts of substances available to leach. Here we report on how plastic leachate toxicity is affected by environmental weathering (17- and 112-days in estuarine water) of these common plastic materials. We found that while toxicity was reduced by weathering, materials weathered for up to 112-days continued to leach substances that negatively affected Prochlorococcus growth, photophysiology and membrane integrity. Weathered plastics were found to continue to leach zinc, even after up to 112-days in the environment. The two Prochlorococcus strains tested, NATL2A and MIT9312, showed differences in the sensitivity and timing of their responses, indicating that exposure to leachate from weathered plastics may affect even closely related strains to different degrees. As many marine regions inhabited by Prochlorococcus are likely to be subject to continued accumulation of plastic pollution, our findings highlight the potential for ongoing impacts on these important primary producers. ??

Thus, the environmental management is needed to evaluate and create the future plan to overcome this problem, one of them is the Eco-village. A successful Eco-village is in Kamikatsu (Japan), where the society is well-educated about the environment and sorting their own waste properly. In this study, Japan's zero waste village in Kamikatsu will be a role-model for the Eco-village Conceptual Framework. The method in this study are literature review and field survey. Ciburuy village definitely has the potential to achieve sustainable and environmental-friendly society, starting from proper solid waste management. However, the lake is becoming shallower due to the 20 residential settlement waste that has polluted the lake, and the open dumping and burning activities are commonly seen in some region.

FZXJ8P4D,10.1021/acs.est.0c02288,Rapid Production of Micro- And Nanoplastics by Fragmentation of Expanded Polystyrene Exposed to Sunlight,"Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a common plastic marine debris found in oceans worldwide. The unique ""foamed""structure of EPS, which is composed of thin layers, is more vulnerable to fragmentation than bulk plastics. However, the production rate of micro- and nanoplastics by the fragmentation of EPS following sunlight exposure remains largely unknown. Here, we determined the fragmentation rate and weight loss of EPS in an outdoor weathering experiment that ran for 24 months. It took only 1 month for the weight of an EPS box to decline by 5% due to photodegradation, and approximately 6.7 ?? 107 micro- and nanoparticles/cm2 could be produced at a latitude of 34 ??N. These results indicate that macro EPS debris can continually produce a massive number of particles within a relatively short exposure duration.

In this study, we examine the structural changes in the lamellar arrangements of semicrystalline polyethylene (PE) packaging waste with the aim of understanding the physical mechanisms of embrittlement in PE exposed to the marine environment. PE microplastics and macroplastics from identifiable PE packaging were collected in the Atlantic Ocean and compared to new PE boxes. Several experimental techniques interrogate the effects of environmental exposure on their bulk and surface properties. Size exclusion chromatography determines the molecular weight distribution of the PE polymer chains and differential scanning calorimetry gives the crystallinity. Small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering examines the packing of PE chains into semicrystalline lamellae. Longitudinal acoustic mode Raman spectroscopy provides a complementary measurement of the length of PE polymer chains extending through the crystalline lamellar domains. While there is a high degree of uncertainty in the time scale for the changes, the overall picture at the molecular scale is that although PE becomes more crystalline with environmental exposure, the lamellar order present in new packing boxes is disrupted by the weathering process. This process has important implications for embrittlement and subsequent degradation. Copyright ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

Additionally MPs can sorb hydrophobic contaminants from the water, potentially providing an additional pathway of exposure of aquatic species to contaminants. An acute 48 h laboratory study was conducted to investigate the effects of microplastics and triclosan, both individually and combined, on New Zealand's green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus. Biomarkers included clearance rate, oxygen uptake, byssus production; and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and lipid peroxidation in the gill tissue. Microplastics and triclosan, both individually and combined significantly decreased oxygen uptake and byssus production. These physiological responses were not observed when the microplastics were spiked with triclosan. Triclosan, both alone and spiked to microplastics, increased mussel oxidative stress markers including SOD activity and lipid peroxidation. An enhanced effect was observed on the SOD enzyme activity when mussels were exposed to microplastics spiked with triclosan. No effects on the biochemical biomarkers were observed for mussels exposed to microplastic only. Microplastics enhanced the uptake of triclosan in mussel tissue compared with triclosan only treatments indicating that microplastics potentially provide an additional pathway of exposure to hydrophobic contaminants. ?? 2020",
J3Y39A5X,10.4271/2020-01-2221,Bolted Joints - Still a Key Part of Efficient Powertrains and a Challenge for Simulation,"The bolt is one of the most standardized and most commonly used machine elements. On the other hand, since the mechanics of highly stressed bolted joints and the thread fatigue are complex issues, the design and evaluation of such joints is frequently carried out with major simplifications and assumptions, leading to either over-engineered solutions or to premature failures of the prototypes. The simulation techniques and the computing power that are now available theoretically allow a precise evaluation of the fatigue safety in the most heavily loaded areas through the application of very fine FE models of the thread regions. However, due to the modeling and calculation effort, this is still only acceptable in practice for structures with a limited number of bolts. Furthermore, uncertainties related to material specification including the behavior in the plastic range as well as difficulties in considering thread manufacturing tolerances or residual torsional stresses from the assembly state, makes this approach difficult to apply widely in the engineering practice. An interesting alternative method is a combination of the FE analysis of highly stressed bolted joints with historically well-proven analytical considerations, as proposed in the initially released second part of the VDI 2230 standard. In this way, most of the aspects that are difficult to be effectively simulated by FEA are considered in the VDI 2230 limits defined by hardware tests, while in parallel the unique behavior of the joint including the tension, bending and shearing of the bolt can be precisely simulated. The effective application of the above approach is shown in this paper using the example of a straight-split, inclined-split and a marine type connecting rod. The differences in joint behavior and thus the design requirements as well as the limitations and benefits of the applied evaluation technique are discussed in detail. ?? 2020 SAE International.

The carbon fibre reinforced epoxy matrix composite laminates were interleaved by Polyetherketone-cardo (PEK-C) films and the effect of curing time on the phase morphology spectrum and fracture toughness was investigated in the study. The microstructure-property correlation was explored. The results showed that the PEK-C film interlayer was efficient in the interlaminar toughening and the fracture toughness (GIC) was enhanced by 90.65% at curing time of 1 h. Nevertheless, increasing curing time weakened toughening effect of PEK-C films and GIC was only increased by 9.37% under the curing time of 3 h. The characteristic morphology spectrum in the interlaminar region, consisting of homogeneous PEK-C resin, nodular dualphase and sea-island dualphase, contributed to the improvement of toughness. The homogeneous PEK-C layer was decreased with the curing time increasing due to the more fully permeation of epoxy, resulting in the crack path change from the center of interlaminar region and the interface between interlaminar region and composite layer to merely the interface, which might be the main reason for the weakening of measured crack propagation resistance. ?? 2020",

The gametes are planktonic and face a wide range of stressors, including plastic litter. Nanoplastics are of increasing concern because their size allows pronounced interactions with biological membranes, making them a potential hazard to marine life. In the present study, oyster spermatozoa were exposed for 1h to various doses (from 0.1 to 25??g mL???1) of 50-nm polystyrene beads with amine (50-NH2 beads) or carboxyl (50-COOH beads) functions. Microscopy revealed adhesion of particles to the spermatozoa membranes, but no translocation of either particle type into cells. Nevertheless, the 50-NH2 beads at 10??g mL???1 induced a high spermiotoxicity, characterized by a decrease in the percentage of motile spermatozoa (???79%) and in the velocity (???62%) compared to control spermatozoa, with an overall drop in embryogenesis success (???59%). This major reproduction failure could be linked to a homeostasis disruption in exposed spermatozoa. The 50-COOH beads hampered spermatozoa motility only when administered at 25??g mL???1 and caused a decrease in the percentage of motile spermatozoa (???66%) and in the velocity (???38%), but did not affect embryogenesis success. Microscopy analyses indicated these effects were probably due to physical blockages by microscale aggregates formed by the 50-COOH beads in seawater. This toxicological study emphasizes that oyster spermatozoa are a useful and sensitive model for (i) deciphering the fine interactions underpinning nanoplastic toxicity and (ii) evaluating adverse effects of plastic nanoparticles on marine biota while waiting for their concentration to be known in the environment. ?? 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

In order to improve forming accuracy and reduce residual stress, multi-point repeated forming technology has emerged with the development of processing technology.

However, the simultaneous influences of exposure time and depth on biofilm formation, and subsequently on the properties variations of microplastics is less studied. In this study, polyethylene (PE) film was exposed at three depths (2 m, 6 m, and 12 m) for three time periods (30 days, 75 days, and 135 days) in the coastal seawater of Yellow Sea, China. The results show that the total amount of biofilms markedly increased with exposure time, but decreased with water depth. Typical morphologies and compositions of biofilms such as coccus-, rod-, disc-shaped bacteria and filaments, as well as a dense layer of extracellular polymeric substances were observed on the surfaces of the PE microplastics. Biofilm formation could decrease the hydrophobicity of PE microplastics, and increase the abundances of hydrophilic C???O and C[dbnd]O groups on the surface of PE. Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia were identified as the core microbiome of the PE associated biofilms, while the dominant bacteria families vary from the early to the late phases of the biofilm formation. Our results indicate that microplastics associated biofilms could affect the environmental processes and fates of microplastics in the marine and coastal environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Marine environment exposure may significantly affect the bonding behavior of FRP externally bonded to concrete. This paper is intended for studying the effect of tidal-like condition such as salt solution wet-dry cycling on the behavior of FRP-concrete interface. Exposure tests and analytical approach are carried out on specimens externally bonded with carbon fiber reinforce polymer (CFRP) and basalt fiber-reinforce polymer (BFRP). Test variable include the types of fiber and the environmental exposure periods (0, 90, 180, 270, 360 cycles). From the bending test results, the bilinear bond stress-slip relationships for different exposure periods are derived. Based on these bond stress-slip relationships, the full-range behavior of shear stress along the bond length and debonding load can be obtained through the analytical solution. The test and numerical results show that salt solution wet-dry cycling can greatly affect the bond behavior of CFRP-concrete and BFRP-concrete interface with the increase of exposure periods. With the increase of exposure periods, the position of maximum shear stress tend to move backward, which indicates the behavior of FRP-concrete interface is weakened due to the salt solution wet-dry cycling. Compared with CFRP-concrete interface, salt solution wet-dry cycling exposure has greater influence on the bond behavior of the BFRP-concrete interface. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Based on the current field investigations and source identification studies, the transport pattern from territorial to marine environments is comparatively unknown. Acetochlor concentrations and the microplastic abundance in the water, sediment and fish of Jiaozhou Bay in spring, summer and winter were measured. The seasonal relevance of the typical diffuse agricultural pollutant acetochlor with microplastics in river water and seawater in three zones (estuary, coastal and bay) were analyzed, which demonstrated the similar transport path and source from land to the bay. The electron microscopy and energy spectra of microplastics in three seasons highlight varied characteristics of microplastics during the transport. The spatial distribution of microplastic abundance in the sediment in the bay presented a decreasing pattern from the estuary to the coastal and bay waters. Microplastics were detected in all of the stomach samples in the bay with an abundance of 7.45-10.11 n/g. dw, which show the biological transport from bay.

In this study, the immunotoxicities of polystyrene MPs (diameters 500 nm and 30 ??m) and sertraline (Ser), alone and in combination, were investigated in a bivalve mollusk Tegillarca granosa. Results showed that both MPs and Ser significantly suppressed the immune responses of T. granosa. In addition, though the toxic effect of Ser was not affected by microscale MPs, an evident synergistic immuno-toxic effect was observed between Ser and nanoscale MPs, which indicates a size-dependent interaction between the two. To further ascertain the underlying toxication mechanisms, the intracellular content of reactive oxygen species, apoptosis status, ATP content, pyruvate kinase activity, plasma cortisol level, and in vivo concentrations of neurotransmitters and cytochrome P450 1A1 were analysed. A transcriptomic analysis was also performed to reveal global molecular alterations following Ser and/or MPs exposure. The obtained results indicated that the presence of nanoscale MPs may enhance the immunotoxicity of Ser by (i) inducing apoptosis of haemocytes and, hence, reducing the THC; (ii) constraining the energy availability for phagocytosis; and (iii) hampering the detoxification of Ser. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
FI75I4UK,10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106861,Impacts of land reclamation on sediment transport and sedimentary environment in a macro-tidal estuary,"During the past decades, extensive coastal areas have been reclaimed along the coastline of China, while the physical mechanisms of human pressures on estuarine-sedimentation are largely unknown. This study investigates the impacts of a land reclamation activity on estuarine sedimentation in the Yalu River Estuary (YE), China. For this purpose, we perform a multidisciplinary approach that combines rare earth element (REE) sediment records and numerical simulations. REE pattern of two sediment core samples from the main estuarine branch changed from diverse to homogenous after the early 1970s, which indicates that the estuarine sedimentary environment experienced dramatic change after the land reclamation activity completed in 1975. In order to explore physical drivers behind this change, hydro-sedimentary dynamics were simulated using Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) and an improved Track Marine Plastic Debris (TrackMPD) models. After the land reclamation, model results show that: (1) the degree of flood dominance decreased, and the tidal-choking effect was enhanced in the main branch. (2) The estuary became more well-mixed due to the stronger tidal current; (3) Suspended-sediment concentration (SSC), especially SSC in the bottom layer was increased. (4) The landward sediment flux caused by tidal pumping decreased significantly and the YE may turn into a sediment source instead of a sink if more land is reclaimed in the future. Furthermore, sediments in the main branch were likely from different sources before reclamation but became a homogenous mixture afterwards.

The madreporite pore size ranged from 0.59 to 2.90 ??m (1.22 ?? 0.03 ??m). Microfibres found in the coelomic fluid were transferred from the respiratory trees because the size of microfibre used for this experiment was assumed larger for it to have passed through the gut into the coelom. Although the madreporite pore size is smaller than microfibre used in this study, madreporite can act as another channel to transport nanoplastics from the coelom into the animal tissue. This study showed that sea cucumber uptake microplastics from the environment using the feeding tentacles and the respiratory trees. Chemicals desorption from microplastics into H. cinerascens when ingested may pose a risk to the animals and their consumers. Further study is required to determine if microfibres transfer from the respiratory trees to the coelomic fluid is dependent on microfibre concentration and water temperature. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

A first application in the Dutch cities of Leiden and Wageningen showed similar mean plastic densities (111?€?133 items/km canal) and composition (75?€?80% soft plastics), but different spatial distributions. These observations emphasize the importance of long-term data collection to further understand and quantify spatiotemporal variations of plastics in urban water systems. In turn, this will support improved estimates of the contribution of urban areas to the plastic pollution of rivers and oceans. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",
GGATTYJJ,10.1016/j.watres.2020.116021,The role of wet wipes and sanitary towels as a source of white microplastic fibres in the marine environment,"Understanding source elements of the ocean plastic crisis is key to effective pollution reduction management and policy. The ubiquity of microplastic (MP) fibres in the oceans is considered to derive primarily from clothing fibres released in grey water. Microplastic fibres degraded from widely flushed personal care textile products (wet wipes and sanitary towels) have not been clearly identified in aquatic systems to date. Unregulated personal hygiene and sanitary product labelling fails to identify textile materials. This study demonstrated that white MP fibres in sediments adjacent to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) are comparable with white fibres from sewage-related waste and commercially available consumer sanitary products. Commercially available non-flushable wipes are manufactured from either polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), or a combination of PET and cellulose. Fifty percent of brands labelled flushable that were tested were comprised of a mixture of PET and cellulose and the remainder of cellulose alone. Sanitary towels are made from PP, PE, or a combination of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and PP. The accumulation of large quantities of washed-up sewage-related macro-debris (including wet wipes and sanitary towels) intermingled with seaweed biomass adjacent to the WWTP was associated with a combined sewer overflow. Microplastic fibres extracted from this waste were similar to those extracted from intertidal sediments in close proximity to the WWTP over a ten-month period. In comparison, fibres extracted from locations spatially removed from the WWTP were primarily comprised of ABS, PP and polystyrene. The results confirm that wet wipes and sanitary towels flushed down toilets are an underestimated source of white MP fibres in the environment. Given the global distribution and projected growth of the non-woven textile industry, there is a need for increased public awareness of MP pollution in the marine environment from the inappropriate disposal of sanitary products down the toilet, instead of diversion to alternative land-based waste management. ?? 2020 The Authors",

A total of 884 fish were caught at 20 coastal sites in Spain, France, Italy and Greece and analyzed using a common methodological protocol. Microplastics were found in 46.8% of the sampled fish, with an average number of items per individual of 1.17 ?? 0.07. Filaments were the predominant shape type, while polyethylene and polypropylene were indicated by FTIR as the most common polymer types of ingested microplastics. The frequency of occurrence, as well as the abundance and proportion of types (size, shape, color and polymer) of ingested microplastics, varied among geographical areas. The spatial heterogeneity of the abundance of ingested microplastics was mainly related to the degree of coastal anthropogenic pressure at the sampling sites. Our findings further support the suitability of B. boops as bioindicator of microplastic pollution in the Mediterranean Sea. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

This study had three objectives: 1) determine if seagrass beds and adjacent sand flats in the Florida Keys differed in microplastics concentration, 2) determine if sea cucumbers from the Florida Keys and sand dollars from the panhandle of Florida contain microplastics, and 3) conduct a laboratory experiment on the sand dollar Mellita tenuis to determine if it will ingest plastic microbeads contained in sediment. Both seagrass beds and sand flats in the Florida Keys contained microplastics. Sediment near Pensacola Beach and in St. Joseph Bay contained microplastics. Sea cucumbers from the Florida Keys and sand dollars from the panhandle of Florida contained microplastics in their gut contents. In the laboratory, M. tenuis ingested microbeads in slightly lower proportions compared to surrounding sediment. Both sea cucumbers and sand dollars may make useful animals for monitoring sandy environments for microplastics pollution. ?? 2020",

Despite rivers being the principal source of plastic debris, few of the studies on plastic pollution are focused on freshwater environments. To contribute to filling this knowledge gap, we analyzed three years of data on plastic pollution in the Thames in London. Using a community ecology approach, we analyzed abundance and composition of plastic items, testing for changes across time and space. We found two different types of sites with different compositions of items and a stable abundance of macro-plastic debris in the years 2016?€?2018. We identified a list of statistically significant plastic items as potential representative indicators in future surveys to estimate what is present in the water column as well as conduct effective cleaning and protection efforts. This study aims to optimize future data collection efforts, creating a reference for forthcoming similar work around the globe especially in high-income, high-density urban areas, with implications for policymakers, non-governmental organizations and researchers. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
ARGT2JWA,10.5004/dwt.2020.26026,Microplastics upstream and downstream dam-reservoirs,"The occurrence of microplastics in the aquatic ecosystems, especially in the oceans, is a matter of public record. It is estimated that about 80% of microplastic particles found in oceans and seas are discharged via rivers. But on many rivers especially in Poland, there are dam-reservoirs. The authors wanted to research the role of dam-reservoirs in microplastic removal from the watercourse in this study. The research was done on three rivers were dam-reservoirs are localized. Samples of suspended matter (containing microplastic particles) were taken upstream of the reservoir and as near as possible under the dam. Results showed that the majority of plastic particles are accumulated in the area of the lake, but the presence of microplastics in samples taken under the dam points to the processes that microplastics are transported to the lower parts of the water column. ?? 2020 Desalination Publications.",

To assess the potential risk of nanoplastic pollution, this study exposed marine green microalgae Platymonas helgolandica to 20, 200, and 2000 ??g/L 70-nm polystyrene nanoplastics for 6 days. Nanoplastics significantly inhibited the growth of P. helgolandica during the first 4 days of exposure, and elevated heterocyst frequency was observed in 200 and 2000 ??g/L exposure groups in the early exposure stage. Exposure to 200 and 2000 ??g/L nanoplastics for 4 days increased the membrane permeability and mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased light energy used in photochemical processes of microalgae. Moreover, clear morphological changes, including surface folds, fragmentation, aggregation cluster, and rupture, in the microalgae exposed to nanoplastics were observed under scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope.

To evaluate the current state of microplastics pollution, 28 sediment samples were examined for microplastics and plastic debris contamination along Silver Beach, Southern India. Visual identification followed by FT-IR spectroscopy was used to estimate the overall distribution and characterization of plastic debris. The results reveal that white-colored (44%) and irregularly-shaped (82%) plastics are prevalent in the study area. Moreover, the dominant polymer in the study area is polyvinyl chloride (79%) followed by polyethylene (14%) and nylon (7%). Based on size fractions, mesoplastics are widely distributed in the beach sediments (65%), followed by microplastics (18%) and macroplastics (17%). The regional sources of plastic debris are tourism and fishing activities followed by storm water runoff through the Gadilam river and wave-induced deposition through high tides.

QMND3PR4,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111354,The influence of plastic pollution and ocean change on detrital decomposition,"Plastic pollution and ocean change have mostly been assessed separately, missing potential interactions that either enhance or reduce future impacts on ecosystem processes. Here, we used manipulative experiments with outdoor mesocosms to test hypotheses about the interactive effects of plastic pollution, ocean warming and acidification on macrophyte detrital decomposition. These experiments focused on detritus from kelp, Ecklonia radiata, and eelgrass, Zostera muelleri, and included crossed treatments of (i) no, low and high plastic pollution, (ii) current/future ocean temperatures, and (iii) ambient/future ocean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). High levels of plastic pollution significantly reduced the decomposition rate of kelp and eelgrass by approximately 27% and 36% in comparison to controls respectively. Plastic pollution also significantly slowed the nitrogen liberation from seagrass and kelp detritus. Higher seawater temperatures significantly increased the decomposition rate of kelp and eelgrass by 12% and 5% over current conditions, respectively. Higher seawater temperatures were also found to reduce the nitrogen liberation in eelgrass. In contrast, ocean acidification did not significantly influence the rate of macrophyte decomposition or nutrient liberation. Overall, our results show how detrital processes might respond to increasing plastic pollution and ocean temperatures, which has implications for detrital-driven secondary productivity, nutrient dynamics and carbon cycling. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

However, due to limitations and variations in sampling, analytical measurement methods, and the different units used for reporting data, reliable comparisons between studies in the Gulf region and internationally are not straightforward. This study proposes standardized protocols for marine sediment, seawater, marine biota and aerosol (1) sampling, (2) sample processing, (3) sample identification and (4) reporting units to be used. An attempt has been made to highlight the limitations of the widely employed strategies for sampling microplastics in seawater, where a large portion of the microplastics is not sampled due to the mesh sizes used. The issues with the processing of biota samples and aerosols are likewise addressed, and recommendations are also made for standardization of units for reporting microplastic quantification. Protocols for collection of bottom sediments and aerosols are also proposed. These are the environmental matrixes for which there are no harmonized protocols in the Gulf region; hence if a standardized approach is adopted, it will enable and improve comparisons between the studies within this region and can be useful for similar studies in other marine areas as well. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
VSV98DBW,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139400,Are bacterial communities associated with microplastics influenced by marine habitats?,"This study investigates the influence of marine habitats (i.e., the intertidal zone, supralittoral zone, and seawater), and polymer types (i.e., polyethylene, PE; polyethylene terephthalate, PET) on the diversity and structure of bacterial communities in marine microplastics. A three-month exposure experiment was conducted in Zhairuoshan Island, Zhoushan, China, a typical caldera volcanic island with minor anthropogenic disturbances. At the end of the exposure period, the transition for peaks corresponding to oxidized groups was observed using micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Damages, including pits and cracks, and microorganisms were observed on the surfaces of the PE and PET pellets using scanning electron microscopy. Next-generation amplicon sequencing of the bacterial communities that had colonized the microplastics revealed that bacterial composition significantly varied depending on marine habitats and exposure times, rather than polymer type. Plastic debris in the intertidal zone exhibited the highest bacterial richness and diversity, and Bacillus was considered a potential degrader of plastic debris. The findings demonstrate that bacterial communities that colonize on microplastics are more potentially shaped by marine habitat and exposure time, and this would deepen our understanding of the ecological niche of microplastics surface.

The toxic impact of the nanoplastics on marine microalgae is yet to be explored in detail, and the role of reactive oxygen species generation remains largely unclear. The algal exudates constitute a significant part of the natural organics present in the marine system that may readily adsorb over the nanoplastics to form eco-corona. In the current work a marine alga, Chlorella sp., was considered a bioindicator organism and the effects of eco-corona formation in lessening the toxic impact of the nanoplastics was analyzed. Three differently functionalized polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs): Aminated (NH2-PS NPs), Carboxylated (COOH-PS NPs) and Plain nanoplastics were aged (12, 24, and 48 h) in the EPS containing medium to facilitate eco-corona formation. Decline in cell viability, membrane integrity, and photosynthetic yield were considered to be principle toxicity indicators. The role of oxidative stress as key mode of action (MOA) was studied considering generation of overall reactive oxygen species, and specific radicals (hydroxyl and superoxide) as relevant markers. The changes in antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, and catalase) were also measured. The results clearly indicate a significant decline in the oxidative stress and corresponding lessening of the toxic effects due to eco-corona formation on the PS NPs. The response varied with surface charge on the NPs and ageing duration. Considering the increasing importance of the nanoplastics as one of the major emerging pollutants in marine ecosystem, this study strongly suggests that the EPS mediated eco-corona formation may substantially lessen their toxic burden. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",

Moreover, microplastics have synergistic toxicity to the body after absorbing organic pollutants. In this study, laser scanning confocal microscope and flow cytometry were used to observe the intake of colonic cancer Caco-2 cells to polystyrene plastic with five different particlesizes (300 nm, 500 nm, 1 ??m, 3 ??m, 6 ??m). The uptake rates of microplastics with different particle sizes were 73%, 71%, 49%, 43%, and 30%, respectively. Then, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyze the adsorption differences of polystyrene plastic with different particle sizes to bisphenol A (BPA). Finally, the proliferation toxicity of polystyrene microplastics with different particle sizeson Caco-2 cells before and after adsorption of BPA was compared. MTT experiments confirmed that microplastics caused an increase in cytotoxicity. This result may be related to increased cellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial depolarization. This hypothesis has been confirmed in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assays because nanoscale microplastics cause a large amount of ROS on Caco-2 cells after microplastic exposure, and micron-scale microplastics cause a significant decrease in MMP. At the same time, nanoscale microplastics can cause further depolarization of mitochondria due to their large specific surface area adsorption of BPA, which leads to enhanced cytotoxicity of microplastics after BPA adsorption. The results of this study are of great significance in the evaluation of the safety of microplastics in the human body. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The obtained photoluminescence lifetimes can be used to distinguish between plastic and natural materials. Furthermore, they allow us to identify distinct types of plastics.

This investigation compares four spectroscopic techniques: attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectroscopy, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, coupled to seven classification methods, including machine learning classifiers, to determine accuracy for identifying type of both consumer plastics and marine plastic debris (MPD). With machine learning classifiers, consumer plastic types were identified with 99, 91, 97, and 70% success rates for ATR-FTIR, NIR reflectance spectroscopy, LIBS, and XRF, respectively. The classification of MPD had similar or lower success rates, likely arising from alterations to the plastic from environmental weathering processes with success rates of 99, 81, 76, and 66% for ATR-FTIR, NIR reflectance spectroscopy, LIBS, and XRF, respectively.

A wide range of marine organisms has been shown to ingest microplastics due to their small dimensions (less than 1 mm). This negatively affects some biological processes, such as feeding, energy reserves and reproduction. Very few studies have been performed on the effect of microplastics on sea urchin development and virtually none on adults. The aim of this work was to evaluate the uptake and distribution of fluorescent labelled polystyrene microbeads (micro-PS) in the Mediterranean sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the potential impact on circulating immune cells. Differential uptake was observed in the digestive and water vascular systems as well as in the gonads based on microbeads size (10 and 45 ??m in diameter). Treatment of sea urchins with particles of both sizes induced an increase of the total number of immune cells already after 24 h. No significant differences were observed among immune cell types. However, the ratio between red and white amoebocytes, indicative of sea urchin healthy status, increased with both particles. This effect was detectable already at 24 h upon exposure to smaller micro-PS (10 ??m). An increase of intracellular levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species was observed at 24 h upon both micro-PS exposure, whereas at later time these levels became comparable to those of controls. A significant increase of total antioxidant capacity was observed after treatment with 10 ??m micro-PS.

This makes the degree of risk uncertain as regards seagrass ecosystems affected by plastic debris, but also it results in several critical knowledge gaps such as to what extent plastic debris can affect food webs supported by seagrasses. In the age of plastics, the Plasticene, the international political agenda shows great interest in this matter. However, to date, no conservation policies have specifically targeted the protection of seagrasses from plastics debris. Future actions should therefore move in two directions: prompting a radical shift in plastics consumption, and shedding further light on plastics-biota interactions in the marine environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
DD7Q8ZK5,10.1177/0003702820920652,Microplastics Differ Between Indoor and Outdoor Air Masses: Insights from Multiple Microscopy Methodologies,"The abundance and distribution of microplastic ('5 mm) has become a growing concern, particularly over the past decade. Research to date has focused on water, soil, and organism matrices but generally disregarded air. We explored airborne microplastic inside and outside of buildings in coastal California by filtering known volumes of air through glass fiber filters, which were then subsequently characterized with a variety of microscopy techniques: gross traditional microscopy, fluorescent microscopy following staining with Nile red, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and micro-Fourier transform infrared (??FT-IR) spectroscopy. Microplastics permeated the air, with indoor (3.3 ?? 2.9 fibers and 12.6 ?? 8.0 fragments m?€?3; mean ?? 1 SD) harboring twice as much as outdoor air (0.6 ?? 0.6 fibers and 5.6 ?? 3.2 fragments m?€?3). Microplastic fiber length did not differ significantly between indoor and outdoor air, but indoor microplastic fragments (58.6 ?? 55 ??m) were half the size of outdoor fragments (104.8 ?? 64.9 ??m). Micro-Raman and FT-IR painted slightly different pictures of airborne plastic compounds, with micro-Raman suggesting polyvinyl chloride dominates indoor air, followed by polyethylene (PE) and ??FT-IR showing polystyrene dominates followed by PE and polyethylene terephthalate. The ubiquity of airborne microplastic points to significant new potential sources of plastic inputs to terrestrial and marine ecosystems and raises significant concerns about inhalation exposure to humans both indoors and outdoors. ??

This research aim was to determine the abundance of microplastic in mangrove periwinkle snail Littoraria scabra and mangrove crab Metopograpsus quadridentata in Pramuka Island, Jakarta Bay, Indonesia. Pramuka Island was chosen as the research site because this island is densely populated and received waste from Jakarta Bay. Samples of mangrove snails were taken by purposive random sampling method of 10 individuals with shell lengths ranging from 1.5 to 2.7 cm, and 9 individuals crab with circa 6 cm carapace wide were collected. Analysis of microplastic abundance was done by isolating microplastic in each sample. Isolation in the sample was done by dissolving tissue of animals in a 65% nitric acid (HNO3) solution for 24 h and sodium chloride (NaCl) was added to increase density of solution. Sample was observed under microscope. The results obtained 3 types of microplastic found in the body of snail (fiber, film, and fragment) and 4 types in crab (fiber, film, fragment, and granula). Fiber has the highest percentage in snail (66.89%) and crab (68.72%). The average of microplastic abundance were 86.88 particles/individual in snail and 327.56 particles/individual in crab, respectively. This result indicated that the coastal area of Pramuka Island has been polluted by the microplastics. There was positive correlation between microplastic abundance and the body weight of snail (r=0.9778), and body weight of crab (r=0.9193). ?? 2020 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

TALTWFRR,10.1038/s41565-020-0707-4,Differentially charged nanoplastics demonstrate distinct accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Although the fates of microplastics (0.1?€?5 mm in size) and nanoplastics (&lt;100 nm) in marine environments are being increasingly well studied1,2, little is known about the behaviour of nanoplastics in terrestrial environments3?€?6, especially agricultural soils7. Previous studies have evaluated the consequences of nanoplastic accumulation in aquatic plants, but there is no direct evidence for the internalization of nanoplastics in terrestrial plants. Here, we show that both positively and negatively charged nanoplastics can accumulate in Arabidopsis thaliana. The aggregation promoted by the growth medium and root exudates limited the uptake of amino-modified polystyrene nanoplastics with positive surface charges. Thus, positively charged nanoplastics accumulated at relatively low levels in the root tips, but these nanoplastics induced a higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species and inhibited plant growth and seedling development more strongly than negatively charged sulfonic-acid-modified nanoplastics. By contrast, the negatively charged nanoplastics were observed frequently in the apoplast and xylem. Our findings provide direct evidence that nanoplastics can accumulate in plants, depending on their surface charge. Plant accumulation of nanoplastics can have both direct ecological effects and implications for agricultural sustainability and food safety. ?? 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",
ZEQ7AL2H,,"Microplastic occurrence in seaturtle nesting beach sediments from Terengganu, Malaysia","Data on the microplastic abundance in sea turtle nesting beaches of Southeast Asia are limited. We sampled four sea turtle nesting beaches in the northern and southern coastal areas of Terengganu, Malaysia between October and November 2018, to investigate microplastic abundance, shape, and colour at both high tide swash zone and dry dunes. Using optical observation, we isolated 2, 489 microplastic items, belong to four types: Fibres, fragments, foam, and films. We found more microplastics at the high tide swash zone (58%) compared to the dune zone. Fibres were the most common shape (96.18%). Of the nine recognised colours found, black was the most abundant (35.64%) followed by transparent (24.53%). Of the sites investigated, those on the northern beaches had a higher abundance of microplastics. The causes of this difference were discussed. This study provides baseline data on microplastic contamination in Terengganu turtle nesting beaches. It highlights the need for further research to identify the effects on sea turtle nesting in this region. ?? 2020 Alpha Publishers. All rights reserved.",

It causes shading, bleaching, physical damage, necrosis, and mortality. This study provides the first evidence that direct contact by plastic and cotton affects coral health within 60 days. In a controlled aquarium experiment, two common Indo-Pacific scleractinian corals, Porites rus and Pavona cactus, were shaded for 60 days by transparent plastic (polypropylene, PP), dark plastic (PP) and cotton. Cotton disintegrated completely after 30 to 42 days, allowing the corals to recover. Transparent plastic became opaque over time due to microfouling, resulting in bleaching of the affected coral parts. Dark plastic had the strongest effect, including bleaching, necrosis and reduced growth within 60 days. Moreover, the two coral species responded differently to the treatments. This is the first report demonstrating that plastic and cotton litter can affect coral health and even cause partial mortality within 60 days. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Polyolefins commonly observed on the seabed, therefore, require additional considerations that are usually based around increasing density through fouling or packaging into sinking faecal matter. Here, however, we propose that the presence of additives is of least equal significance to the behaviour of such plastics in marine systems. We compared barium, present largely as the filler, BaSO4 (density = 4.5 g cm???3), in consumer and beached plastics and established that the metal was more abundant and occurred at higher concentrations in the former samples, consistent with the environmental fractionation of plastics based on additive content. Significantly, the Ba content of polyolefins required to confer a density above seawater is about 13,000 mg kg???1, a value that was exceeded in many consumer plastics but never observed in beached samples. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",

The recent increase in research on the topic, coupled with growing public awareness, has catalyzed policymakers around the world to identify and implement solutions that minimize the harm caused by plastic pollution. To aid and coordinate these efforts, we surveyed experts with scientific experience identified through their peer-reviewed publications. We asked experts about the most pressing research questions relating to how biota interact with plastic pollution that in turn can inform policy decisions and research agendas to best contribute to understanding and reducing the harm of plastic pollution to biota. We used a modified Horizon Scan method that first used a subgroup of experts to generate 46 research questions on aquatic biota and plastics, and then conducted an online survey of researchers globally to prioritize questions in terms of their importance to inform policy development. One hundred and fifteen experts from 29 countries ranked research questions in six themes. The questions were ranked by urgency, indicating which research should be addressed immediately, which can be addressed later, and which are of limited relevance to inform action on plastics as an environmental pollutant. We found that questions relating to the following four themes were the most commonly top-ranked research priorities: (i) sources, circulation and distribution of plastics, (ii) type of harm from plastics, (iii) detection of ingested plastics and the associated problems, and (iv) related economies and policy to ingested plastics. While there are many research questions on the topic of impacts of plastic pollution on biota that could be funded and investigated, our results focus collective priorities in terms of research that experts believe will inform effective policy and on-the-ground conservation. ?? 2020 The Authors",

To understand the possible risks caused by NPTs, it is crucial to determine how they are transported and where they may finally accumulate. Unfortunately, although most sources of plastic are land-based, risk assessments concerning NPTs in the terrestrial environmental system (soils, aquifers, freshwater sediments, etc.) have been largely lacking compared to studies concerning NPTs in the marine system. Furthermore, an important limitation of environmental fate studies is that the NPT models used are questionable in terms of their environmental representativeness. This study describes the fate of different NPT models in a porous media under unfavorable (repulsive) conditions, according to their physical and chemical properties: average hydrodynamic diameters (200?€?460 nm), composition (polystyrene with additives or primary polystyrene) and shape (spherical or polymorphic). NPTs that more closely mimic environmental NPTs present an inhomogeneous shape (i.e., deviating from a sphere) and are more deposited in a sand column by an order of magnitude. This deposition was attributed in part to physical retention, as confirmed by the straining that occurred for the larger size fractions. Additionally, different Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) models -the extended DLVO (XDLVO) and a DLVO modified by surface element integration (SEI) method-suggest that the environmentally relevant NPT models may alter its orientation to diminish repulsion from the sand surface and may find enough kinetic energy to deposit in the primary energetic minimum. These results point to the importance of choosing environmentally relevant NPT models. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Man-made fibres derived from cellulose are distributed worldwide, but are often confused with synthetic plastic fibres and consequently neglected. All these fibres may adversely affect aquatic organisms, but their levels and potential effects in wild fish remain unknown. We analysed anthropogenic fibre (AF) ingestion in the red mullet (Mullus barbatus), at both temporal and geographical scales, to assess potential effects of these fibres on fish health condition. AFs were present in 50% of fish digestive tracts, with a mean of 1.48 AFs per individual (SD = 1.98). In Barcelona, an increase of 46% in AF ingestion was observed in 2018 compared to 2007. AF ingestion also increases by 20% when Barcelona is compared to a less urban area (the town of Blanes). Visual characterization of fibres by typologies?€?corroborated by Raman spectroscopy?€?allowed classification and identification of 88% of AFs as cellulosic (57%), and synthetic polymers (PET) (31%). In all sampling stations, the only histopathological alterations were cysts of unknown etiology, and the most abundant parasites were nematodes. None of these alterations, parasite load, or other fish health indicators (condition indices) indicate an effect of AF ingestion. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

This study quantified phthalates in seabirds collected across >1700 km of the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and contributes to a body of knowledge on plastic contaminants in marine wildlife. We measured six phthalate congeners in seabirds representing ten species and four feeding guilds. Phthalates were detected in 100% of specimens (n = 115), but varied among individuals (3.64?€?539.64 ng/g). DEHP and DBP occurred at an order of magnitude higher than other congeners. Total phthalates did not vary geographically, but differed among feeding guilds, with significantly higher concentrations in diving plankton-feeders compared to others. Plastic particles were detected in 36.5% of randomly subsampled seabird stomachs (n = 74), suggesting plastic ingestion as a potential route of phthalate exposure. Our findings suggest feeding behavior could influence exposure risk for seabirds and lend further evidence to the ubiquity of plastic pollutants in marine ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

This work aims to investigate the presence and abundance of microplastics and fibres in a remote, alpine, and uninhabited lake in Switzerland (Sassolo). In this study, the water column as well as the sediments were analysed. The isolation of microplastics and fibres from the samples of the sediment was achieved with a digestion process using H2O2 and a density separation technique with NaI. Classification of microparticles (from 5 mm to 125 ??m) was first developed with an optical microscope. Infrared spectroscopy was then used to identify and characterize the chemical nature of the microplastics and fibres. On average, 2.6 microplastics and 4.4 fibres per litre were identified in the water column. On the other hand, the results of the sediment samples revealed significant fibre concentrations compared to plastic microparticles (514 fibres and 33 microplastics per kilogram). The most abundant types of microplastic identified in the samples were composed of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). Microplastic and fibre sources were not determined, but it is likely that the number of human activities in this area as well as aerial deposition are contributing to contaminate this remote environment with microplastics and fibres. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

Over the last decade, the amount of research about and attention to the topic have elevated plastic pollution to the global stage?€?and set priori-ties for research and policy. Though the story of plastic pollution, big and small, began decades ago in remote central ocean gyres, we now know that plastic debris is ubiquitous across all ocean basins, ecosystems, habitats, and food webs?€?including in seafood and sea salt. In addition to work on understanding contamination, researchers have expanded their breadth of questioning toward the sources, fates, transforma-tions, and effects of plastic pollution. A deeper understanding has revealed the many ways in which plastic debris interacts with planetary cycles and affects physical and biological processes. An expanding scientific field has paralleled a growing policy movement that spans multiple levels of government from municipal to international. As we continue to conduct research to better understand plastics in our ocean, the questions are no longer about whether there is plastic pollution, but instead: (1) what are the processes and extent to which plastic debris affects global change? (2) will we use science to inform solutions? and (3) are we willing to do the hard work to solve the problem of plastic pollution?. ?? 2020, Oceanography Society. All rights reserved.",
8C65JEDF,10.1016/j.envint.2020.105893,Recycling of European plastic is a pathway for plastic debris in the ocean,"Polyethylene (PE) is one of the most common types of plastic. Whilst an increasing share of post-consumer plastic waste from Europe is collected for recycling, 46% of separated PE waste is exported outside of the source country (including intra-EU trade). The fate of this exported European plastic is not well known. This study integrated data on PE waste flows in 2017 from UN Comtrade, an open repository providing detailed international trade data, with best available information on waste management in destination countries, to model the fate of PE exported for recycling from Europe (EU-28, Norway and Switzerland) into: recycled high-density PE (HDPE) and low-density PE (LDPE) resins, ?€?landfill?€?, incineration and ocean debris. Data uncertainty was reflected in three scenarios representing high, low and average recovery efficiency factors in material recovery facilities and reprocessing facilities, and different ocean debris fate factors. The fates of exported PE were then linked back to the individual European countries of export. Our study estimated that 83,187 Mg (tonnes) (range: 32,115?€?180,558 Mg), or 3% (1?€?7%) of exported European PE in 2017 ended up in the ocean, indicating an important and hitherto undocumented pathway of plastic debris entering the oceans. The countries with the greatest percentage of exported PE ending up as recycled HDPE or LDPE were Luxembourg and Switzerland (90% recycled for all scenarios), whilst the country with the lowest share of exported PE being recycled was the United Kingdom (59?€?80%, average 69% recycled). The results showed strong, significant positive relationships between the percentage of PE exported out of Europe and the percentage of exports which potentially end up as ocean debris. Export countries may not be the ultimate countries of origin owing to complex intra-EU trade in PE waste. Although somewhat uncertain, these mass flows provide pertinent new evidence on the efficacy and risks of current plastic waste management practices pertinent to emerging regulations around trade in plastic waste, and to the development of a more circular economy. ?? 2020 The Authors",

Most likely, the mass of plastic waste entering the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in 2016 was ranged from 155 to 413.4 Kt and 29.2?€?77.9 Kt, respectively. Without implementation of effective waste management strategies, it is estimated that by 2030, the mass of plastic waste entering the Persian Gulf will increase to 199.4?€?531.6 Kt, while in the Gulf of Oman it would be about 40.4?€?107.7 Kt. The entry of plastic waste into the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman has been expected to increase by 29% and 38% in 2030, respectively. As a result, the related cumulative environmental and health effects can be more intensive. It can be emphasized that all countries located in the coastal areas of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman need to modify their solid waste management, plastic waste in particular, policies to conserve sensitive marine ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

MEXPCC6U,10.1016/j.watres.2020.115978,Protein corona-mediated transport of nanoplastics in seawater-saturated porous media,"The offshore aquaculture environment is a potential water area with high concentrations of tiny plastics and feeding proteins. In this study, the negatively charged bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the positively charged lysozyme (LSZ) were used to explore the effects of protein corona on the aggregation, transport, and retention of polystyrene nanoplastics (NPs; 200, 500, and 1000 nm) in sea sand saturated with seawater of 35 practical salinity units (PSU). The BSA corona, which was formed by the adsorption of BSA on the surface of NPs, drove the dispersion of NPs (200 and 500 nm) due dominantly to the induced colloidal steric hindrance. For example, the aggregate sizes of 500 nm NP decreased from 1740 ?? 87 nm to 765 ?? 8 nm at 40 min, which resulted in the enhanced transportation of NP. The calculated interaction energies indicated the BSA corona-induced high energy barriers (&gt;104 KBT) between 1000 nm NPs and sand surface, demonstrating the BSA-enhanced transport of 1000 nm NPs. The mass percentage recovered from the effluent (Meff) increased from 33.4% to 61.7%. Inversely, the LSZ corona triggered the aggregation of 200 nm NPs into the large aggregates via electrostatic adsorption and bridging effect, thereby inhibiting the transport of 200 nm NPs. Nevertheless, no LSZ corona was formed on the surface of 500 and 1000 nm NPs due to extremely low protein adsorption. Accordingly, LSZ cannot affect the stability and transport of these NPs. In the diluted seawater (3.5 PSU), the strong electrostatic attraction between positively charged LSZ and 500 nm NPs significantly increased and the LSZ corona formed, which induced the aggregation of 500 nm NPs. The Meff of NPs therefore decreased from 53.1% to 11.2%. Overall, the protein corona-mediated transport of NPs in seawater-saturated porous media depends on protein type, NP size, and seawater salinity. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Data was collected from all birds retrieved from the Audubon Center for Birds of Prey in central Florida, USA from January to May 2018. Individuals were either dead prior to reaching the Center or died within 24 h of arrival with no food consumed during captivity. Sixty-three individuals representing eight species were dissected to extract the gastrointestinal (GI) tract from the esophagus to the large intestine. Microplastics were found in the GI tracts in all examined species and in all individual birds. The overall mean number (??S.E.) of microplastics for species of bird of prey in central Florida was 11.9 (??2.8), and the overall mean number of microplastics per gram of GI tract tissue was 0.3 (??0.1). A total of 1197 pieces of plastic were recorded. Microfibers accounted for 86% of total plastics followed by microfragments (13%), macroplastics (0.7%) and microbeads (0.3%). Most fibers were either clear or royal blue in color. Micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (??-FTIR) found that processed cellulose was the most common polymer identified in birds (37%), followed by polyethylene terephthalate (16%) and a polymer blend (4:1) of polyamide-6 and poly(ethylene-co-polypropylene) (11%). Two bird species, Buteo lineatus (red-shouldered hawk, n = 28) and Pandion haliaetus (osprey, n = 16), were sufficiently abundant to enable statistical analyses. Microplastics were significantly more abundant per gram in the gastrointestinal tract tissue of B. lineatus, that consumes small mammals, snakes, and amphibians, than in fish-feeding P. haliaetus (ANOVA: p = 0.013). If raptors in terrestrial food webs have higher densities of microplastics than aquatic top predators, then it potentially could be due to a combination of direct intake of plastics and indirect consumption via trophic transfer. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The organic UV-filter, oxybenzone (BP-3) is a constituent of sunscreens and personal care products, entering the marine environment either by direct contact with swimmers or by wastewater effluents. In this study the ecotoxicological effects of exposure to low-density polyethylene (LDPE) microplastics with and without adsorbed BP-3 were investigated in the peppery furrow shell clam, Scrobicularia plana. LDPE microplastics with a size range of 11?€?13 ??m were previously contaminated with an environmentally relevant concentration of BP-3 (82 ng g???1). S. plana individuals were exposed to a concentration of 1 mg L???1 of microplastics with and without BP-3 adsorbed in a water-sediment exposure system for 14 days. Clams were sampled at the beginning of the experiment and after 3, 7, and 14 days of exposure. Multiple biomarkers were analysed to investigate the effect of exposure in different clam tissues, gills, digestive gland, and haemolymph. Antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) and biotransformation (glutathione-S-transferases) enzyme activities, oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation), genotoxicity (single and double strand DNA breaks), and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase activity) were assessed along with two biomarker indexes to assess the overall health status. Results indicate that after 7 days of exposure MPs with adsorbed BP-3 induced oxidative stress and damage, when compared to exposure to virgin MPs and control treatments. Neurotoxic effects were also noted in MPs with adsorbed BP-3 after 14 days exposure, while some evidence points to increased genotoxicity with exposure time. Overall results indicate that gills were more affected by exposure to microplastics than digestive gland and that biomarkers alterations are apparently more related to the toxicity of BP-3 adsorbed than virgin MPs alone. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

N7NZQF7D,10.1007/s00343-020-0129-z,Application of confocal laser Raman spectroscopy on marine sediment microplastics,"Marine sediment is the primary sink of microplastics and is an indicator of pollution levels. However, although there are well-developed detection methods, detection is rarely focused on low-micrometer-sized particles, mainly due to technique limitations. In this study, a simplified process omitting digestion procedures was developed to pretreat microplastics obtained from marine sediment and was coupled with micro-Raman spectroscopy to identify microplastics. Based on the overall analysis of the characteristic peak assignments, a Raman spectral reference library was constructed for 18 types of plastic. In addition, the effects of the measurement parameters were systematically described. Field research was then conducted to validate the developed process and investigate microplastic contamination in Huiquan Bay, Qingdao, China. This simplified process could retain the original appearance of microparticles and accomplish the detection of <500 ??m-sized microplastics in environmental samples. Microplastics in the size range of 10?€?150 ??m accounted for 76% of all microplastics, and 56% of the total particles was particles smaller than 50 ??m. Polypropylene (42%) and polyethylene (20%) were predominant components of the particles. In particular, polypropylene particles smaller than 10 ??m were identified in marine sediment. This work demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy is not only an effective tool for detecting environmental particles but also highly applicable for identifying particles extracted from marine sediment. ?? 2020, Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",
8BKLUIK8,10.1371/journal.pone.0238650,Resolution dependency of sinking Lagrangian particles in ocean general circulation models,"Any type of non-buoyant material in the ocean is transported horizontally by currents during its sinking journey. This lateral transport can be far from negligible for small sinking velocities. To estimate its magnitude and direction, the material is often modelled as a set of Lagrangian particles advected by current velocities that are obtained from Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs). State-of-the-art OGCMs are strongly eddying, similar to the real ocean, providing results with a spatial resolution on the order of 10 km on a daily frequency. While the importance of eddies in OGCMs is well-appreciated in the physical oceanographic community, other marine research communities may not. Further, many long term climate modelling simulations (e.g. in paleoclimate) rely on lower spatial resolution models that do not capture mesoscale features. To demonstrate how much the absence of mesoscale features in low-resolution models influences the Lagrangian particle transport, we simulate the transport of sinking Lagrangian particles using low- and high-resolution global OGCMs, and assess the lateral transport differences resulting from the difference in spatial and temporal model resolution. We find major differences between the transport in the non-eddying OGCM and in the eddying OGCM. Addition of stochastic noise to the particle trajectories in the non-eddying OGCM parameterises the effect of eddies well in some cases (e.g. in the North Pacific gyre). The effect of a coarser temporal resolution (once every 5 days versus monthly) is smaller compared to a coarser spatial resolution (0.1?? versus 1?? horizontally). We recommend to use sinking Lagrangian particles, representing e.g. marine snow, microplankton or sinking plastic, only with velocity fields from eddying Eulerian OGCMs, requiring high-resolution models in e.g. paleoceanographic studies. To increase the accessibility of our particle trace simulations, we launch planktondrift.science.uu.nl, an online tool to reconstruct the surface origin of sedimentary particles in a specific location. ?? 2020 Nooteboom et al.

UD53J9UZ,10.1126/SCIENCE.ABA3656,Predicted growth in plastic waste exceeds efforts to mitigate plastic pollution,"Plastic pollution is a planetary threat, affecting nearly every marine and freshwater ecosystem globally. In response, multilevel mitigation strategies are being adopted but with a lack of quantitative assessment of how such strategies reduce plastic emissions. We assessed the impact of three broad management strategies, plastic waste reduction, waste management, and environmental recovery, at different levels of effort to estimate plastic emissions to 2030 for 173 countries. We estimate that 19 to 23 million metric tons, or 11%, of plastic waste generated globally in 2016 entered aquatic ecosystems. Considering the ambitious commitments currently set by governments, annual emissions may reach up to 53 million metric tons per year by 2030. To reduce emissions to a level well below this prediction, extraordinary efforts to transform the global plastics economy are needed. ?? 2020 The Authors.",

Ocean eddies can retain zooplankton and plastic debris, and determine biological composition through advection. The conditions inside the gyre were stabilised by low chlorophyll-a concentrations and a deep nutricline. A diverse assemblage of mesopelagic fish, dominated by myctophids, exhibited diel migrations to the upper water layers for feeding since the early night. Myctophids were concentrated ca. 100 m depth, where the deep chlorophyll maximum was located, and coinciding with the nutricline. Another group of mesopelagic fish remained in deeper waters during the daytime, with a higher occurrence of Stomiiformes (Phoshycthyidae and Sternoptychidae) at the 500?€?600 m Deep Scattering Layer. Moreover, the diets of 220 myctophid specimens belonging to the species Ceratoscopelus warmingii, Diaphus effulgens, and Symbolophorus evermanni, were investigated based on stomach content analysis. Calanoid copepods, mainly Pleuromamma abdominalis, made up 30% of the diet in the three myctophid species, with interspecific differences in the preferred second item: C. warmingii preferred ostracods, D. effulgens, non-calanoid copepods, and S. evermanni, euphausiids. Thus, partial dietary segregation was observed among the three species. We hypothesized that these myctophid diets differed between stations located at the gyre core and its outer edge. Any dietary pattern indicating aggregation of food resources, or an enhancement of the foraging opportunities for myctophids, was discerned as an effect of the gyre advection. However, prey composition diverged between the core and the outer edge stations regardless of the fish species, with a higher dietary representation of P. abdominalis and euphausiids (migratory zooplankton) in the individuals collected in the core-influenced area. A total of six plastic pieces were present in the stomachs of D. effulgens and S. evermanni, in contrast with the high presence of plastic particles found at the surface in most sampling stations (average number of plastic pieces was 41 per hour). The selected myctophid species did not appear to be important transport vectors for microplastics in comparison with species from other oceans. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Both species were exposed to 2-??m fluorescent PS-MPs (107 beads/L) for 3 weeks. The bioaccumulation factor of PS-MPs for Java medaka was calculated at about 4 ?? 102, higher than that for Japanese medaka (about 1 ?? 102). The exposure had no significant effects on the survival and reproduction of Japanese medaka. The mRNA sequencing analysis showed that the expression of a few genes involved in the cell adhesion, xenobiotic metabolic process, brain development, and other functions in medaka intestines significantly changed after exposure. These results suggest that virgin PS-MPs can potentially accumulate in medaka intestines, but has limited toxicity to Japanese medaka at the concentration up to 107 beads/L. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Microplastics (MPs, &lt;5 mm) can be found either as microbeads in body care and some industrial products or as plastic debris through degradation. Plastic microbeads (1?€?5 ??m, fluorescent, Cospheric) were used to characterise the MP ingestion and determine their potential harmful effects on both the swimming behaviour and development of oyster D-larvae (Crassostrea gigas). For 24 h, embryos were first exposed to MPs at a temperature of 24 ??C. In addition, 3 day-old D-larvae were exposed to the same temperature for 1, 3 and 5 h. Three concentrations of MPs were used: 0.1, 1 and 10 mg MP. L???1. After a 24-h period of embryonic exposure, we noted that MP agglomerates were stuck to the D-larvae coat and locomotor eyelashes. We also observed a significant increase in severe malformations and developmental arrests for larvae exposed to MPs ranging from 1 mg MP. L???1. In terms of swimming behaviour, the maximum speed recorded was lower for larvae exposed at 0.1 and 1 mg MP. L???1.

PLEJ5CCS,10.3390/TOXICS8030059,Adsorption and desorption behaviour of polychlorinated biphenyls onto microplastics' surfaces in water/sediment systems,"The potential of microplastics (MPLs) in marine ecosystems to adsorb and transport other micropollutants to biota, contributing to their entry in the food chain, is a primary cause of concern. However, these interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we have evaluated the adsorption/desorption behaviour of marker polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), onto MPL surfaces of three widely used polymers-polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The range of MPL sizes ranged from 1 to 600 ??m. The adsorption/desorption was evaluated in sediment/water systems in marine microcosms emulating realistic environmental conditions for 21 days. The adsorption percentages ranged from 20 to 60%. PCBs with a lower degree of chlorination showed higher adsorption percentages because of conformational impediments of PCBs with high-degree chlorination, and also by their affinity to be adsorbed in sediments. Glassy plastic polymers as PET and PS showed a superior affinity for PCBs than rubbery polymers, such as PE. The polymers that can bond PCBs by p-p interactions, rather than van der Waals forces showed better adsorption percentages, as expected. Finally, the adsorption/desorption behaviour of selected PCBs onto MPLs was fitted to a Freundlich isotherm model, with correlations higher than 0.8 in most of the cases. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

In this study, clean estuarine sediment has been contaminated by different microplastics prepared from pre-characterised samples of different types of plastic (including a rubber) containing a range of Sb concentrations (256-47,600 ??g g-1). Sediment-plastic mixtures in a mass ratio of 100:1 were subject to 6-h extractions in seawater and in seawater solutions of a protein (bovine serum albumin; BSA) and a surfactant (taurocholic acid; TA) that mimic the digestive conditions of coastal deposit-feeding invertebrates. Most time-courses for Sb mobilisation could be defined by a second-order diffusion equation, with rate constants ranging from 44.6 to 0.0216 (??g g-1)-1 min-1. Bioaccessibilities, defined as maximum extractable concentrations throughout each time course relative to total Sb content, ranged from <0.01% for a polycarbonate impregnated with Sb as a synergist exposed to all solutions, to >1% for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene containing a Sb-based colour pigment exposed to solutions of BSA and TA and recycled industrial polyethylene exposed to BSA solution. The potential for Sb to bioaccumulate or elicit a toxic effect is unknown but it is predicted that communities of deposit-feeders could mobilise significant quantities of Sb in sediment contaminated by microplastics through bioturbation and digestion.

8XHKSGY2,10.1007/s11367-020-01786-w,In pursuit of environmentally friendly straws: a comparative life cycle assessment of five straw material options in South Africa,"Purpose: The increasing global concern surrounding plastic pollution has resulted in a spotlight being placed on major contributors. Straws have been identified as a top contributor in this regard leading to a global outcry against plastic straws. This has resulted in the increasing popularity of plastic straw material alternatives. This study compares the environmental impacts associated with five straw material options available in South Africa. Methods: The straw materials compared include disposable options (polypropylene, paper and polylactide) and reusable straws (glass and steel). Plastic straws were the only option which are locally produced from local materials, whereas glass and steel straws are manufactured from imported materials and paper and polylactide straws are imported. The functional unit was based on an annual straw consumption per capita, which equates to 36 disposable straws and 1 reusable straw. The impact assessment was conducted using the Recipe Midpoint (H) method, which took into consideration 18 impact categories. The potential marine pollution impacts were explored based on the leakage propensity of the material option coupled with its degradability. Results and discussion: The paper straw was found to have lower climate change emissions than the plastic one, which was mainly caused by the performance of the material. In South Africa, coal is used as a primary feedstock for polypropylene production making it more carbon-intensive in comparison with polypropylene produced in Europe and the USA which is primarily from crude oil and/or natural gas feedstocks. Glass and steel straws would require 23?€?39 and 37?€?63 uses respectively to break even with climate change emissions associated with disposable options. Overall, material production was the major contributor to straw emissions. The relative contribution of transportation, including import, was more dependent on the transportation mode compared with distance. For reusable straws, the washing water temperature was found to notably influence emissions. At end-of-life, reusable straws were considered unlikely to enter the marine environments. Disposable straws were found to have a leakage rate of 38%, with paper being the only marine degradable material. Conclusions: Overall, paper straws had the least impacts in the majority of impact categories in comparison with other disposable options and glass was more favourable to steel. In terms of marine pollution, reusable straws were deemed to pose the least risk due to their unlikelihood to be polluted. Paper was associated with the least potential impacts of the disposal options, due to its degradability. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

The safety of manned cabin has a decisive effect on the whole system. Ti-6Al-4V with the superior strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance has been used for the manned cabin. The manned cabin experiences loading spectrum with different maximum stresses and different dwell time during their service life. The load sequence effects on dwell fatigue crack growth behavior of Ti-6Al-4V under different dwell time are investigated experimentally in this paper. The experimental results show that the crack tip plastic zone is enlarged by the dwell time and the overload retardation zone increases with dwell time under the same overload rate. A dwell fatigue crack growth model is proposed by modifying the crack tip plastic zone under the loading history with combinations of the single overload and dwell time factors are included in the modified model. Based on the experimental data, the overload retardation zone and the crack growth rates of Ti-6Al-4V are predicted by the modified model. A reasonable model for the load sequence effect on the dwell fatigue crack growth rates of Ti-6Al-4V is verified. ?? 2020, Chinese Ocean Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

Seventy-two percent of fulmars and 15% of kittiwakes ingested plastic, while guillemots and murres did not. The number and mass of plastic ingested by fulmars decreased between the two periods (2008 and 2018), but the frequency of occurrence of plastic ingestion did not change, although sample sizes were less than ideal.

Beaches close to urban areas had a higher number of litter categories (i.e. plastic, metal, foam, and paper) compared to the remote beaches that only had plastics. In conclusion, the lack of statistically significant evidence of the influence of proximity to urban centers, the predominant activity in the beaches, and exposure to wave action on the amount of meso-litter attest to the fact that marine litter pollution is a geographical spread problem that will require national, regional, and global action and approach to address.

A total of 53 Vibrio spp. isolates were cultured from different ecological niches in a marine aquarium including microplastic (MP) and sandy sediment particles (12 weeks after added sterile to the system), detritus, and the surrounding aquarium water. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) the isolates were assigned to seven different phylotypes. Six phylotypes were identified by high probability to the species level. The highest phylotype diversity was cultured from detritus and water (six out of seven phylotypes), while only two phylotypes were cultured from MP and sediment particles. Genomic fingerprinting indicated an even higher genetic diversity of Vibrio spp. at the strain (genotype) level.

In this study, poly (glycerol maleate) (PGM) is applied as the alternative of microbeads due to its high degradability in the water and the relatively low cost compared to other biodegradable polymers. The proposed PGM microbeads are fabricated via solvent evaporation methods with average diameter around 30 ?? 13 ??m and polydispersity index around 0.2 to 0.3. To identify the degradability of PGM microbeads in different water solutions, samples were examined in buffer solution with different pH values, DI water, sea water and enzyme solution through total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer/UV?€?Vis spectrometry, microscopy, and SEM. These microbeads were completely degraded in 45 min in alkaline solution (pH 10). In contrast, 60% of PGM microbeads were degraded in 30 days in the acidic solution (pH 4). It revealed that the base catalysis of hydrolysis was quicker than acid-catalysis. 50% more of PGM microbeads were degraded in the refreshed DI water in a month. However, only 36% of microbeads were degraded in synthetic sea water. The high salinity was suspected to obstruct the hydrolysis of PGM microbeads and slow down the degradation rate. Lipase solution is conducted to examine the possibility of bio-accumulation once PGM microbeads ingested inside the living organism, and the result shows that PGM microbeads degrade mostly in seven days. It is worthy to note that PLA microbeads only degrade at pH 10 in this study. With the comparison between PGM and PLA microbeads, PGM is more easily degraded and affordable, and it is thought to have great potential for being the alternative to plastic microbeads. ?? 2020",

A total of 29 individuals of the insect species were chemically digested and subsequently analysed for MP presence under a digital microscope and a micro-Fourier-transform infrared (??FTIR) spectroscope. Collector-gatherers (Chironomus sp. and Siphlonurus sp.) recorded the highest MP load per gram wet weight, while the predatory Lestes viridis recorded the lowest.

Dielectric polymers are typically required for TENG to create static charges, which, however, may produce plastic litters to the ocean after its service. In this work, seawater degradable dielectric polymers are investigated for the applications in TENGs. A promising polymer blend (noted as PLA/PLGA), consisted from seawater-degradation-favorable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and nonseawater-degradable polylatic acid (PLA), shows a mild rate degradation in seawater and complete weight loss within 9 months. Furthermore, the PLA/PLGA is found to be tribo-positive with excellent electrification properties, and is mechanically robust. Then, a hollow-plate-shaped seawater degradable TENG (SD-TENG) is designed using PLA/PLGA as the electrification layer and Mg as the electrode, which demonstrates the ability to convert water wave vibration energy into electricity. This SD-TENG demonstrates a clean approach to exploit the ocean wave energy, and may supply power for future temporary marine instruments without maintenances and environmental damages. ?? 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Correlations in land/seafloor debris type/density occurred primarily for items which entangle and/or sink, with low correlation for floating items, with implications for debris survey methodology and policy interventions. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Pollution of coastal and marine environments by mismanaged anthropogenic debris is a global threat requiring complex, multilateral solutions and mitigation strategies. International efforts to catalogue and quantify the density, extent and nature of mismanaged waste have not yet assessed the heterogeneity of debris between nearby areas. Better understanding of how debris types and density can be used as a proxy between regions and between land and seafloor habitats at a global scale can aid in developing cost effective and representative debris monitoring systems. Using volunteer collected clean-up and survey data, we compared the proportion and density of both total debris and specific items across 19,428 coastal land and seafloor sites from International Coastal Cleanups and Dive Against Debris surveys, from 86 countries between 2011 and 2018. We show that although some items common on land are also common on the seafloor, there is an overall global mismatch between debris types and densities on land and the seafloor from nearby areas. Correlations in land/seafloor debris type/density occurred primarily for items which entangle and/or sink, including fishing line, plastic bags, glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. Minimal similarity between land and seafloor surveys occurs for items which float or degrade. We suggest that to accurately evaluate local debris density, land and seafloor surveys are required to gain a holistic understanding. When detailed information on debris type, relative concentration, and likely source and transport are assessed, more cost effective and efficient policy interventions can be designed and implemented from local through to global scales. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
HPU7TBUH,10.1111/1365-2435.13635,Diatom defence: Grazer induction and cost of shell-thickening,"Diatoms account for 40% of the ocean primary production and play a key role in the oceans?€? ability to sequester carbon. The evolutionary success of diatoms and their role in ocean biogeochemistry are related to the siliceous shell that provide partial protection against grazing. The structure and function of phytoplankton communities are governed by environmental constraints and organismal trade-offs. Defence mechanisms may help explain the high diversity of phytoplankton (incl. diatoms) in the ocean, but only if the defence comes at a cost. Defence costs have been notoriously difficult to demonstrate and quantify in marine phytoplankton. Here, we demonstrate for seven species of planktonic diatoms that their shell thickens and their growth rate declines when cells are exposed to chemical cues from copepods, important predators of diatoms. The responses are proportional to the concentration of grazer cues, but are also highly variable, both between and within species. At our standard experimental condition, the typical decline in growth rate is 10%, and the typical increase in cellular biogenic silica is 16%. The latter value corresponds to a decline in grazing mortality due to small copepods of 11%. Thus, silification in response to grazers is exactly warranted. The similar magnitude of the costs and benefits of silification suggests a flat fitness landscape along the competition-defence axis. This may help explain the high diversity of coexisting diatoms in the ocean. The significant but variable contribution of diatoms to the downward flux of organic carbon in the ocean depends to a large extent on the silica content of the cells. This is due less to the ballasting effect of silica, but mainly to the different life histories of more or less defended cells that are governed by evolutionary adaptations and?€?as demonstrated here?€?plastic responses to grazers.

In this work, a series of fluorinated diols modified polythiourethane (HO-FPTU-x) have been synthesized via a simple and convenient polymerization reaction with HDI, PETMP and various of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-benzenedimethanol (HOCH2-FB-Al) at the room temperature, and their antifouling properties are explored as well. The laboratory assays and marine field tests (6 months) show that the HO-FPTU-7.5 (with 7.5 wt% HOCH2-FB-Al) coating has shown excellent antifouling/fouling release properties. The side chains of the HO-FPTU polymers simultaneously contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, which construct an ?€?ambiguous?€??€? surface after immersing into water. The marine organisms may be ?€?confused?€??€? by the ?€?ambiguous?€??€? surface and be removed easily during settlement and adhesion. This work provides a facile strategy for designing environment friendly marine antifouling coatings. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

The main objective of the current work was to investigate the response of an oxo-biodegradable commercial plastic film product to photo-degradation using accelerated weathering, verifying the claim of its biodegradability and suitability as an eco-friendly product. This study is also geared towards the appropriateness of such products to reduce plastic waste accumulation in urban environments. The film samples were exposed to weathering as a means to determine the impact of UV induced oxo-biodegradation. Haze (%), light transmission (%) and the total change in colour (??E) were measured as indicators to the degradation profile of the polymeric materials, in addition to tensile pull mechanical properties and thermal stability. The melting peak indicates the melting point (Tm) of the polymer and with exposure to weathering it showed a slight decrease from 105 to 102 ??C indicating that biodegradation mechanisms were triggered to a certain extent. The reduction in strain at rupture was also indicative for a loss in crystalline structure, coupled with Young?€?s modulus increase throughout the weathering exposure tests. Therefore, the material studied could be a candidate to mitigate the accumulation of plastic waste in open environments based on the results of this study whilst regulating controlled substances.

Only 9% of the plastics that are currently produced are recycled while most of these materialsend up in landfills or leak into oceans, thus creating severe environmental challenges. Covalentadaptable networks (CANs) materials can play a significant role in reducing the burden posed byplastics materials on the environment because CANs are reusable and recyclable. This review isfocused on recent research related to CANs of polycarbonates, polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes, and polyurea. In particular, trends in self-healing CANs systems, the market value of these materials, as well as mechanistic insights regarding polycarbonates, polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes, and polyurea are highlighted in this review.

KGGP9DMM,10.1002/jez.b.23001,"Effect of dopamine on early larvae of sea urchins, Mesocentrotus nudus and Strongylocentrotus intermedius","Larvae of many echinoids are known to be phenotypically plastic and capable of changing the growth rate of their post-oral arms depending on the microalgae concentration in their habitat. As literature data show, developing larvae use chemosensation to detect algae in the environment and ?€?adjust?€? the rate of growth of their post-oral arms through dopamine signaling. According to our results, dopamine has a significant effect on the post-oral arm growth in early larvae of two sea urchin species, Mesocentrotus nudus and Strongylocentrotus intermedius. The dopamine effect depends on concentration: the higher the dopamine concentration in the water, the shorter the post-oral arms. We suggest that the pattern of response to variation in dopamine concentration, manifested by early larvae of both species, is similar to that observed at different concentrations of microalgae. ?? 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",

Experiments and finite element model (FEM) of the hybrid circular tubes subjected to three-point bending and axial compression were performed, and the finite element models were validated. The effects of fiber filament winding angle (??) and aluminum wall thickness (t) on energy absorption characteristic of the hybrid tube under three-point bending and axial compressive were discussed by FEM. The results show that ?? and t have different effects on the specific energy absorption (SEA) of the hybrid tube under three-point bending and axial compression, respectively. A five-order polynomial response surface (PRS) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to connect variables (?? and t) and the objective (SEA), respectively. It was found that the fitting accuracy of ANN was better. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGAII) was applied to obtain optimal results in the form of Pareto frontier solutions. The specific energy absorption of the optimized hybrid tube (?? = 24??, t = 1.45 mm) verified by simulation under three-point bending and axial compression is 1.11 kN/kg and 45.59 kN/kg, respectively. The hybrid tube exhibits better specific energy absorption under both loads. ?? 2020, ASM International.",
K44MQ224,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121640,Production and optimization of eco-bricks,"Waste plastics are often indiscriminately disposed into the built environment and sometimes voyaged into the sea, constitute nuisance to the built environment and disturb aquatic life. These threats have birthed researches for the promotion of circular economy in plastic waste management. However, few studies have investigated the use of waste plastic in the production of eco-bricks. This study examined the effect of moisture content and soil types on the characterisation of eco-bricks under compressive load. Samples of eco-bricks were produced using laterite, sharp sand and stone dust at 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% moisture contents as infill materials. The soil samples were tested of specific gravity, fineness modulus and uniformity coefficient computation to determine the suitability of the samples, while the eco-bricks produced with the soil samples were subjected to compressive load. The study found a positive relationship between soil moisture content and compressive strength of eco-bricks produced with sharp sand and stone dust while the compressive strength of laterite bottle bricks had a negative relationship with the moisture content. Also, the specific strength, Poisson's ratio and bulk density of the eco-bricks were satisfactory at varying soil moisture contents. The study concludes that soil moisture content affects the performance of bottle bricks and adequate consideration for soil types in the production of eco-bricks is paramount. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In this study, quasi-static compression tests were carried out to experimentally investigate the crushing behaviors of foam-filled aluminum/CFRP hybrid tube subject to transverse loading condition. Based upon the experimental tests and numerical modeling, the interactive effects in between the aluminum foam filler and aluminum/CFRP hybrid tube was explored. It is found that the load carrying and energy absorption capacities of foam-filled hybrid tube were significantly improved in comparison with the summation of net foam filler and empty hybrid tube. The parametric study was carried out for exploring the effects of the aluminum foam density, aluminum tube thickness and ply number of CFRP tube on the crushing behaviors of foam-filled hybrid tube. It is found that both the total energy absorption (EA) of foam-filled hybrid tubes and the EA contributions of the aluminum foam (or aluminum tube, or CFRP tube) were enhanced with increase in density (or thickness, or ply number). The specific energy absorption (SEA) of foam-filled hybrid tubes increased from 3.45 J/g to 9.24 J/g with the foam density changed from 0.23 g cm???3 to 0.70 g cm???3; nevertheless, increase in aluminum tube thickness (or ply number of CFRP tube) has no evident influence on the SEA of foam-filled hybrid tubes. Finally, discrete design optimization was further performed to obtain the best possible foam-filled hybrid configuration for the transverse crushing characteristics. The optimum results showed that the SEA was largely improved by 213% in comparison with the baseline design. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The main objective of the model is to investigate the effects of different feedstock compositions on key parameters, such as electrical power produced and heat recovered. The different types of waste generated onboard are described along with their environmental impacts. Specific attention is given to solid wastes, sewage sludge and plastic wastes as potential feedstock. Their average generation, proximate and ultimate analysis are defined, as input to the process model. The process assumptions used in the simulation model are illustrated. The system model is divided into five units: the pre-treatment unit; the gasification unit; the syngas cleaning unit; the energy conversion unit; and the heat recovery unit. Four operational scenarios are investigated to consider several variations of composition of the main feedstock. From the results of the simulations, the system model shows good feedstock flexibility, and the possibility of operating in net electricity gain conditions. The cold gas efficiency of the process is also assessed and its maximum value is obtained for the highest concentrations of sewage sludge (33.3%) and plastic (16.7%). Other parameters investigated are the combustion temperature, sorbent consumption in the cleaning process, feedstock and syngas lower heating value LHV. ?? 2020 by the authors.

IUA3IYNN,10.3390/ma13173907,Long-term cyclic loading impact on the creep deformation mechanism in cohesive materials,"Long-term cyclic loading is observed in a wide range of human activities, as well as in nature, such as in the case of ocean waves. Cyclic loading can lead to ratcheting which is defined as progressive accumulation of plastic deformation in a material. Long-term cyclic loading causes a time effect (creep), which is a secondary compression effect. In this article, we conducted 15 triaxial tests on four types of cohesive materials in undrained conditions to evaluate the damage and failure mechanism. To characterize the strain and pore pressure development, we modified the Yanbu resistance concept. On the basis of the static creep tests, we concluded that the stress paths for undrained creep behavior have to take into account the pore pressure developed during long-term cyclic loading. Pore pressure build-up and plastic strain accumulation during long-term cyclic loading are dependent on the number of loading cycles. Finally, we proposed the failure criterion, which was based on the Modified Cam-Clay constitutive model. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

Seven compact and semicompact S355J2H cold-formed circular-hollow sections with diameter to thickness (D/t) ratios between 20 to 60, representative of piles used in piers and wharves, were brought to failure in three-point cyclic bending tests. Digital image correlation was employed to estimate average cross-sectional curvatures, and hence the critical bending strains, during local buckling at the midspan plastic hinges. These estimates were compared against those from two simplified localized hinge models and differed by up to a factor of two. A parametric study was performed with a validated finite-element model to ascertain the suitability of proposed design equations at predicting critical strains in piles with D/t from 20 to 60 under cyclic loading. Test and simulation data both show that critical buckling strains are lower under cyclic loading than under monotonic loading.

The thin-walled CFRP tubes were performed by the quasi-static compression test, which were fabricated using the wet winding technique. The result was concluded that as the winding angle increased, the compressive modulus showed the decreasing trend. In the view of energy absorption (EA) and specific energy absorption (SEA), it was exhibited the decreasing trend as the winding angle increased.

Understanding the plasticity of responses in common reef-building corals to oscillations in pCO2 will allow for better predictions of their function in future seawater conditions. This study explored the effects of variation in seawater pCO2 on coral calcification using experiments conducted over one month between 9 April 2018 and 18 May 2018. Branches ( 4-cm long) of Acropora retusa were sampled from colonies at 10-m depth on the fore reef of Mo'orea, French Polynesia (17?? 28?€? 53.9004"" S, 149?? 49?€? 50.5992"" W). We tested the hypothesis that depressed calcification caused by elevated pCO2 ( 1000 ??atm) is relaxed (i.e., calcification increases) upon return to ambient pCO2 ( 400 ??atm). Corals first were incubated in ambient or elevated pCO2 for 19 days, with the result that calcification integrated over this period was reduced by 31% under elevated pCO2. The same corals were then incubated at ambient pCO2 for 11 days, during which calcification was independent of the experimental pCO2 exposure history. Our results suggest that a quick relaxation of pCO2-depressed calcification in A. retusa following cessation of high pCO2 indicates that corals are capable of a reversible plastic response of calcification when confronted by pCO2 oscillations. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

The bearded fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) is a large corallivorous amphinomid polychaete, with a high tolerance of environmental stress, including temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen (DO). Currently, little is known about the response of H. carunculata to chronic (??? 18 h) hypoxia, although this knowledge is crucial to understand its impact on coral reef health under hypoxia scenarios. We tested the hypothesis that the number of branchial filaments (previously used as a diagnostic character for species identification) increases in response to chronic hypoxia. We subjected wild-caught fireworms to two levels of reduced DO (Mid: 4.5 ?? 0.25 mg O2 L???1 and Low: 2.5 ?? 0.25 mg O2 L???1) to explore their morphological and physiological responses to seven days of chronic hypoxia. Hypoxia exposure resulted in a higher number of branchial filaments (low = 57.2 ?? 5.3, mid = 57.4 ?? 6.1, and normal = 47.4 ?? 11.2) after seven days. Fireworms exposed to hypoxia further reduced their rate of regeneration, but returned to normal regenerative rates after fifteen weeks under normoxic conditions. There was no difference in regeneration rates between low and mid DO groups. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering multiple physiological and morphological endpoints as well as phenotypic plasticity in species delimitations. Indeed, the results suggest that morphological variation can be indicative of environmental conditions. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

Hierarchical (slotted) and non-hierarchical specimens including hexagonal, re-entrant and asymmetric re-entrant have been 3D printed by using PLA plastic and tested under edgewise compression along the in-plane directions. The material properties of the PLA plastics have been determined via tensile tests, and Finite Element analyses have been performed using the LS-DYNA code to benchmark force-displacement curves with the experimental results. The numerical models were validated by comparing the load-displacement responses with the experimental results for each sample. Linear elastic properties, crashworthiness and energy absorption capability of the novel honeycomb structures are evaluated from the experimental and numerical standpoint. Specific metrics like compressive normalized modulus, compressive strength and specific energy absorption (SEA) are evaluated. The Poisson's ratio of the novel honeycomb configurations has been evaluated and the impact of the deformation mechanisms of the different cellular shapes during crashworthiness has been studied. The results show that the use of the slotted and asymmetric cells proposed in this work could increase strength, stiffness and energy absorption capacity and also increase the stability of the samples during deformation. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

One flat panel and one hat-shaped shell were prepared via a high temperature and pressure molding process first, and then were joined together via (a) adhesive bonding and (b) hybrid bonding and riveting, to form the T-shaped thin-walled tubular joints. Drop weight impact tests were conducted for the T-joints with three impact velocities. Load-time/displacement curves were measured and four distinct failure modes were identified through analyzing damage images and micrographs. It is noted that the specific energy absorption (SEA) capability increases with impact velocity and can be affected significantly by the deformation of the hat-shaped shell, but appears to be less sensitive to the joining forms. Nonlinear finite element analyses based on selected progressive damage model were conducted to predict the failure and energy absorption characteristics of the T-joints under an impact loading. There exists a good correlation between the simulation and experimental results, which validates the present numerical modeling method. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

However, because their guts are generally removed before consumption, exposure may be low compared to other routes such as shellfish, drinking water and dust. Still, microplastics have been found to translocate from the gut to other tissues, making exposure from eating fish fillets or other seafood products a potential concern. To better understand fish as an exposure route for microplastics in humans, we tested hypotheses about whether translocation occurs and if efficiency of translocation is dependent on particle size. We investigated the amount and distribution of fluorescent polyethylene microspheres (10-300 ??m) in the gut, liver, fillets and gonads of adult rainbow trout after a two-week dietary exposure. Fish were fed food pellets dosed with up to 9,800 microspheres per gram of food. Total exposures over the entire experiment ranged from 80,000-850,000 microspheres per fish. We did not find any particles in the fillets, liver, or gonads of any fish, suggesting that translocation of spherical microplastics of this size range does not occur in adult rainbow trout. The quantity of microplastics found in the gut was also low or absent after a 24-hour depuration period, indicating effective excretion in this laboratory population. This research suggests that the consumption of fish fillets may not be a significant exposure pathway for microspheres >10 ??m in size to contaminate humans. Future studies should test for different sizes, morphologies and species to further our understanding. Copyright: ?? 2020 Kim et al.

Beach AL is likely moved together with coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM, algae, leaves), but no previous studies have assessed AL and CPOM co-distribution. We measured AL and CPOM on four urban beaches in Chicago, Illinois, USA, along two transect types (pier-adjacent, non-pier adjacent) in which each has three habitats (upland, beach, strand line). As expected, AL and CPOM density were positively related across all transects. AL and CPOM were significantly higher adjacent to piers, and variable among habitats. Wood, leaves, and smoking-related AL were most abundant in beach and upland zones while glass and algal detritus were abundant at the strandline. Overall, AL and CPOM show ?€?patchy?€? distribution attributed to wind and wave movement toward accumulation sites. Beach CPOM is a hot spot of biological activity (e.g., microbes, invertebrates, birds). Therefore, mixing of AL and CPOM suggests organisms may be more likely to encounter AL in mixed accumulations.

This work compared the effectiveness of different storage technologies for minimizing losses in smallholder conditions in 109 different locations from 21 to 2816 m above sea level (asl) across different agroecological zones of Mexico, under ?€?controlled?€? (i.e. managed by researchers), and ?€?non-controlled?€? conditions (i.e. on-farm managed by extension agents). Depending on the common practice at each site, conventional storage technologies (polypropylene bag with and/or without insecticide) were compared to alternative storage technologies (selected from hermetic metal silos, hermetic bags, recycled plastic containers, silage plastic bags, and inert dusts-micronized and standard lime) during one to 12 months. Data on grain damages were collected at the beginning and end of the storage period. Climatic variables and initial grain infestation with pests influenced the ability of a technology to minimize losses, particularly under tropical conditions. After six months of storage, percentages of insect-damaged grain with polypropylene bags, the most common farmers?€? practice, were 39.4% and 4.1%, respectively, in lowlands (<500 m asl) and highlands (>2000 m asl). With hermetic metal silos, percentages of insect-damaged grain after six months of storage were 3.8% on average in the highlands and similar in lowlands, with 2.9%. Hermetic technologies, which prevent the introduction of oxygen, were effective in reducing losses under farmers?€? conditions across agroecological areas, regardless of storage time. Recycled hermetic containers had similar results and were a viable low-cost alternative to more expensive options like hermetic metal silos. With adequate technical support for their appropriate use, hermetic technologies have the potential to reduce grain losses during storage and strengthen food security in Mexico and Latin American countries with similar conditions. ?? 2020 The Authors",
Q9XGGFHA,10.1016/j.porgcoat.2020.105726,TiO2 reinforced high-performance epoxy-co-polyamide composite coatings,"Epoxy-based protective coatings for outdoor and marine applications are commonly used to protect metals and alloys, and architectural elements against the environmental impact. An epoxy-co-polyamide (EP-PA) polymer is synthesized by reacting pre-polymers: epoxy and polyamide resins. TiO2 nanoparticles of different sizes are embedded into EP-PA copolymer to form composite coatings on the Teflon substrate, referred to as EP-PA/TiO2. TiO2 content is varied from 0.1 to 1.0 wt.% and the electrical, thermal, and mechanical performance of composites is analyzed. Both EP-PA polymer and EP-PA/TiO2 composite coatings are characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and electron microscopy. EP-PA/TiO2 composites exhibit a uniform distribution of individual TiO2 nanoparticles in the EP-PA matrix at low TiO2 content, while some aggregates are observed at the higher TiO2 content. The size effect of TiO2 nanoparticles is also demonstrated by clear differences in the surface topography, size distribution, extent of agglomeration, and surface roughness of the EP-PA/TiO2 composites. TiO2 nanoparticles have lower surface energy and therefore, increase the hydrophobic character of the composite coatings that is revealed by the increasing water droplet contact angle. The surface resistivity of EP-PA/TiO2 composites decreased with the increasing TiO2 content, while thermal degradation temperatures are improved by 100 K (15.7 %) compared to neat EP-PA polymer. The mechanical properties such as yield strength and Young's modulus are also enhanced by 56.9 % and 32.7 %, respectively at 1.0 wt.% TiO2 loading, while the toughness of EP-PA/TiO2 composites is comparable to the neat polymer. The remarkable enhancement in the hydrophobic character, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical performance of EP-PA/TiO2 composites at low TiO2 content (1.0 wt.%) is achieved by the small size, high surface area, and excellent dispersion of nanoparticles in the polymeric matrix. The simultaneous improvement in properties suggests EP-PA/TiO2 composites useful as protective coatings for a variety of applications in the harsh environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

With rope minimum break loads (MBL) comparable to that of their steel wire counterparts, the use of high modulus polyethylene (HMPE) ropes is seen as a viable option for use in subsea construction cranes. The ropes are worn out during use and visual inspection remains one of the main methods of determining whether a fibre rope is to be retired from use, therefore a natural extension is condition monitoring through computer vision. Creep and temperature are constraining with HMPE ropes and should be monitored continuously, particularly when the rope is cyclically bent over sheaves. Additionally, interpreting the thermal history of the rope during use could give insight into deterioration. In this paper, a condition monitoring system based on combined computer vision and thermal monitoring is used during cyclic bend over sheave tests performed on 560 kN break load of 12 strand braided HMPE ropes. New monitoring features such as local length and width through computer vision algorithms combined with surface thermal monitoring and global elongation are presented and their effectiveness as condition monitoring features is assessed. ?? 2020 The Authors",
8MJHZPUR,10.2478/sgem-2019-0050,The influence of the soil constitutive models on the seismic analysis of pile-supported wharf structures with batter piles in cut-slope rock dike,"In coastal regions, earthquakes caused severe damage to marine structures. Many researchers have conducted numerical investigations in order to understand the dynamic behavior of these structures. The most frequently used model in numerical calculations of soil is the linear-elastic perfectly plastic model with a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion (MC model). It is recommended to use this model to represent a first-order approximation of soil behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to accommodate soil constitutive models for the specific geotechnical problems. In this paper, three soil constitutive models with different accuracy were applied by using the two-dimensional finite element software PLAXIS to study the behavior of pile-supported wharf embedded in rock dike, under the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. These models are: a linear-elastic perfectly plastic model (MC model), an elastoplastic model with isotropic hardening (HS model), and the Hardening Soil model with an extension to the small-strain stiffness (HSS model). A typical pile-supported wharf structure with batter piles from the western United States ports was selected to perform the study. The wharf included cut-slope (sliver) rock dike configuration, which is constituted by a thin layer of rockfill overlaid by a slope of loose sand. The foundation soil and the backfill soil behind the wharf were all dense sand. The soil parameters used in the study were calibrated in numerical soil element tests (Oedometer and Triaxial tests). The wharf displacement and pore pressure results obtained using models with different accuracy were compared to the numerical results of Heidary-Torkamani et al.[28] It was found that the Hardening Soil model with small-strain stiffness (HSS model) gives clearly better results than the MC and HS models. Afterwards, the pile displacements in sloping rockfill were analyzed. The displacement time histories of the rock dike at the top and at the toe were also exposed. It can be noted that during the earthquake there was a significant lateral ground displacement at the upper part of the embankment due to the liquefaction of loose sand. This movement caused displacement at the dike top greater than its displacement at the toe.

BXKKRRIB,10.3390/app10175852,A new generation of bio-composite thermoplastic filaments for a more sustainable design of parts manufactured by FDM,"The most recent developments of Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) techniques are moving the application of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies toward new areas of investigation such as the biomedical, aerospace, and marine engineering in addition to the more consolidated industrial and civil fields. Some specific characteristics are required for the components designed for peculiar applications, such as complex geometries, lightweight, and high strength as well as breathability and aesthetic appearance specifically in the biomedical field. All these design specifications could be potentially satisfied by manufacturing with 3D printing techniques. Moreover, the development of purpose-dedicated filaments can be considered a key factor to successfully meet all the requirements. In this paper, fabrication and applications of five new thermoplastic materials with fillers are described and analyzed. They are organic bio-plastic compounds made of polylactic acid (PLA) and organic by-products. The growing interest in these new composite materials reinforced with organic by-products is due to the reduction of production management costs and their low environmental impact. In this study, the production workflow has been set up and described in detail. The main properties of these new thermoplastic materials have been analyzed with a major emphasis on strength, lightweight, and surface finish. The analysis showed that these materials can be particularly suitable for biomedical applications. Therefore, two different biomedical devices were selected and relative prototypes were manufactured with one of the analyzed thermoplastic materials. The feasibility, benefits, and performance of the thermoplastic material considered for these applications were successfully assessed. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

In this article, we successfully fabricated a novel heat-triggered shape-memory polymer (HSMP) based on ethylene?€?vinyl acetate copolymer/nitrile?€?butadiene rubber (EVA/NBR) thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) via dynamic vulcanization. The influence of deformation temperature (Td), recovery temperature (Tr), and recovery time on the shape-memory behavior of the EVA/NBR (weight ratio = 80/20) TPV was investigated systematically. The shape-memory result of the EVA/NBR (weight ratio = 80/20) TPV demonstrated that when the Td was close to the melting temperature (Tm) of the EVA phase (76??C), the TPV could obtain a good shape fixity ratio (&gt;95%) and an excellent shape recovery ratio (&gt;95%) at 100% stretch ratio. A shape-memory mechanism was proposed for this HSMP. The dynamic mechanical analysis results under temperature sweep mode showed that with increasing EVA content in TPVs, the tan ?? decreased, while the storage modulus increased. The morphology observation showed that the cross-linked NBR particles were dispersed evenly in the etched surface of EVA/NBR TPV with an average diameter of approximately 2?€?6 ??m. The longitudinal stretching surface of the EVA/NBR TPV exhibited the banding-like texture microstructure during the stretching process. ?? The Author(s) 2019.",

Samples were transported to the lab at the University of Alexandria, Egypt. This study aims to describe the embryogenesis of C. ramosus inside the capsules and test the effects of signaling factors and neuro-transmitters on the in vitro transformation of larvae of D. platypus and identify some bioactive inducers that increase larval metamorphosis. Capsules of C. ramosus were fixed in 10% saline formaldehyde and capsules of D. platypus were placed in plastic aquaria for immune-histochemical test. The sequence of the embryonic transformations and the duration time of each step of C. ramosus were identified. The importance of the following experiment is to provide a suitable medium for the developing larval stages and improve eugenic manner of the new generations.

The modeling of ice material is critical and difficult point to study the ice-structure interaction. This paper proposes a new ice material model based on a soil and concrete material model (MAT 78) with some user-defined ice material curves applied, to simulate the ice mechanical behavior in an ice-plate impact scenario. Calibration of the proposed ice material model is performed by comparing the pressure-area relationship recommended by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) rules. Using this proposed ice model, numerical simulations are conducted to study the dynamic behavior of plates under ice impact by using LS-DYNA finite element program. The related model tests were also performed to verify the accuracy of the results calculated by numerical method. Besides, a series of numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the influences of initial ice impact kinetic energy and ice impact momentum on ice-plate impact. The maximum plastic deformations of plate, energy absorption of plate and energy dissipation of ice damage during the ice impact process are studied in these numerical simulations. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
3ZWYR9QB,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139065,Rainfall is a significant environmental factor of microplastic pollution in inland waters,"Worldwide, increasing attention is being paid to the issue of microplastic pollution in marine ecosystems, yet there is a relative lack of knowledge concerning the pollution of microplastic in inland water systems, although these microplastics are major sources of ocean pollution. In aquatic environments, previous efforts have mainly been devoted to exploring the impact of human-related activities on microplastic pollution, but little is known about non-anthropogenic effects on microplastic distribution. In this paper, the relationship between rainfall and the microplastic concentration of surface water was studied for the first time. The investigation was conducted in Lake Donghu (the largest urban lake in China) from July 23 to September 1, 2019. The abundance of microplastics in the lake water ranged from 7.4 to 29.6 items/L. The dominant size of the collected microplastics was less than 2 mm, with a dominant fiber shape and a dominant transparent color. Our results demonstrated that microplastic concentration was significantly related to rainfall. Therefore, high frequency sampling and rainfall data are needed to accurately evaluate microplastic pollution as well as its consequences. ?? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

Due to the persistent nature of plastics in the environment, their buoyancy characteristics, degradation dynamics, and ability to mimic the behavior of natural prey, there exists significant opportunity for marine organisms to ingest these man-made materials. In this study we examined gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of 42 post-hatchling loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtles stranded in Northeast Florida. Necropsies revealed abundant numbers of plastic fragments ranging from 0.36 to 12.39 mm in size (length), recovered from the GI tracts of 39 of the 42 animals (92.86%), with GI burdens ranging from 0 to 287 fragments with a mass of up to 0.33 g per turtle. Post-hatchlings weighed from 16.0 to 47.59 g yielding a plastic to body weight percentage of up to 1.23%. Several types of plastic fragments were isolated, but hard fragments and sheet plastic were the most common type, while the dominant frequency of fragment color was white. Fragment size and abundance mixed with natural gut contents suggests significant negative health consequences from ingestion in animals at this life stage. Gaining greater insight into the prevalence of plastic ingestion, the types of plastic and the physiological effects of plastic consumption by multiple life-stages of sea turtles will aid the prioritization of mitigation efforts for the growing marine debris problem. This report demonstrates that plastic ingestion is a critical issue for marine turtles from the earliest stages of life. ??

JE6J93C4,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138893,The microplastic profile of an urban African stream,"Microplastics are small plastic fragments that have been found around the world, however, research into microplastics in Africa and freshwater systems remains insufficient. In this study, the snapshot microplastic profile of an urban stream was assessed in the Braamfontein Spruit, located in Johannesburg the largest city in South Africa. The abundance of microplastics was determined in water, Chironomus sp. larvae and sediment, while in situ parameters were taken to investigate their relationship to the microplastic profile of the different matrices. Microplastics were detected in water (mean of 705 particles m??3), Chironomus sp. larvae (mean of 53.4 particles g??1 wet weight) and sediment (mean of 166.8 particles kg??1 dry weight). The study found evidence of how urban stream characteristics such as a weir, stream depth and velocity could affect the abundance and dispersion of microplastics. The results indicate that areas of increased depth and decreased flow allowed microplastics to settle down to the sediment where benthic macroinvertebrates could ingest these fragments. Large obstructions like a weir also increased microplastic counts in sediment and invertebrates above the obstruction, with a decrease of fragments after the obstruction, however, microplastics in surface water were able to flow over the obstruction and increase in abundance downstream. This study concludes that first order urban streams such as the Braamfontein Spruit may be contributing large numbers of microplastics to higher order streams and large rivers in times of increased flow. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Procellariiform seabirds retain oily components of their prey in theirs stomach as a means to store energy. A marine litter-derived microplastic reference mixture and separately a marine litter-derived polystyrene sample were added to stomach oils in an experiment. A total of 15 additives, including plasticizers, antioxidants, UV stabilizers, flame retardants, and preservatives, were identified in the original plastic mixtures and monitored in the leachates. These substances include those known for endocrine disruptive, carcinogenic, and/or other negative effects on organisms. Stomach oil was exposed to these plastic materials and was sampled during a long-term experiment (0, 14, and 90 days?€? exposure of plastic particles in stomach oil) and a subsequent short-term detailed study (8 h and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 21 days). Five of the monitored substances were shown to strongly leach from the microplastic reference mixture into the stomach oil during the experiment. Four substances were identified in a marine litter-derived polystyrene foam, of which two leached into stomach oil. Leaching of harmful plastic additives to the stomach oil of fulmars may be of concern, as fulmars regularly ingest plastics that are retained and gradually ground in the gizzard before passage to the intestines and excretion. ??

However the repeatable quality of the product can be achieved by critically fixing the process parameters such as Vacuum Pressure (VP) and permeability of the preform. The present investigation is aimed at studying the effect of permeability for production of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polyester (GFRP) components with consistent quality. The VARTM mould is made with an acrylic transparent top cover to observe and record the resin flow pattern. Six layers of randomly placed glass fiber under five different vacuum pressures VP1 = 0.013, VP2 = 0.026, VP3 = 0.039, VP4 = 0.053 and VP5 = 0.066 MPa were studied. The laminates produced by this process under the above mentioned conditions were characterized with ASTM D procedures so as to study the effect of these process parameters on the quality of the laminate. And as mentioned there is a considerable effect of permeability on the impact strength and the void content in the laminates under different vacuum pressures.

78RJCCSC,10.1021/acs.est.0c02273,Global Riverine Plastic Outflows,"Global marine plastic pollution, which is derived mainly from the input of vast amounts of land-based plastic waste, has drawn increasing public attention. Riverine plastic outflows estimated using models based on the concept of mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) are substantially greater than reported field measurements. Herein, we formulate a robust model using the Human Development Index (HDI) as the main predictor, and the modeled riverine plastic outflows are calibrated and validated by available field data. A strong correlation is achieved between model estimates and field measurements, with a regression coefficient of r2 = 0.9. The model estimates that the global plastic outflows from 1518 main rivers were in the range of 57,000-265,000 (median: 134,000) MT year-1 in 2018, which were approximately one-tenth of the estimates by MPW-based models. With increased plastic production and human development, the global riverine plastic outflow is projected to peak in 2028 in a modeled trajectory of 2010-2050. The HDI is a better indicator than MPW to estimate global riverine plastic outflows, and plastic pollution can be effectively assessed and contained during human development processes. The much lower global riverine plastic outflows should substantially ease the public's concern about marine plastic pollution and financial pressure for remediation.

A total of 30 samples with sizes of 5 cm x 5 cm x 30 cm prepared. All samples were arranged using a plastic strap and immersed at a depth of 3 m in the sea for 3 months. At the end of the bioassay, the biological performance of the wood samples was analyzed by obtaining the attack intensity and weight loss of the samples. The results showed that all the samples were attacked by marine borer in various intensity, thereby leading to various weight loss. D. indica showed the lowest attack intensity and weight loss compared to the other species. On the contrary, A. falcataria (L) Fosberg showed the highest attack intensity and weight loss. Therefore, in conclusion, D. indica and A. falcataria (L) Fosberg has the highest and lowest natural resistance against marine borer attack, compared to the other wood species.

A total of 150 sediment samples were collected using a 0.5 ?? 0.5 ?? 0.2 m quadrant placed along designated high, drift and current waterlines at five (5) beaches. Analysis for 6 PAEs-sorbed to microplastics (MPs) was carried out using gas chromatography ?€? mass spectrometry (GC?€?MS). Microplastic particles (1?€?5 mm) were identified visually and FTIR spectroscopy was also used for identification. The MPs distribution was variably heterogenous with a total of 3424 particles per m2 found within the drift and high waterlines across all sites. Results indicated fragments as the dominant microplastic type compared to pellets and fibres. Polyethylene terephthalate was the major polymer type and accounted for a weighted average of 41% of the total plastics, followed by polystyrene (28%), and polypropylene (21%). The ???6PAEs concentration ranged from BDL to 164.09 mg/kg dw, dominated by di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DnBP), and dimethyl phthalate. The preliminary ecological risk assessment of PAEs in the microplastic fraction, RQmp, showed DEHP and DnBP may present medium to high biological risks to marine organisms, suggesting that future study of PAEs in total sediment versus the MP fraction might be useful to refine ecological risk assessments. Land-based anthropogenic activities are primary sources of MPs, whereas oceanographic peculiarities of the area constitute the major distribution driving force. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Part I: Experimental study,"Due to the extraordinary corrosion resistance of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP), the use of seawater sea-sand concrete (SSC) combined with FRP materials becomes highly attractive in the constructions of coastal and marine infrastructures. To this end, a total of 40 CFRP confined seawater sea-sand concrete cylinders are constructed and tested under axial compressive load in this study. The main variables of the test include the concrete type, CFRP strengthening schemes and the number of CFRP layers. The failure modes, axial stress-strain curves, lateral strain-axial strain relationships and CFRP hoop strain distributions of the specimens are analyzed systematically. It can be detected from the test results that both unconfined and CFRP confined SSC exhibited similar mechanical properties compared with the corresponding specimens cast with normal concrete. Moreover, the clear spacing ratio and the confinement stiffness of CFRP were found to be the two most important factors in accounting for the axial compressive behaviors and the dilation properties. Finally, a new stress-strain model proposed in this paper and several existing models were used to predict the ultimate conditions of CFRP partially wrapped columns in this test. The accuracy and reliability of each model were verified and discussed by comparing the test observations and theoretical predictions. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Here we reported a superhydrophobic coated-mesh, where the coatings were composed of fluorinated silica (F-SiO2) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), demonstrating the excellent oil-water separation ability towards various organic liquids. The introduction of F-SiO2 could well induce a certain extent of microscopic roughness, leading to the remarkable water repellence. The resultant coatings exhibited the robust superhydrophobicity with the water contact angle reaching 155.9????1.0??. On this basis, the pore size of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) mesh materials (as a substrate) was mainly discussed with the great oil-water separation efficiency of as high as 98% towards various organic liquids. Also, under the assistance of physical model, it was confirmed that there was a mechanical relation between pore size and organic liquids, where the main connotation was the matching issue of surface tension of organic liquids with the geometrical mechanic (induced by the pore size of the superhydrophobic coated-mesh). This work on the size effect of superhydrophobic coated-mesh materials on various organic liquids is beneficial to the design and manufacture of ideal oil-water separation materials. ?? 2020",

These readily-defined magnetic nanocomposites were constructed through co-assembly of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONs) and a degradable amphiphilic polymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-dopamine-functionalized poly(ethyl propargyl glucose carbonate)-b-poly(ethyl glucose carbonate), PEG-b-PGC[(EPC-MPA)-co-(EPC-DOPA)]-b-PGC(EC), driven by supramolecular co-assembly in water with enhanced interactions provided via complexation between dopamine and MIONs. The composite nanoscopic assemblies possessed a pseudo-micellar structure, with MIONs trapped within the polymer framework. The triblock terpolymer was synthesized by sequential ring-opening polymerizations (ROPs) of two glucose-derived carbonate monomers, initiated by a PEG macroinitiator. Dopamine anchoring groups were subsequently installed by first introducing carboxylic acid groups using a thiol-yne click reaction, followed by amidation with dopamine. The resulting amphiphilic triblock terpolymers and MIONs were co-assembled to afford hybrid nanocomposites using solvent exchange processes from organic solvent to water. In combination with hydrophobic interactions, the linkage between dopamine and iron oxide stabilized the overall nanoscopic structure to allow for the establishment of a uniform globular morphology, whereas attempts at co-assembly with the triblock terpolymer precursor, lacking dopamine side chains, failed to afford well-defined nanostructures. The magnetic hybrid nanoparticles demonstrated high oil sorption capacities, ca. 8 times their initial dry weight, attributed, in part, to large surface areas leading to effective contact between the nanomaterials and hydrocarbon pollutants. Moreover, the naturally-derived polymer framework undergoes hydrolytic degradation to break down into byproducts that include glucose, ethanol and dopamine if not recovered after deployment, alleviating concerns of potential microplastic generation and persistence.

N9MTM6QJ,10.1242/jeb.228544,Adhesive plasticity among populations of purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus),"Sea urchins native to the nearshore open coast experience periods of high, repeated wave forces that can result in dislodgement. To remain attached while clinging and locomoting across rocky substrates, sea urchins use adhesive tube feet. Purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) adhere to a variety of rock substrates (e.g. sandstone, mudstone, granite), and display morphological plasticity (skeletal morphology) to native substrate. We tested the hypothesis that their adhesive system is also plastic and varies as a function of native population and substrate. The results of our study support our hypothesis. Sea urchins from sandstone adhere less strongly to most substrates than those native to mudstone and granite rock. Sandstone produced the lowest whole animal adhesive force values across all populations, suggesting that this rock type is particularly challenging for sea urchins to adhere to. The number of adhesive tube feet that failed during experimental trials and the area used by sea urchins to attach, matches closely with whole animal adhesive force values: higher forces resulted in more tube foot failure and larger attachment area. On artificial substrates (glass and Plexiglass), differences in adhesion among populations was consistent with differences in adhesion on rock substrates except on glass, where sea urchins native to sandstone adhered more strongly to glass than any other substrate tested. To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe population-level plasticity in a biological adhesive system related to native substrate, and has significant implications for sea urchin ecology, behavior and functional morphology. ?? 2020.

Reliable information on the origin, fate and pathways of plastic in river systems is required to optimize prevention, mitigation and reduction strategies. Yet, accurate and long-term data on plastic transport are still lacking. Current macroplastic monitoring strategies involve labor intensive sampling methods, require investment in infrastructure, and are therefore infrequent. Crowd-based observations of riverine macroplastic pollution may potentially provide frequent cost-effective data collection over a large geographical range. We extended the CrowdWater citizen science app for hydrological observations with a module for observations of plastic in rivers. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of crowd-based observations of floating macroplastic and macroplastic on riverbanks. We analyzed data from two case studies: (1) floating plastic measured in the Klang (Malaysia), and (2) plastic on riverbanks along the Rhine (the Netherlands). Crowd-based observations of floating plastic in the Klang yield similar estimates of plastic transport (2,000?€?3,000 items h???1), cross-sectional distribution (3?€?7 percent point difference) and polymer categories (0?€?6 percent point difference) as reference observations. It also highlighted the high temporal variation in riverine plastic transport. The riverbank observations provided the first data of macroplastic pollution on the most downstream stretch of the Rhine, revealing peaks close to urban areas and an increasing plastic density toward the river mouth. The mean riverbank density estimates are also similar for the crowd-based and reference methods (573?€?1,033 items km???1). These results highlight the value of including crowd-based riverine macroplastic observations in future monitoring strategies. Crowd-based observations may provide reliable estimations of plastic transport, density, spatiotemporal variation and composition for a larger number of locations than conventional methods. ??

Microplastics were separated by flotation. Microplastic characteristics were investigated and analyzed by Nile red staining and Fourier infrared spectrometer. The results showed that there was slight microplastic pollution in the coastal plain. 92.9% of the detected microplastics were granular, 6.1% were fibers, and only 1.0% were films. Microplastics with a particle size of 20-100 ??m accounted for 57.9% of the total, particles with the size of 100-1000 ??m accounted for 38.6%, and particles with the size of 1000-5000 ??m accounted for 3.5%. The presence of film-like PE was detected, indicating that microplastic contamination in the soil was likely to come from the utilization and mulching of agricultural mulch. The amount of microplastics in soil was related to the size of microplastics. Abundance of microplastics in soil increased with decreasing of the size of soil.

Estuary is an important pathway for land microplastics to enter into the oceans by rivers. In this study, we hypothesized that microplastics would sink into estuary sediment during diffusion and transmission from river before entering into the sea, which results in higher accumulation of microplastics in proximity to river-estuary than in the oceans. In order to demonstrate this hypothesis, sediment samples were collected from an estuary and its two main inputting rivers and the microplastics in these samples were analyzed. In the collected sediment samples, 19 types of polymers, including the three most common polymers (polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and poly(propylene:ethylene)), were identified and confirmed by FT-IR. Eight types of polymers were consistently detected in all samples, while 11 types of polymers were occasionally found in some samples. These microplastics exhibited four shapes and their percentages followed the high-to-low order of film, fragment, fiber and pellet. A relatively lower abundance of microplastics was found in river sediments from Shuangtaizi River with an average of 170 ?? 96 particles/kg d.w., compared to that from Daliao River with an average of 237 ?? 129 particles/kg d.w., but it was higher than that from Liaohe Estuary with an average of 120 ?? 46 particles/kg d.w. Furthermore, the highest concentration of microplastics was found at the mouth of rivers, showing high accumulation where the freshwater and saltwater meet. Results from this study, including the abundance, characteristics and spatial distribution of microplastic pollution in sediments from an interconnected river-estuary system, revealed the fate and distribution of microplastics in the river and estuary environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
KMUKLUWC,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139083,Weathering alters surface characteristic of TiO2-pigmented microplastics and particle size distribution of TiO2 released into water,"In natural environment, microplastics (MPs) undergo varying degrees of aging. It is believed that aged MPs show different surface properties and leaching behaviors from unaged ones. Here, the effects of aging on surface characteristics of TiO2-pigmented MPs and particle size distribution of TiO2 leached from MPs were systematically investigated. Experimental results show that the carbonyl index and color difference of MPs increased after aging. The increased carbonyl content in MPs was due to photo-oxidation, which further caused the fragility of MPs, the loss of TiO2 pigments and the formation of surface cracks. The decreased weight loss for aged MPs was due to the photo-transformation of LDPE into other compounds. Aged MPs could release more and faster TiO2 particles than unaged MPs, and aged MPs tended to release more large particles (&gt;5 ??m) and fewer small particles (&lt;5 ??m) than unaged MPs. Aged MPs released TiO2 with particle size uniformly distributed in each size fraction, but unaged MPs mainly released small particles (57.6%?€?86.2%). With increasing leaching time, the proportion of small particles leached from MPs especially aged MPs decreased and the proportion of large particles increased. These findings will help us better understand how aging process impacts the properties and leaching of MPs and the size distribution of particulate additives leached from MPs. ?? 2020",

Due to their large surface to volume ratio and chemical surface properties, MPs adsorb hazardous chemicals from their surrounding environment. When MPs are consumed by fauna, they transfer those substances through the trophic chain. An essential issue of MPs is their disposal. Due to their size, the disposal methods commonly used for plastic items are not suited for MPs. Here, photocatalysis in an aqueous medium is proposed as an alternative to fight MPs pollution. Although the photocatalysis of MPs has been reported, the effect of operating variables in the process has not been investigated. To fill this gap, the impact of pH and temperature on the degradation process of HDPE MPs was investigated using C,N-TiO2 and visible light. Degradation was followed by mass loss, carbonyl index calculation and microscopy. It was found that photocatalysis at low temperature (0 ??C) increases MPs?€? surface area by fragmentation, and low pH value (pH 3) favours hydroperoxide formation during photooxidation. By using the design of experiments tool, it was demonstrated that there is a combined effect of pH and temperature in the photocatalysis of HDPE MPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

However, the impact of cigarette butts known to contain toxic chemicals has been investigated to date in very few marine species. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of cigarette filters (smoked or unsmoked) on the microbial diversity inhabiting coastal sediments by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. Both bacterial structure and metals distribution were impacted by cigarette filter addition in laboratory sediment experiments, compared to control sediment incubations without filter. Both smoked and unsmoked cigarette filters decreased pH and dissolved Cd, Mo and V concentrations in marine sediment incubations, while they increased dissolved Fe, Mn, Zn levels in the surrounding environment. Smoked filters dramatically decreased the relative abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria, while the members of the phyla Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Thermotogae were enriched by smoked filters in marine sediments. Bacterial taxa associated with deep marine environments or hydrothermal seep fields were selected by smoked cigarette filters. This study demonstrated for the first time the microbial community changes and impacts from toxic cigarette filters in coastal marine sediments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The aims of this study were to go beyond visual identification techniques and develop and apply a simple seafood sample cleanup, extraction, and quantitative analysis method using pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry to improve the detection of plastic contamination. This method allows the identification and quantification of polystyrene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, and poly(methyl methacrylate) in the edible portion of five different seafood organisms: Oysters, prawns, squid, crabs, and sardines. Polyvinyl chloride was detected in all samples and polyethylene at the highest total concentration of between 0.04 and 2.4 mg g-1 of tissue. Sardines contained the highest total plastic mass concentration (0.3 mg g-1 tissue) and squid the lowest (0.04 mg g-1 tissue). Our findings show that the total concentration of plastics is highly variable among species and that microplastic concentration differs between organisms of the same species. The sources of microplastic exposure, such as packaging and handling with consequent transference and adherence to the tissues, are discussed. This method is a major development in the standardization of plastic quantification techniques used in seafood. Copyright ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

To Investigate the MPs accumulation In wild and cultured mussels, a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model was developed and validated with the available field data of Mytilus edulis (M. edulis, wild) from the North Sea and Mytilus galloprovincialis (M. galloprovincialis, cultured) from the northern Ionian Sea. Towards a generic DEB model, the site-specific model parameter, half-saturation coefficient (Xk), was applied as a power function of food density for the cultured mussel, while for the wild mussel It was calibrated to a constant value. The DEBaccumulation model simulated the uptake and excretion rate of MPs, taking Into account environmental characteristics (temperature and chlorophyll a). An accumulation of MPs equal to 0.53 particles per Individual (fresh tissue mass 1.9 g) and 0.91 particles per Individual (fresh tissue mass 3.3 g) was simulated for the wild and cultured mussel after 4 and 1 years respectively, In agreement with the field data. The Inverse experiments Investigating the depuration time of the wild and cultured mussel In a clean-from-MPs environment showed a 90% removal of MPs load after 2.5 and 12 d respectively. Furthermore, sensitivity tests on model parameters and forcing functions highlighted that besides MPs concentration, the accumulation Is highly dependent on temperature and chlorophyll a of the surrounding environment. For this reason, an empirical equation was found, directly relating the environmental concentration of MPs, with the seawater temperature, chlorophyll a, and the mussel's soft tissue MPs load. ??

Surveys of floating debris at sea show that this is not related to high densities of plastic in the area. Only 19 macroplastic items were observed during 905 km of at-sea transects (0.5 items??km???2; 135 g??km???2). This low density confirms previous microplastic surveys which show that the Pitcairn group lies west of the South Pacific Gyre. Plastic loads on beaches at other islands in the Pitcairn group are not exceptional. The east coast of Henderson Island appears to be particularly effective at accumulating drifting debris, but many small plastic fragments on these beaches probably result from degradation in situ, so removing macroplastics will reduce the formation of microplastics. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

This paper evaluates the potential of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for the analysis of microplastics and nanoplastics. The condition of different tests including the volume ratio of sample to silver colloid, the concentrations of NaCl, and the concentrations of the samples, are assessed for the study of microplastics and nanoplastics (polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP)) in pure water and seawater. A method based on SERS, that uses silver colloid as the active substrate, is developed for the qualitative analysis of microplastics and nanoplastics in aquatic environments. The particle sizes of microplastics and nanoplastics include 100 nm, 500 nm and 10 ??m. The Raman signals of microplastics and nanoplastics in pure water and seawater both show good enhancement efficiency. The optimal enhancement factor is 4 ?? 104. The SERS-based detection method overcomes the limitations of microplastics and nanoplastics in liquids and can detect 100 nm plastics down to 40 ??g/mL. It provides more possibility for the rapid detection of microplastics and nanoplastics in aquatic environments in the future. ?? 2020",

In this study, muscle samples of 30 bogues (Boops boops; Linneaus, 1758) from the North Western Mediterranean Sea were analysed to assess the concentrations of 19 organophosphate flame retardant (OPFR) compounds and to inspect any relationship with microplastic ingestion and relative levels of anthropization. Out of the 19 OPFRs analysed, 6 compounds were detected, being tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), 2-ethylhexyldiphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) and triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) the most abundant. As expected, OPFR concentrations were higher in samples collected off the most anthropized area of the city of Barcelona than in those from the Cap de Creus Marine Protected Area, while no significant correlation was detected between OPFR concentrations and microplastic ingestion. The results of this manuscript provide a first evidence of OPFR presence in the muscle of the bogue and identify the coastal area off Barcelona as a possible concentration area for contaminants, further supporting the use of the bogue as an indicator species of plastic pollution in the Mediterranean Sea. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

To date, there are still fundamental gaps in our understanding of the major pathways and fate of plastic debris in the oceans. Here we show that oceanic insular environments are important transitory repositories of small plastic items floating in the open ocean. Monthly monitoring of seven beaches over a three-year period demonstrate that beaches of the Azores islands with particular characteristics can capture significant quantities of fragments between 2 and 5 mm in length. The beach with the highest plastic loading rates was found to occasionally accumulate densities exceeding 15,000 fragments m???2 on part of the backshore. However, a large portion of these fragments can be rapidly washed back into the marine environment. Detailed characterization of those plastic items revealed the typology and size distribution to be similar throughout the seven beaches and through the 33 months surveyed, suggesting a same and unique source. Our results show that these oceanic islands of the North-East Atlantic are under pressure of high quantities of fragmented plastic debris that probably entered the ocean many years ago. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Monthly monitoring of plastic loading rates and accumulation on seven beaches of the Azores islands over a 33-month period revealed a chronic exposure to plastic pollution in these oceanic islands. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Pollution sources are key to understanding how microplastics travel from land to open oceans. Given that information regarding microplastic transport from diffuse sources is limiting, we conducted a study on roadside dust from rural and urban Victoria, Australia, over two seasons. Any deposited fugitive dust and particulate matter may also be present in our samples. The average microplastic abundance over two seasons ranged from 20.6 to 529.3 items/kg (dry weight based), with a predominant portion of fibers and items less than 1 mm. Polyester and polypropylene were the dominant polymer types (26%) while cotton and cellulose were the most common non-plastic items (27%). Sampling sites displayed consistent microplastic abundances over time and shared similar patterns in size, shape and polymer composition. Multiple correlation and principal component analysis suggest that urbanization and rainfall are important influences to roadside microplastic accumulation. The observed microplastic hotspots were generally located within close vicinity of areas where urban intensive land use and regional population sizes are high. Microplastics accumulated on roads and road verges during periods of dry weather and were flushed away during heavy storms while the corresponding trigger value was unknown. Monitoring roadside dust can be considered as an initial and cost-effective screening of microplastic pollution in urban areas. Further efforts should be made to optimize the methodologies and we advocate prolonged sampling schemes for roadside dust monitoring. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Urbanization and weather conditions are major factors to microplastic accumulation by roadsides. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

A preliminary study,"Several studies have shown the ubiquitousness of microplastics across ecosystems worldwide including significant amounts in beach sand. In Thailand, however, there is a lack of studies about the microplastic pollution of beaches. This study aimed to quantify microplastics at the high-tide line of 21 beaches along the eastern Gulf of Thailand. Observed amounts ranged from 420 to >200,000 counts/kg. Anthropogenic and environmental factors affect distribution and amount of microplastics. Tide-dominated beaches and beach sections protected by beachrocks exhibit higher microplastic amounts due to lesser hydrodynamics. While human activities have a visible impact, in some cases environmental factors seem to predominate.

Fish exploit almost every kind of marine environment, occupy many ecological niches and are an important food source for human populations worldwide. For these reasons, they seem to represent very appropriate biological indicators of microplastic ingestion. UNEP/MAP SPA/RAC (2018) identified the bogue, Boops boops (Linnaeus, 1758), as a possible target species for monitoring microplastic ingestion in fish populations. This study provides the first report of microplastic ingestion by B. boops from the Tyrrhenian and the Ligurian Seas (Western Mediterranean Sea). Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to analyse the relationship among biological parameters and environmental factors. A total of 379 bogues were collected in three Italian regions, subject to different anthropogenic pressures (river input, human population, shipping lanes and distance from the coast). Microplastics were detected in the gastrointestinal tract of most individuals (56%) with a mean of 1.8 (??0.2) microplastics per individual. Our study further confirms that this species is able to highlight differences in the ingestion of microplastics according to local anthropization, resulting Latium region to be the most polluted. Fish with lower physical condition are more likely to ingest microplastics, suggesting a relationship with the level of local environmental contamination. Finally, the ingestion of microplastics might be influenced by behavioural differences between sexes. According to our results, males ingest significantly more microplastics than females (p < 0.05).

Unexpectedly, no significant linear relationships were found between the levels of MPs in the organs of the snails and the levels in the sediment/tidal water. Further studies were done to explore the sources of the MPs in snail organs. MPs in snail organs at both the landward (interior) and seaward (exterior) zones mainly origin from the pore water. Moreover, the MPs found in the snails showed no relevance to the particulate matter (PM) collected from pore water.

A field-based assessment of anthropogenic macrolitter loads and emission rates of three German tributaries,"Research into the scope of litter pollution in freshwater systems has shown similar levels to the marine and coastal environment. Global model estimates of riverine emission rates of anthropogenic litter are largely based on microplastic studies as long-term and holistic observations of riverine macroplastics are still scarce. This study therefore aims to contribute a detailed assessment of macrolitter in the transitional waters of three major North Sea tributaries: Ems, Weser, and Elbe. Litter surveys were carried out in four river compartments: along the embankment, on the river surface, in the water column, and on the river bed. The data revealed spatio-temporal variability and distinct pollution levels for each compartment. Beaches had the highest debris diversity and were significantly more littered than vegetated sites and harbors. Stony embankments were least polluted. Benthic litter levels appeared substantial despite rapid burial of objects being likely due to high suspended sediment loads. Two extrapolation approaches were tested to scale daily and annual litter emission quantities of surface- and subsurface-floating litter. Using the mean (median) litter item mass from water column samples, total annual mass discharges were calculated: ???0.9 (0.2) t y???1 to ???2.8 (0.5) t y???1 emitted via the Ems, ???1.3 (0.2) t y???1 to ???12.0 (1.9) t y???1 through the Weser, and ???14.7 (2.4) t y???1 to ???801 (128) t y???1 carried into the North Sea by the Elbe. These rates deviate considerably from previous model estimates of plastic loads discharged by these three rivers. Future studies should therefore ground-truth model estimates with more river-specific and long-term field observations.

Although there has been extensive research on microplastics, the sorption behavior of PS NPs in surface waters remains unknown. In addition, in the previous joint toxicity studies, the concentration of organic pollutant in the joint system was based on the EC50 of this pollutant, rather than the actually amount of this pollutant adsorbed on nanoplastics (NPs). In this study, the sorption behavior of PS NPs with different surface charges in the surface water of estuaries and joint toxicity of that absorbed tetracycline antibiotic in equilibrium were investigated for the first time. Because of the electrostatic repulsion, salting-out effect, and partition function, the sorption capacity of tetracycline antibiotic by differently charged PS NPs was enhanced with increasing salinity. The biological effects of exposure to tetracycline-saturated PS NPs were complicated, which can be attributed to the surface characteristics of mixtures such as hydrophobicity and charges. Thus, the role of NPs in the natural environment as a carrier of antibiotics may provide an alternative for antibiotic inputs from inland water to coastal marine water, which would not only change the environmental fate and ecotoxicology of antibiotics and NPs, but also pose challenges to the safety of coastal aquaculture and marine ecosystem. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

A selection of appropriate bioindicator species for plastic ingestion has been proposed, mostly covering benthic filter-feeding organisms or large marine vertebrates. However, monitoring programs involving a broad range of synergetic bioindicators are still missing. Jellyfish have recently been reported as target organisms for marine litter, being able to internalise a number of anthropogenic fragments, from macro- to microplastics. With this perspective, we consider the trophic role of jellyfish and critically discuss its use as a novel bioindicator for plastic pollution on a global scale. Being a widespread energy source in pelagic and deep-sea food webs worldwide and occurring at high densities, jellyfish may represent the invertebrate bioindicator counterpart to monitor plastic pollution in pelagic waters, along with their common predators, and we recommend its inclusion in future monitoring surveys. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The purpose of this investigation is to determine levels of micro and mesoplastic (MP), in the 1?€?5000 ??m range, in commercially important species of finfish and shellfish. Additionally, to determine and compare the relative MP levels in edible versus non-edible tissues, and consider the wider implications in terms of human health concerns with a preliminary risk identification approach. For several fish species, samples taken from typically non-edible (gills, digestive system) and edible (muscle) flesh, and were analysed separately. Scallops, where all tissues are edible, were analysed whole. Significant differences were observed in the number of particles isolated from the finfish gills and digestive tissues relative to the control samples, but not in the edible flesh. For scallops, the abundance of particles in the Scottish samples did not vary significantly from the control, while the Patagonian scallops displayed significantly higher numbers of MPs. Characterisation of MPs by FTIR microscopy found that 16?€?60% (depending on species) were polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE) in origin. The risk identification results validate MPs as an emerging risk in the food chain and establish seafood as a vector for the exposure and uptake of MPs through the ingestion route for humans.

In the current study, a novel overhead stirring method using flocculators was assessed for maintaining polystyrene (PS) microbeads (??10.4 ??m; 1.05 g cm???3) in suspension in seawater during 24 h and then compared with static and rotational exposure setups. Under optimized conditions, the system was able to maintain 59% of the initial PS microbeads in suspension after 24 h, compared to 6% using a static system and 100% using a rotating plankton wheel. Our findings document for the first time that overhead stirring as well as other, commonly used exposure systems (static) are unable to maintain constant microplastic exposure conditions in laboratory setups whereas rotation is very effective. This suggests toxicological studies employing either static or overhead stirring systems may be greatly overestimating the true microplastic exposure conditions. ?? 2020 The Authors",

This study proposes a guideline for consistent quantification of microplastic distributions. It contains specific recommendations on how to quantify common microplastic particle parameters, such as size or shape. These recommendations are based on how reliably a parameter can be measured and its importance for inter-study comparability. Furthermore, our study proposes a multidimensional vector approach, where one vector contains the information for the microplastic distribution in one sample. In this way geometric and statistical means can be used to quantitatively compare different studies. In particular, in combination with our proposed quantification procedure, a meaningful comparison of microplastic distributions across different studies becomes possible. Ultimately, this allows comparable long-term and global scale assessments, as well as the development of modeling approaches. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
VSBFSLST,10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151395,Motion behavior and metabolic response to microplastic leachates in the benthic foraminifera Haynesina germanica,"Plastic is one of the major sources of pollution in modern oceans. When in seawater, toxic plasticizers (the additives incorporated in plastic polymers during manufacturing processes) typically diffuse and accumulate in sediments and in benthic and pelagic organisms' tissues. These plastic leachates affect survival, behavior and metabolism of various marine metazoans, but little effort was placed in studying their effect on protists. In this contribution we monitored the short-term effect of polypropylene (PP) leachates at both environmentally realistic and chronic concentrations on Haynesina germanica locomotion and metabolism. We found that PP leachates has no lethal nor effects on this species activity. Taken together, these results suggest that benthic foraminifera may be more resistant than marine metazoans to plasticizers pollutants. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Garbage patches in the world's oceans are well documented, but quantitative assessments of floating debris are still lacking in some major areas. The Mediterranean Sea is one such area, despite being one of the most plastic polluted environments. We used data from the first international basin-scale survey of the Mediterranean Sea to provide the first abundance estimate of floating mega-debris (>30 cm) and map their distribution over the entire Mediterranean Sea. We estimated the total number of floating mega-debris at 2.9 million items, taking into account imperfect detection. Items larger than 30 cm represent only one fourth of the complete load of anthropogenic debris (>2 cm) in the Mediterranean, which scales up the estimate to 11.5 million floating debris. The highest densities were observed in the central Mediterranean, and the lowest in the eastern basin. This acute marine pollution might threaten to disrupt entire ecosystems through its impact on marine fauna (entanglement, ingestion, contamination), eventually impacting the tourism industry and the well-being of Mediterranean populations. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

This study provides the occurrence of small MPs (???3 ??m) in the gastrointestinal tract and muscle of adult benthopelagic fish Serranus scriba (L.1758), caught along Tunisian coasts. MPs were extracted from selected tissues using a potassium hydroxide digestion method (KOH 10%) and then quantified, and their chemical structure was characterized through Raman microspectroscopy. The results highlighted that MPs were present in all samples. The average abundance of MPs per gram of fish tissue identified through successive filters of 3 ??m, 1.2 ??m, and 0.45 ??m differed significantly among the sites. The properties of the MPs extracted indicated that polyethylene-vinyl-acetate (PEVA: 33.45%), high density polyethylene (HD-PE: 17.33%), and fragments were the most abundant plastic types and shape found, respectively. Among those, most MPs were found at a size class of 3?€?1.2 ??m (???60%), especially in the muscle, suggesting a high transfer of MPs into the human diet. Our field work also aimed to explore the effects observed in the gastrointestinal tract with a battery of biomarkers assessing oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. The preliminary results of this study showed the existence of a link between small MPs, sites, and their associated urban activities and induced oxidative stress.

Only the highest MPF concentration decreased early larval survival. MPF did not affect the timing or rate of molting across MPF treatments. While all larval and post-larval stages accumulated MPF under the cephalothorax carapace, stage II larvae and stage IV post-larvae showed the highest and lowest accumulation, respectively. MPF ingestion increased with larval stage and with MPF concentration; under starvation conditions, stage I larvae only ingested them at low MPF concentrations. Oxygen consumption rates were lower only in later larval stages when exposed to high MPF concentrations. Combined, our results indicate that MPF interactions and effects on American lobster larvae are dependent on larval stage, MPF concentration, and presence of food. ?? 2020 The Authors",

2Y7ADEXB,10.1039/d0em00119h,The sorption behaviour of amine micropollutants on polyethylene microplastics-impact of aging and interactions with green seaweed,"Microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment. Due to still rising global production, the emission of polymers into the environment and the abundance of microplastics have increased accordingly. Due to the long mineralization processes of microplastics, distribution in all compartments can be found. The hydrophobic surfaces of the particles can sorb chemical pollutants, therefore providing a potential pathway to accumulation by organisms within the food web. However, little is known about how long-term aging and degradation processes of microplastics can affect the sorption behaviours of organic pollutants on the particles. In this study, important industrial additives of emerging environmental concern, such as hydrophobic aromatic amines, were studied in relation to their sorption behaviour on high-density polyethylene and low-density polyethylene microplastics. Diphenylamine (log POW (logarithmic octanol-water partition coefficient) = 3.5) showed strong sorption, carbamazepine (log POW = 2.5) showed moderate sorption, and aniline (log POW = 0.9) showed no detectable sorption behaviour. Artificially aged particles exposed to photochemical aging and long-term mechanical treatment in water were compared to pristine microplastics. While mechanically aged microplastics promoted the sorption of aromatic amines, photochemically aged particles showed a decrease in sorption capacity due to changed surface chemistry. Importantly, the sorption capacity increased with increasing salinity, leading to strong implications for ocean systems, as an elevated uptake of pollutants could occur under marine conditions. Moreover, our study demonstrates that the ecotoxicological effects of diphenylamine on the growth of the seaweed Ulva (sea lettuce, Chlorophyta) were reduced in the presence of microplastics. As the plastic particles withdrew enough contaminants from solution, even toxic levels of diphenylamine (c = 10-4 M) became tolerable for the algae. However, the pollutants initially sorbed on the microplastics can be released again at a later point in the ageing process, thus having delayed pollution potential. This journal is ??

Considering that increasing urbanization surrounding watersheds increases the sources of plastic pollution and that fish feeding behavior may influence the probability of ingestion of these particles, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ingestion of MP by fish of different feeding habits in urbanized and non-urbanized streams. The fish were captured in ten streams in Southern Brazil and the stomach contents of 294 individuals belonging to 13 species were analyzed. Individuals of ten species ingested MP of fiber type. From a generalized linear mixed model, we observed that the urbanized streams and the omnivorous habit showed a positive correlation with MP intake. Our results suggest that both types of streams present MP, but this pollutant is probably more prominent in heavily urbanized sites, which may represent important sources of MP for larger systems along the river basin. This evidences the importance of preserving riparian areas of small order streams as a means to reduce MP inputs into these ecosystems. ?? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

Ten different polymers were identified in the sampled mussels, with polypropylene-co-polyethylene being the most prevalent. Microplastic particles were detected in 71% of mussels with the greatest number of particles observed in a single mussel being seven. No significant difference in microplastic particles per mussel was observed among the different sites sampled. A significant positive relationship between particles per mussel and size of upstream catchment was observed, but a relationship between particles per mussel and percentage of urban land use was not observed. ?? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

This supports the hypothesis that microplastics disrupt coral host-symbiont signaling. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd We investigated physiological responses including calcification, photosynthesis and alterations to polar metabolites, in the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata exposed to different concentrations of polyethylene microplastics. Results showed that at high plastic concentrations (50 particles/mL nominal concentration) the photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II in the coral symbiont was affected after 4 weeks of exposure. Both moderate and high (5 and 50 particles/mL nominal) concentrations of microplastics caused subtle but significant alterations to metabolite profiles of coral, as determined by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Specifically, exposed corals were found to have increased levels of phosphorylated sugars and pyrimidine nucleobases that make up nucleotides, scyllo-inositol and a region containing overlapping proline and glutamate signals, compared to control animals. Together with the photo-physiological stress response observed and previously published literature, these findings support the hypothesis that microplastics disrupt host-symbiont signaling and that corals respond to this interference by increasing signaling and chemical support to the symbiotic zooxanthellae algae. These findings are also consistent with increased mucus production in corals exposed to microplastics described in previous studies. Considering the importance of coral reefs to marine ecosystems and their sensitivity to anthropogenic stressors, more research is needed to elucidate coral response mechanisms to microplastics under realistic exposure conditions. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The equilibrium sorption capacity of BDE-47 by virgin PS, aged PS with seawater soaking, aged PS with UV irradiation and aged PS with seawater soaking and UV irradiation was 6.16, 4.96, 3.53, and 3.75 ng/g, respectively. The decrease in sorption capacity was related to the increase of surface crystallinity and the appearance of surface oxygen-containing functional groups. The kinetic and isotherm models suggested that aging did not change the sorption mechanism of BDE-47 on PS microplastics. pH had negligible impacts on BDE-47 sorption by virgin and aged PS. Sorption capacity of BDE-47 on aged PS in water with high salinity was lower than that on virgin PS, and DOM has less effect on the sorption of BDE-47 on aged PS. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Our concern in this paper is with the environmental governance of marine plastic pollution that emanates from Thailand, the sixth biggest contributor globally. By zooming in on land-based polluters in Thailand, we highlight both the systemic nature of the marine plastic problem and the relative impunity with which drivers of transboundary environmental harm function at all levels of governance. Drawing from 19 interviews conducted with actors from the public, private and non-profit sectors, we examine three stages of the problem: production, consumption and waste management. We found that three major barriers prevent Thailand's government, private sector and citizens from engaging in the sort collective action needed to reduce marine plastic pollution. They are: (i) insufficient incentives to enact political change; (ii) scalar disconnects in waste management; and (iii) inadequate public and private sector ownership over plastic waste reduction. As the state alone cannot change corporate and consumer behaviour, we argue that multi-stakeholder efforts across organisational scales of governance and administrative boundaries are needed to address the barriers. ?? 2020 Victoria University of Wellington and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",

To assess the degree of MP contamination in the intertidal zone of China, the abundance, shape, particle size and composition of MPs in sediment were investigated in this study. Sediment samples were collected from 13 stations along the coast of China. The density separation method was employed to isolate MPs from sediment and the polymer types of the MPs were determined by Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy. Our study demonstrated that MP pollution was widespread in the 13 intertidal stations. The average abundance of MPs was 309 ?? 81 items/kg dry weight. Fiber accounted for 71.5% of the isolated MPs, and the particles of less than 500 ??m accounted for the highest proportion (35.0%). A total of 12 polymers were identified; the main types were rayon (RY), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE). The shape and chemical composition of the MPs from the intertidal sediments of South and North China were different. In South China, MP fragments were more extensive, and PP was a more important component. In contrast, the intertidal sediments of North China contained more MP fibers with the majority being RY, indicating that the major source of MPs in the intertidal zone of North China may be domestic sewage. Additionally, the abundance of MPs in the intertidal sediments of the Pearl River and Jiulong River estuaries was higher than at other sites. A Spearman's correlation analysis showed that there was no correlation between MP abundance and sediment grain size or organic matter content. Our study highlights the ubiquitous distribution of MPs in the sediment along the coast of China and provides valuable information for risk assessment and source control of MP pollution in China's intertidal zone. MP pollution level is relatively high in intertidal sediments of China with obviously different pollution characteristics between southern and northern areas. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Smaller plastics are more easily ingested, potentially exerting greater influences on organisms. In this study, the effects of polystyrene nanoplastics (NP) on the toxic effects, bioaccumulation, biodegradation and enantioselectivity of ibuprofen (IBU) in algae Chlorella pyrenoidosa were explored. The influences on the growth rate, chlorophyll a, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (MDA) were evaluated after 96 h of exposure to a combination of polystryene NP (1 mg L???1) and IBU (5?€?100 mg L???1). The results indicated that the inhibitory effect of IBU on C. pyrenoidosa growth was alleviated in the presence of NP. For instance, the 96 h-IC50 value for rac-IBU in the treatment lacking NP was 45.7 mg L???1, and the corresponding value in the treatment containing NP was 63.9 mg L???1. The co-exposure of NP led to a significant enhancement of T-AOC and slight reduction of ROS and MDA compared with the individual exposure (IBU) group, suggesting a decreased oxidative stress. In addition, treatment with NP led to a decreased bioaccumulation and accelerated biodegradation of IBU in C. pyrenoidosa and enhanced removal in the medium. The enantioselective toxicity, bioaccumulation and biodegradation of IBU were observed both in the absence and presence of NP. S-IBU exhibited a greater toxicity, and R-IBU was preferentially accumulated and degraded in C. pyrenoidosa. No interconversion of the two enantiomers occurred regardless of the presence of NP. This consequence implied that the influence of coexistent NP should be considered in the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in aquatic environments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd This work indicated that co-exposure with NP could alleviate the inhibitory effect, decrease the bioaccumulation and accelerate the biodegradation of IBU in C. pyrenoidosa. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Nanoplastics (<1000 nm) could pose a real and uncontrolled ecological challenge due to their smaller size and sharp ability to penetrate living organisms at any trophic level. Few studies evaluate the impact of nanoplastics in vivo on the immune system of aquatic organisms, while most of them assessed the impact on indirect markers of immune response such as regulation of gene expression, ROS production or DNA genotoxicity, among others. Moreover, the study of the effects of nanoplastics on aquatic vertebrate species in vivo is still scarce. In this context, we seek to shed light on the underlying effects of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) on the immune response in a model fish species (Danio rerio, zebrafish) after an acute exposure, with a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our results show that PS-NPs (65 nm) are efficiently taken up by zebrafish liver cells, accumulating mainly in lysosomes. Furthermore, the expression of immune genes presents a synergy when cells were simultaneously exposed to PS-NPs, at a low dose and early time point (12 h) and challenged with a viral stimulus (poly(I:C)). Moreover, zebrafish larvae also internalize PS-NPs, accumulating them in the gut and pancreas. However, at concentrations of up to 50 mg l-1 in an acute exposure (48 h), PS-NPs do not interfere with the survival of the larvae after a lethal bacterial challenge (Aeromonas hydrophila). This study addresses the relevant environmental question of whether a living organism exposed to PS-NPs can cope with a real immune threat. We show that, although PS-NPs can induce an immune response, the survival of zebrafish larvae challenged with a bacterial infection after an acute exposure to PS-NP is not decimated with respect to unexposed larvae. ?? 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

Numerous studies have shown that coral diseases are closely related to microorganisms. And microplastics (MPs) are a potential threat to corals. In marine ecosystems, MPs are an emerging contaminant. MPs have a strong adsorption effect on pollutants in the water environment, and they are very easily colonized by microorganisms to form biofilms. Biofilms may accumulate many pathogens, increasing the probability of coral disease. However, there is no report about the composition of biofilms on the surface of microplastics in coral growth areas. In this study, nine kinds of MPs were chosen in the experiments, which are commonly found in the ocean. Four stakeout points were selected in the coral area. Biofilms were cultivated in natural environment. The composition and distribution of biofilms on the surface of the MPs were analyzed by 16 S rRNA sequencing. The characteristics of biofilms were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experimental results show that the species composition and abundance distribution of the biofilm on the MP surface are significantly different from the surrounding seawater. The type of MPs and the stake out point are important factors affecting the structure of the biofilm bacterial community. Compared to seawater samples, MPs are enriched with certain dominant bacteria such as Vibrionaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Flavobacteraceae, Microtrichaceae and Sphingomonadaceae. Among them, Vibrionaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Flavobacteraceae are closely related to the tissue damage of stony corals, and Vibrios are also the main pathogens of coral albinism. In addition, Pseudomonas and Bbellvibrio cholerae are also detected on the MPs biofilm. SEM graphs of the MPs after culture could clearly observe rod-shaped bacteria and Streptococci. This study can provide a new direction for the study of coral toxicology by MPs and provide basic data for the toxicology research of MPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

We report here the monthly variation in the marine plastic litter (MPL) and its relative percentage to the quantity of fish caught from the trawling grounds off Cochin, Ratnagiri, Mumbai and Veraval along the west coast as well as Visakhapatnam from the east coast of India. The mean values of MPL from the fishing grounds registered the maximum of 55.2 ?? 16.52 kg/km2 off Veraval and the minimum of 2.11 ?? 0.55 kg/km2 off Visakhapatnam, registering a national average of 10.95 ?? 3.05 kg/km2. The relative percentage of MPL over the fish catch remained highest (3.83%) at Veraval and lowest from Visakhapatnam (0.33%) while, the national average was 1.89 ?? 0.28. Monsoon season registered maximum MPL in the fishing grounds of all the coastal regions we studied. Depth of the trawling grounds also influenced the quantity of MPL that 20 m depth registered quantity (24.25 ?? 9.16 kg/km2) and the overall mean at 10 m and 40 m depth zone are significantly different from that of 20 m. The database created through this study are discussed in the light of increasing deleterious effects of plastic pollution in the active fishing areas in coastal region and the urgent need to save the sea for sustainable use of its resources. ?? 2020",

This experiment assessed the uptake of either pristine or biofilm-coated MP particles and the physiological impacts for juvenile white seabream for MP concentrations consistent with those found in the field along with natural prey over a course of 3.5 weeks. Results indicate the ability of juvenile D. sargus to discriminate between edible and non-edible prey. A distinct preference for biofilm-coated over pristine particles could not be verified. No significant impact on growth and condition was found except for high levels of MP ingestion. The outcomes highlight the importance of performing MP feeding experiments mimicking natural conditions to reliably assess the impact of MP on early life stages of fish. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

On the other hand, the fate of non-conventional bioplastics in the marine environment is still unclear. In this study we have measured, by means of crystal violet test and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the ability of two model bacteria, Vibrio harveyi and Enterococcus faecalis, to form biofilms on low-density polyethylene (PE), polylactic acid (PLA) and starch-based bioplastic (SBB) surfaces. Experiments were conducted in artificial sea water, incubating squares of 3 cm2 of the three plastics with the two model microorganisms and sampling overnight, and at 3 and 6 days. The presence of biofilms on plastic surfaces was detected from day one of incubation and SBB was the material with the highest biofilm formation. E. faecalis formed the thickest biofilm after 3 days with PLA and SBB, but did not remain stable, and after 6 days with PE. The maximum biofilm formation of V. harveyi was obtained overnight with SBB and PE, and after 3 days with PLA. Our data indicate that both plastic and bioplastics support the formation of biofilms of model pathogenic bacteria, highlighting potential concerns for human health. ?? 2020 FEMS 2020.",

The present study evaluates mesoscale spatial (230 km, Catalan coast) and temporal (2007 vs 2017?€?2018, Barcelona area) differences on the ingestion of anthropogenic fibers in the deep-sea shrimp Aristeus antennatus in the NW Mediterranean Sea and its relation with shrimp's health condition. Synthetic fibers with lengths ranging between 0.16 and 37.9 mm were found in both stomach (where sometimes they were tangled up in balls) and intestine contents. The percentage of fiber occurrence was >65% at each sampling point. Tangled balls of fibers observed in stomach contents exhibited a wide range of sizes (up to a diameter of 1 cm) and were usually composed of fibers of different polymers, sizes and colours. Differences between locations (2018) were found, with greater fiber loads towards the south during spring and a great variability in summer, as shrimps caught off Barcelona showed a nearly thirty-times higher fiber load compared to shrimps from other localities. Highest concentrations were more likely to be related to major sources of fibers and currents in the area. Fiber load in shrimps from 2007 was comparable to that of shrimps captured in 2017 and 2018 (spring) yet a shift in the proportion of acrylic and polyester polymers was detected. No consistent effect on shrimp's health condition was found, with only a significant negative correlation found between gonadosomatic index and fibers for those shrimps with the highest values of fiber load (caught off Barcelona, summer 2018). Our findings contribute to the knowledge on plastic pollution for the NW Mediterranean Sea and highlight the potential use of this species as a sentinel species for plastic fiber contamination. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
87XTAPST,10.3390/RS12162648,Investigating detection of floating plastic litter from space using sentinel-2 imagery,"Plastic litter floating in the ocean is a significant problem on a global scale. This study examines whether Sentinel-2 satellite images can be used to identify plastic litter on the sea surface for monitoring, collection and disposal. A pilot study was conducted to determine if plastic targets on the sea surface can be detected using remote sensing techniques with Sentinel-2 data. A target made up of plastic water bottles with a surface measuring 3 m ?? 10 m was created, which was subsequently placed in the sea near the Old Port in Limassol, Cyprus. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to acquire multispectral aerial images of the area of interest during the same time as the Sentinel-2 satellite overpass. Spectral signatures of the water and the plastic litter after it was placed in the water were taken with an SVC HR1024 spectroradiometer. The study found that the plastic litter target was easiest to detect in the NIR wavelengths. Seven established indices for satellite image processing were examined to determine whether they can identify plastic litter in the water. Further, the authors examined two new indices, the Plastics Index (PI) and the Reversed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RNDVI) to be used in the processing of the satellite image. The newly developed Plastic Index (PI) was able to identify plastic objects floating on the water surface and was the most effective index in identifying the plastic litter target in the sea. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

However, little is known about the microplastics (MPs) accumulation in sea urchins. Here, we investigated the abundances and characteristics of MPs in specific tissues of wild sea urchins for 12 sites across 2, 900 km of coastlines in northern China. Sea urchins from all sites were detected to have MPs, with a total detection rate of 89.52%. The MPs abundance in sea urchins from all sites ranged from 2.20 ?? 1.50 to 10.04 ?? 8.46 items/individual or 0.16 ?? 0.09 to 2.25 ?? 1.68 items/g wet weight. The samples from Dalian were found to have the highest value by individual, and samples from Lianyungang had the highest value by gram. Furthermore, MPs were found in different tissues of sea urchins, i.e., gut, coelomic fluid and gonads. The highest abundance of MPs was found in the gut of sea urchins, followed by coelomic fluid and gonads. The size of MPs ranged from 27 to 4742 ??m, and the mean size found in gut was bigger than coelomic fluid and gonads. More interestingly, the MPs abundance increased with the decrease of anus size, shell diameter and gonad index (the wet weight ratio of gonad to total soft tissues). The MPs were dominated by fiber in shape, blue-green in colour and cellophane in composition. The high MPs abundance in sea urchins indicates the potential risks to human as they are consumed in many parts of the world, particularly in Asia and Europe. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
MJVHBIRB,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111268,A geostatistical approach to joint stakeholder prioritization for tackling marine plastics pollution in Hong Kong,"The pressing need to solve marine plastics pollution as a multi-source and multi-stakeholder problem is an ongoing global issue. This presents a challenge to policy makers tasked with understanding and accommodating different stakeholder perceptions and weighting their alternative propositions for solutions. In the case of Hong Kong, pollution of the marine environment by discarded plastics, polystyrenes and other items is a cumulative and accelerating problem that has yet to be resolved. We demonstrate how a geostatistical mapping approach can achieve joint stakeholder prioritization at any such regional scale. Joint prioritized area mapping is a methodology that links perspectives of otherwise disparate stakeholders to ecosystem-based-management, thereby balancing ecological, socio-economic and governance principles across temporal and spatial scales. It can serve as a generic scoping tool to help assess any marine spatial planning problem. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

PAHs are known to induce cardiotoxicity and visual toxicity at sublethal doses. Juvenile White seabass (Atractoscion nobilis) fish were fed environmentally relevant concentrations of either virgin polystyrene or benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)-sorbed polystyrene for 5 days and were monitored for changes in phototactic response, swimming behavior, and hepatic cytochrome p450 1A (CYP1A) enzyme activity. No significant differences in the monitored endpoints were recorded in fish that ingested either polystyrene or BaP-sorbed polystyrene relative to control fish following the short-term exposure. However, fish exposed to 252 ??g/L BaP alone as a positive control had significantly elevated CYP1A enzyme activity (p = 0.046) and impaired phototactic response (p = 0.020), though no altered swimming behavior was observed (p = 0.843) relative to control fish. These results demonstrate that pelagic fish ingesting environmentally relevant concentrations of BaP-sorbed polystyrene for a short, 5-day duration do not demonstrate measurable changes in vision, swimming activity, nor CYP1A activity. High variability within enzyme activity and behavioral responses suggest that lack of significant effects may be due to low sample size. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

However, the immunotoxic impacts of these two types of pollutants and the underlying toxication mechanisms still remain largely unknown in sessile filter-feeding bivalve mollusks. Therefore, the impacts of exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons and MPs alone or in combination on the total count, cell type composition, and phagocytic activity of hemocytes were investigated in the blood clam, Tegillarca granosa. In addition, the intracellular ROS content, cell viability, degree of DNA damage, and expression levels of genes from immune-, apoptosis-, and immunotoxicity-related pathways were analyzed to reveal the potential toxication mechanisms. The results demonstrated that exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons and MPs alone or in combination at environmentally realistic concentrations could exert significant immunotoxic impacts on the blood clam, which may be caused by alterations in a series of physiological and molecular processes. In addition, the immunotoxicity of petroleum hydrocarbons could be significantly aggravated by the copresence of MPs, which suggests that coexposure to these two pollutants deserves closer attention. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Marine plastic polymers identified as polyethylene, polyethylene/ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and polypropylene, yielded a total of 37 bacterial isolates dominated by Pseudomonas spp. (70%). Six isolates representing either fish pathogens or opportunistic human pathogens were selected for whole genome sequencing (WGS). These included four isolates belonging to Aeromonas spp., one Acinetobacter beijerinckii isolate and one Morganella morganii isolate. Three Aeromonas salmonicida isolates were potentially virulent and carried virulence factors involved in attachment, type II and type VI secretion systems as well as toxins such as aerA/act, ahh1, ast, hlyA, rtxA and toxA.

Studies on seabirds have focused on species that ingest plastics mistaken for prey or indirectly through their preferred prey or, on how foraging strategy influences this behaviour. We evaluated plastic ingestion in relation to the proximity of nests to areas with different anthropogenic pressure, breeding status and breeding stage. We analyzed regurgitated pellets (n = 1001) from a seabird, the Brown Skua (Stercorarius antarcticus lonnbergi) at Esperanza/Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula. Plastics were found in 9% of pellets, only in breeders from an area with high antropogenic activity. The prevalence of plastic increased during the brooding of chicks stage, when skuas expand their feeding niche. Our results support previous work which demonstrated that seabirds with wider feeding niche show higher loads of plastics. Altogether, this provides insights into the dynamics of plastic transfer within the environment. ?? 2020",

Such sites, however, may be exposed to the potential impacts from broader scale pressures, such as anthropogenic litter, due to its diffuse nature and lack of constraint by legislative and/or political boundaries. Plastic, a large component of litter, is of particular concern, due to increasing evidence of its potential to cause ecological and socio-economic damage. The presence of sensitive marine features may mean that some MPAs are at greater potential risk from the impacts of plastic pollution than some non-protected sites. Understanding the abundance, distribution and composition of litter along coastlines is important for designing and implementing effective management strategies. Gathering such data, however, can be expensive and time-consuming but litter survey programmes that enlist citizen scientists are often able to resolve many of the logistical or financial constraints. Here, we examine data collected over 25-years (1994?€?2018), by Marine Conservation Society volunteers, for spatial patterns in relation to the English MPA network, with the aim of highlighting key sources of litter and identifying management priority areas. We found that MPAs in southeast (Kent) and southwest (Cornwall and Devon) England have the highest densities of shore-based litter. Plastic is the main material constituent and public littering the most common identifiable source. Items attributed to fishing activities were most prevalent in southwest MPAs and sewage related debris was highest in MPAs near large rivers and estuaries, indicating localised accumulation. When comparing inside and outside of MPAs, we found no difference in litter density, demonstrating the need for wider policy intervention at local, national and international scales to reduce the amount of litter. ?? 2020",

The prevalence of plastics in seabird nests has been used as an indicator of levels of this pollutant in the ocean. However, the lack of a framework for defining sample sizes and errors associated with estimating the prevalence of plastic in nests prevents researchers from optimising time and reducing impacts of fieldwork. We present a method to determine the confidence intervals for the prevalence of debris in seabird nests and provide, for the first time, information on the prevalence of these items in nests of the Hartlaub's gull Larus hartlaubii, the African penguin Spheniscus demersus, the great white pelican Pelecanus onocrotalus, and the white-breasted cormorant Phalacrocorax lucidus in South Africa. The method, based on observations and resampling simulations and tested here for nests of 12 seabird species from 15 locations worldwide, allows for straightforward hypothesis testing. Appropriate sample sizes can be defined by combining this method with a Bayesian approach. We show that precise estimates of prevalence of debris in nests can be obtained by sampling around 250 nests. Smaller sample sizes can be useful for obtaining rough estimates. For the Hartlaub's gull, the African penguin, the great white pelican, and the white-breasted cormorant, debris were present in 0.75%, 3.00%, 6.41%, and 25.62% of the respective nests. Our approach will help researchers to determine errors associated with the prevalence of debris recorded in seabird nests and to optimise time and costs spent collecting data.

Analytical pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) is a promising technique to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on microplastics mixtures through the selection of a set of characteristic pyrolysis products for each polymer. However, this data processing method is time-consuming, and no automated algorithms are currently available. In the present work, a new method for the qualitative analysis of eleven types of synthetic polymers was developed, automated and implemented in the F-Search software, with the aim of proposing a standardized procedure for data processing in Py-GC/MS analysis of plastics mixtures. The method improves on the current literature, and is based on the generation of summated mass spectra (SMS) for each polymer, obtained by extracting specific m/z and retention index coordinates corresponding to characteristic pyrolysis products. The identification of a polymer is performed by comparing its SMS with those of a built-in library. After validation, the algorithm was tested on a reference sample containing all eleven investigated polymers. The algorithm provided relative standard deviations around 10%, and the results were used to estimate the lowest amount of polymer detectable in a sample, which was found lower than 1 ??g for most polymers. The performance of the algorithm was also evaluated on a real sample from ocean water trawling, providing positive results for four different polymers. The performances of the algorithm are discussed, and possible future developments are outlined. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

These measurements have been recommended by the recent US NRC Decadal Review for NASA as being priority variables for the coming decade of Earth observations. In addition, currents and winds are useful for many applications, including assessing the operating conditions for oil platforms or tracking the dispersal of plastic or oil by surface currents and winds. While promising, Doppler scatterometry is relatively new and understanding the measurement characteristics is an important area of research. To this end, Chevron sponsored the deployment of DopplerScatt, a NASA/JPL Ka-band Doppler scatterometer, over instrumented sites located at the edge of a Gulf of Mexico Loop Current Eddy (LCE). In addition to in situ measurements, coincident synoptic maps of surface currents were collected by the Aret?? ROCIS instrument, an optical current measurement system. Here we report on the results of this experiment for both surface currents and winds. Surface current comparisons show that the Ka-band Current Geophysical Model Function (CGMF) needs to include wind drift currents, which could not be estimated with prior data sets. Once the CGMF is updated, ROCIS and DopplerScatt show good agreement for surface current speeds, but, at times, direction differences on the order of 10?? can occur. Remote sensing optical and radar data agree better among themselves than with ADCP currents measured at 5 m depth, showing that remote sensing is sensitive to the the currents in top 1 m of the ocean. The LCE data provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of surface currents and stability conditions on scatterometer winds. We show that, like Ku-band, Ka-band estimates of winds are related to neutral winds (and wind stress) and are referenced relative to the moving frame provided by the current. This is useful for the study of air-sea interactions, but must be accounted for when using scatterometer winds for weather prediction. ?? 2020 by the authors.",
UU87FQDQ,10.1371/journal.pone.0237704,"Bacterial biofilms colonizing plastics in estuarine waters, with an emphasis on Vibrio spp. And their antibacterial resistance","Since plastics degrade very slowly, they remain in the environment on much longer timescales than most natural organic substrates and provide a novel habitat for colonization by bacterial communities. The spectrum of relationships between plastics and bacteria, however, is little understood. The first objective of this study was to examine plastics as substrates for communities of Bacteria in estuarine surface waters. We used next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize communities from plastics collected in the field, and over the course of two colonization experiments, from biofilms that developed on plastic (low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polystyrene) and glass substrates placed in the environment. Both field sampling and colonization experiments were conducted in estuarine tributaries of the lower Chesapeake Bay. As a second objective, we concomitantly analyzed biofilms on plastic substrates to ascertain the presence and abundance of Vibrio spp. bacteria, then isolated three human pathogens, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus, and determined their antibiotic-resistant profiles. In both components of this study, we compared our results with analyses conducted on paired samples of estuarine water. This research adds to a nascent literature that suggests environmental factors govern the development of bacterial communities on plastics, more so than the characteristics of the plastic substrates themselves. In addition, this study is the first to culture three pathogenic vibrios from plastics in estuaries, reinforcing and expanding upon earlier reports of plastic pollution as a habitat for Vibrio species. The antibiotic resistance detected among the isolates, coupled with the longevity of plastics in the aqueous environment, suggests biofilms on plastics have potential to persist and serve as focal points of potential pathogens and horizontal gene transfer.

The use of tires in vehicles consumes 6% of the world's energy and causes 5% of carbon dioxide emissions; it accounts for up to 10% of the microplastic pollution found in oceans. Here, a new rubber nanocomposite self-assembled from hard and soft elastomer matrixes is designed: polybutadiene with its two hydroxy chain ends reacts with 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate to form segmented polyurethane. This system first undergoes self-assembly, forming well-defined nanoscale hard domains distributed in the soft matrix. Then, cross-linking between the soft segments is accomplished by a controlled radiation method, resulting in the double network elastomer (DN-E). Remarkably, the DN-E exhibits the lowest reported loss factor value at 60 ??C. The index of energy dissipation in the rolling tire demonstrates a prominent reduction of 72%, accomplished with an 88% decrease in energy loss, and 85% less wear loss, as compared with best earlier reported commercial tires. These new double-network materials open a new prospective for the design and fabrication of ultralow energy-consumption and strong abrasion-resistance elastomers, which establishes a milestone for the development of the next generation of green low-pollution tires causing much less energy dissipation. ?? 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

9HTUSLBG,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124923,A framework for ?€?Inclusive Multiple Modelling?€? with critical views on modelling practices ?€? Applications to modelling water levels of Caspian Sea and Lakes Urmia and Van,"A framework is formulated in this paper for data-driven modelling practices to characterise Inclusive Multiple Modelling (IMM) practices with multiple goals of enhancing the extracted information from given datasets and learning from multiple models. This can be a shift from traditional practices with the single goal of selecting a ?€?superior?€? model from multiple models without a statistical justification, which may be referred to as Exclusionary Multiple Modelling (EMM) practices. The dimensions of the framework for IMM practices are: Model Reuse (MR), Hierarchy and/or Recursion (HR), a provision of ?€?Elastic?€? model-Learning Environment (ELE) and Goal-Orientation (GO) ?€? leading to the acronym of RHEO. Proof-of-concept is presented for IMM-RHEO using three testcases: the Caspian Sea (19-years of data), Lake Urmia (50-years of data) and Lake Van (73-years of data), approx. 500 km apart. IMM practices are implemented by investigating four strategies for each testcase. The learning from the results includes: (i) the IMM strategies are capable of enhancing the accuracy of predicted water levels; (ii) the accuracy of predicting the sea-state of the Caspian Sea serves confidence building on accuracy; and (iii) the time-length of the record of Lake Van is long enough for the confidence building on the study of possible trends. IMM serves a bottom-up learning opportunity for Lake Urmia that its distressed state is due to being deprived of compensation flows without contributions from climate change. Arguably, a good management policy is the key for its restoration. IMM is at its infancy but arguably, its potential application areas are wide. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Indisputably, what is needed is not just a reduction in the emissions of CO2 (greenhouse gases in general) from the technosphere, but also a manipulated diversion of CO2 from the atmosphere to 'traps' in the lithosphere, technosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The case study in this paper focused on Stockholm Exergi's proposed waste-to-energy incineration plant in L??vsta, which is keen on incorporating carbon capture and storage (CCS), but is also interested in understanding the potential of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCU/S) in helping it to achieve 'carbon-dioxide-negativity'. Waste-to-energy incineration plants (in cases where the petro-plastics in the waste mix can be substantially reduced) are a key component of a circular bio-economy, though the circularity here pertains to recovering energy from materials which may or may not be recyclable. CCS (storage in the North Sea) was compared with CCU/S (CO2 sintered into high-quality building blocks made of recycled slag from the steel sector) from techno-economic and environmental perspectives. The comparative analysis shows, inter alia, that a hybridized approach-a combination of CCS and CCU/S-is worth investing in. CCU/S, at the time of writing, is simply a pilot project in Belgium, a possible creatively-destructive technology which may or may not usurp prominence from CCS. The authors believe that political will and support with incentives, subsidies, and tax rebates are indispensable to motivate investments in such ground-breaking technologies and moving away from the easier route of paying carbon taxes or purchasing emission rights. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

In this paper, SSC columns reinforced with polypropylene (PP) fibers and GFRP bars under axial and eccentric compression were tested. The bearing capacity of axial and small eccentric compression column and the crack width of eccentric compression column were theoretically analyzed. The research result showed: for axial compression testing, the increase of longitudinal reinforcement ratio had little influence on the test results, and the contribution of GFRP bars to the ultimate bearing capacity for axial compression columns was small. For eccentric compression testing, eccentricity had a significant influence on the mechanical properties of the test columns, while the reinforcement ratio had little effect. In addition, PP fibers could restrain crack development in SSC effectively. The theoretical result of the crack width of eccentric compression columns and the ultimate bearing capacity of axial and small eccentric compression columns agreed well with the experimental data.

JF6JTP73,10.3390/app10155100,Low temperature decomposition of polystyrene,"Styrene oligomers (SOs), of styrene (styrene monomer, SM), 1,3-diphenylpropane (styrene dimer, SD1), 2,4-diphenyl-1-butene (styrene dimer, SD2) and 2,4,6-triphenyl-1-hexene (styrene trimer, ST), had been detected in the natural environments far from industrial area. To confirm SOs formation through thermal decomposition of polystyrene (PS) wastes in the nature, purified polystyrene (SO-free PS) has been shown to decompose at 30 to 150 ??C. The SO ratio of SM:SD:ST was about 1:1:5 with ST as the main product. Mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring was used for the quantitative analysis of the trace amounts of SOs. The rate of PS decomposition was obtained as k (year-1) = 5.177 exp(-5029/T(K)) based on the amount of ST. Decomposition kinetics indicated that not only does drifting lump PS break up into micro/nano pieces in the ocean, but that it also subsequently undergoes degradation into basic structure units SO. According to the simulation at 30 ??C, the amounts of SOs in the ocean will be over 400 MT in 2050. ?? 2020 by the authors.",
HSIWUJY6,10.1002/col.22504,Artificial neural network approach to predict the lightfastness of gravure prints on the plastic film,"The lightfastness of prints is an important property for assessing their print stability. The objective of this study is to determine the lightfastness rate of printed films due to long-time exposure by applying artificial neural network (ANN). Package printing is gradually becoming extremely important because its color and quality increase the marketability of the product. Sometimes it has been observed that the initial print quality is bright and attractive. However, with time, it degrades the exposure of light, water, or other external parameters. Thus, it reduces the marketability if its color degrades before its expiration. Therefore, the lightfastness of prints may be considered for the authenticity or validity of the product. The plastic film substrate is chosen because it has extensive usage in food and other packaging industries. The samples printed in the gravure process are exposed in artificial lightfastness tester BGD 865/A Bench Xenon Test Chamber (B-SUN) for assessing the lightfastness of prints. The ocean optics spectroradiometer (DH2000BAL) is used to measure the spectrophotometric properties of prints before and after exposure. The obtained reflectance spectra are modeled by applying an ANN technique that is proposed to predict the fading rate of the printed film. The optimal model gives excellent prediction with the minimum mean square error for each color and a correlation coefficient of 0.80 to 0.99. ANN model and a Regression model (assuming first-order kinetic equation) are compared for predicting the lightfastness properties of prints. The results show that the ANN has better prediction capability than the regression model. ?? 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

With this aim, 403 individuals of both sexes were exposed to TCPP concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 10 ??g/L, EE2 (0.01 ??g/L), seawater and solvent controls for 7 and 28 days. EE2 and TCPP exposure did not cause histological damage in the gonads. Some evidence of estrogenic effects of TCPP within the ??g/L range and EE2 within the ng/L range is reported. Females exposed to 1 ??g/L TCPP for 7 days showed a significant increase in gonad development assessed as gametogenic stage, females exposed to 10 ??g/L TCPP showed increased gonad development both in terms of weight (Gonad Index, GI, at both 7 and 28 days) and maturation (Pixelar Index, PI), and females exposed to 10 ng/L EE2 showed increased PI after 28 days exposure. Male sea urchins exposed to both TCPP and EE2 for 7 days showed increased frequencies of low development gonad stage. However, the patterns of response are affected by the high inter-individual variability, the differing initial stage of the gonad, as well as the dosage administered. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

The structures used for military applications are susceptible to shock loadings from an underwater explosion. It is imperative to understand the shock damage mechanism of such structures to design for survivability. The problem is quite complex involving explosive-fluid interaction, fluid-structure interaction, material, geometric nonlinearity and strain rate effects. In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the shock response of a ring stiffened cylindrical shell of length 1000 mm, diameter 600 mm and thickness 6 mm shock tested using small explosive charge of 70 gm PEK I. The numerical study is performed using LS-DYNA finite element code considering the fluid-structure interaction, strain rate effects, geometric and material nonlinearity. The stiffened cylinder under consideration is modelled using Belytschko-Tsay shell element and the fluid and explosive using Eulerian solid element. The explosive is modelled using JWL equation of state, the fluid using Gruneisen equation of state and the stiffened cylinder fluid interaction using ALE coupling. The permanent deformation obtained from the numerical study compares well with experimental results within 5% accuracy. Subsequently, parametric investigation has been carried out for various charge weights with different cylindrical shell thickness and the results of permanent deformation, effective plastic strain are presented. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

To this purpose, collected bottles were washed, cut, grinded, extruded in the form of a thin wire adopting different cooling rates, which leads to a modulation of the crystallinity content. Once having optimized the processing parameters, the extruded wire was used to produce 3D printed samples through the fused deposition modelling (FDM). The changes in the crystalline structure due to the different processing conditions were assessed by DSC and XRD analyses, while rheological tests were performed in order to evaluate any modification in the viscosity of PET after repeated processing cycles. The reduction in thermal stability was confirmed by TGA analysis, which showed a progressive decrease in the degradation temperature as processing cycles increased. Finally, tensile tests highlighted the difference in the mechanical response due to the predominance of the crystalline or amorphous phase in the tested sample. In particular, a good mechanical behavior was found for the 3D-printed samples. ?? 2020 by the authors.",
NKWPREE5,10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112334,On lateral crashworthiness of aluminum/composite hybrid structures,"To improve the lightweight and crashworthiness in vehicular engineering, there has been growing interests in metal/composite hybrid configuration, which is relatively newer than traditional metallic or composite structures. It is of vital importance to understand lateral crushing behaviors of hybrid system to gain maximum benefits from the structural configuration. In this present study, quasi-static lateral compression tests were carried out experimentally to investigate the transverse failure modes and crashworthiness characteristics of four different circular hybrid tubes made of either aluminum/carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) or aluminum/glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) materials. From the experiments, it is found that the load carrying capacity of the aluminum/composite hybrid tubes with an inner composite tube was substantially higher than that of hybrid tubes with an outer composite counterpart. This is due to the fact that more significant delamination was initiated and propagated around the inner composite tube under transverse loading, which improved its lateral crushing characteristics. The interactive effects between single aluminum tube and single composite (CFRP or GFRP) tube was also investigated; and it is found that the specific energy absorption (SEA) of hybrid tube AL-T2-CF-P8 (2.41 J/g) and AL-T2-GF-P8 (2.27 J/g) were 58% and 47% higher than the sum of single aluminum tube and single composite tube alone, respectively. Based upon the experimental results, the finite element (FE) models were developed and validated to further explore the effects of hybrid ratios (i.e. aluminum vs. CFRP/GFRP of 4:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3 and 0:4) and stacking sequence on lateral crashworthiness. It is found that the aluminum thickness of a higher-ratio configuration can largely improve the load carrying and energy absorption capacities under lateral compression. For the six different stacking sequences considered here, the hybrid tubes with a symmetrical configurations [CF-P4-AL-T1]s and [GF-P4-AL-T1]s are of the best crashworthiness performance with the highest SEA of 3.43 J/g and 3.29 J/g, respectively. This study provides thorough understanding of the aluminum/composite hybrid tube subject to transverse crushing load, and would be of considerable implication to vehicular applications. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Parts of the causes of this may be linked to waste products from plastics and rubber tires. This study focuses on fibers from rubber tires, and successfully produces rubber aerogels from them using glutaraldehyde and poly(vinyl alcohol) binders, followed by a freeze-drying process. Our recycled rubber aerogels are extremely pore (92.2-98.3 %) and ultra-low density (0.020-0.091 g/cm3). After a methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) coating, rubber aerogels show their super-hydrophobic properties with a water contact angle up to 153??. The effects of rubber fiber and cross-linker contents on the rubber aerogel oil absorption efficiency are thoroughly investigated. Pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics are studied for the absorption of rubber aerogel and the result shows that the pseudo-second-order model could better predict oil absorption performance. A maximum rubber aerogel oil absorption of up to 25.0 g/g is estimated, approximately 1.7 and 2.8 times higher compared to commercial polypropylene mat and nonwoven polypropylene, respectively. Such a material can play an instrumental role towards recycling of car tires and paves the way for maximizing the recycling capacity of waste rubber tires globally. This will in turn reduce the global and environmental impact of waste pollution associated with untreated car tires. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd.",

For this, we introduced various amounts of halloysite nanotubes into the epoxy and the halloysite nanotube?€?epoxy mixtures were used to impregnate to basalt fabrics via vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding, subsequently. Fracture performances of the halloysite nanotubes modified epoxy and basalt/epoxy composite laminated were evaluated separately.

The interlaminar shear strength and Mode-I interlaminar fracture toughness (GIC) of basalt?€?epoxy hybrid composites were enhanced from 36.1 to 42.9 MPa and from 1.22 to 1.44 kJ/m2, respectively. Moreover, the hybrid composites exhibited improved seawater aging performance by almost 52% and 34% in interlaminar shear strength and GIC values compared to the neat basalt-epoxy composites after conditioning in seawater for six months, respectively.

The mathematical model is based on the unified governing equation, incorporating both pure fluid and vegetation regions. The governing equation consists of additional force terms such as the resistance given by vegetation. This additional force term derived from Morison's equation, where the vegetation is assumed to be a series of cylinders or strips. The drag force term for strip/square type vegetation is reported in the present study. The interface between fluid and vegetation region has a smooth variation of porous rate using transition zone to avoid discontinuity. The model is validated using the available experimental results.

The method is based on the Biot consolidation theory, and special emphasis is placed on modeling the high?€?strain behavior of the liquefiable seabed and the evolving boundary conditions at the tunnel?€?seabed interface. Motivated by the experimental results, the existing Masing model is extended to the high?€?strain regime in the cyclic plasticity framework to capture the liquefaction?€?induced nonlinear behavior of the sand. In particular, a newly?€?observed shear?€?volume coupling model is implemented into plastic flow rule to realize volumetric compaction by cyclic shearing and exercise as the source term for residual excess pore pressure accumulation in the Biot's equation. Subsequently, the proposed cyclic plasticity model is implanted into an explicit time matching finite difference analysis platform, permitting a comprehensive simulation of the intensive response of the immersed tunnel in the seabed experiencing the excess pore pressure accumulation and residual liquefaction. Moreover, a model calibration procedure is presented based on the cyclic laboratory sample test data and prescribed loading paths. Finally, the liquefaction?€?induced uplift of an immersed tunnel under progressive wave action is studied numerically.

Amphiphilic polymers have been proven to be an effective method to combat fouling in the marine environment. This study reports the incorporation of small amounts of zwitterionic carboxybetaine methacrylate (CBMA) into hydrophobic ethylene glycol dicyclopentenyl ether acrylate (DCPEA). A new set of copolymers with varying amphiphilicities was synthesized and coated on chemically modified glass substrates. The antifouling capabilities were assessed against the diatom Navicula perminuta and multiple species in the field. Unsurprisingly, high diatom densities were observed on the hydrophobic control coatings. The integration of small zwitterionic contents of only ???5 wt % was already sufficient to rapidly form a hydrophilic interface that led to a strong reduction of fouling. Ultralow fouling was also observed for the pure zwitterionic coatings in laboratory experiments, but it failed when tested in the real ocean environment. We noticed that the ability to absorb large amounts of water and the diffuse nature of the interphase correlate with the adsorption of silt, which can mask the hydrophilic chemistries and facilitate the settlement of organisms. The amphiphilic coatings showed low fouling in dynamic short-term field exposures, which could be explained by the reduced tendency of the coatings for sediment adsorption.

Herein, a novel type of cellulose-based sustainable material, paper-polyimine composites (PPCs), were developed via the functionalization of cellulose papers using polyimine covalent adaptable networks (CANs). The polyimine infiltrates into the porous structure of cellulose papers and non-covalently bonds to cellulose fiber networks via hydrogen bonding, forming interpenetrating networks. The tensile strength and Young's modulus of PPCs can reach 71 MPa and 3.2 GPa, which are significantly higher than those of most commercially available plastics. The PPCs exhibit good malleability, re-healability, weldability, and moldability. The closed-loop recycling of the polymer matrix and cellulose papers has also been demonstrated. The recycled materials can be 100% reused in the production of next generation composites. More importantly, such PPCs exhibit excellent waterproof performance, superhigh gas (oxygen and moisture) barrier capability, and excellent solvent resistance. Therefore, PPCs represent a novel class of highly green and sustainable materials that can be used as plastic replacements. ?? The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

In order to prevent the overestimation of litter ingestion, we applied severe mitigation measures to avoid airborne contamination during the analyses, integrating a new approach for the correction of estimates of fibers abundance using control procedure. In this study, we assessed the anthropogenic litter ingestion in four elasmobranch species from the southern Tyrrhenian Sea: Scyliorhinus canicula (n = 27), Etmopterus spinax (n = 16), Galeus melastomus (n = 12), and Raja clavata (n = 6). The GIT of each specimen was analyzed by visual sorting and the polymers identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy technique. Overall, 19 litter particles were found in the GIT of 13 demersal elasmobranchs (%O = 21) and for the first time, evidence of litter ingestion by R. clavata in Mediterranean waters was also reported. In G. melastomus and R. clavata all anthropogenic particles were plastics, whereas in S. canicula other litter categories were also found. No litter ingestion was instead observed in E. spinax. More than 50% of litter particles belonged to microlitter category (<5 mm). Polyamide was the only polymer typology found in all examined species. We described the procedures to control the airborne contamination applied at each step of laboratory analysis and, thanks to the application of our control method, it was possible to exclude the 95% of fibers found in samples from the assessment. Moreover, we compared fibers abundances observed in samples and controls. This study, combining an approach for minimizing the bias associated to airborne fiber contamination, provided a reliable assessment of marine litter ingestion in demersal elasmobranchs. ??

While more than eight billion tons of plastics have been produced until today, only a small fraction is currently collected for recycling and large amounts of plastic waste are ending up in landfills and in the oceans. Pollution caused by accumulating plastic waste in the environment has become worldwide a serious problem. Synthetic polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) have widespread use in food packaging materials, beverage bottles, coatings and fibres. Recently, it has been shown that post-consumer PET can be hydrolysed by microbial enzymes at mild reaction conditions in aqueous media. In a circular plastics economy, the resulting monomers can be recovered and re-used to manufacture PET products or other chemicals without depleting fossil feedstocks and damaging the environment. The enzymatic degradation of post-consumer plastics thereby represents an innovative, environmentally benign and sustainable alternative to conventional recycling processes. By the construction of powerful biocatalysts employing protein engineering techniques, a biocatalytic recycling of PET can be further developed towards industrial applications.

RA8D2EFN,10.1021/acs.est.9b07378,Characteristics and Sinking Behavior of Typical Microplastics including the Potential Effect of Biofouling: Implications for Remediation,"Microplastics are ubiquitous pollutants within the marine environment, predominantly (>90%) accumulating in sediments worldwide. Despite the increasing global concern regarding these anthropogenic pollutants, research into the remediation of microplastics is lacking. Here, we examine those characteristics of microplastics that are essential to adequately evaluate potential remediation techniques such as sedimentation and (air) flotation techniques. We analyzed the sinking behavior of typical microplastics originating from real plastic waste samples and identified the best-available drag model to quantitatively describe their sinking behavior. Particle shape is confirmed to be an important parameter strongly affecting the sinking behavior of microplastics. Various common shape descriptors were experimentally evaluated on their ability to appropriately characterize frequently occurring particle shapes of typical microplastics such as spheres, films, and fibers. This study is the first in this field to include film particles in its experimental design, which were found to make up a considerable fraction of marine pollution and are shown to significantly affect the evaluation of shape-dependent drag models. Circularity ?? and sphericity ?? are found to be appropriate shape descriptors in this context. We also investigated the effect of biofouling on the polarity of marine plastics and estimated its potential contribution to the settling motion of initially floating microplastics based on density-modification. It is found that biofouling alters the polarity of plastics significantly; this is from (near) hydrophobic (i.e., water contact angles from 70 to 100??) to strong hydrophilic (i.e., water contact angles from 30 to 40??) surfaces, rendering them more difficult to separate from sediment based on polarity as a primary separation factor. Thus, besides providing a better understanding of the fate and behavior of typical marine microplastics, these findings serve as a fundamental stepping-stone to the development of the first large-scale sediment remediation technique for microplastics to address the global microplastic accumulation issue. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

The objective of this paper is to review microplastics and analyze its possible impact on wildlife and seabird. Seabirds are upper-trophic level predators in marine ecosystems, feed on zooplankton, fish, and squid. Microplastics in seabirds have been reported in many countries, including the USA, Canada, Brazil, Japan, China, the Netherlands, and North Pacific region, involving albatrosses, petrels, storm-petrels, fulmars, cormorants, shearwaters, penguins, and many other seabird species. Microplastics were accidentally ingested because of their resemblance to the fish, plankton, or from ingestion of microplastics that already occurred inside fish food. Types of microplastics were pellet, fragment, film, fiber, foamed plastic and styrofoam. Microplastics might decrease feeding stimuli by producing a false sense of fullness, causing the bird to stop eating, resulting in malnutrition and death. Other harmful impact on birds are interrupting nutrient absorption, disrupting reproductive problems, and hindered growth and survival of chicks. Study on microplastics in Indonesia is in progress, by using Little-black cormorant to represent seabirds. ?? Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",
IZD8EQNC,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138653,"Limited long-distance transport of plastic pollution by the Orange-Vaal River system, South Africa","Much of the plastic waste entering the sea is thought to be transported from land by rivers, yet little is known about the distances over which rivers transport plastic. To address this knowledge gap, we collected surface water samples from the Orange-Vaal River at the end of the wet and dry seasons. The Vaal River drains South Africa's main urban-industrial centre, whereas the upper Orange River is sparsely populated. Below their confluence, the river flows through increasingly arid regions with very low human populations before entering the Atlantic Ocean. We collected bulk water samples from 33 bridges to test for microplastic and microfibre (0.025?€?1 mm) pollution and conducted observations for macrodebris (&gt;50 mm). Where possible, we sampled for plastic fragments (&gt;1 mm) using a neuston net. Microfibres and microplastics were found at every site (1.7 ?? 5.1 L???1, &gt;99% fibres) and accounted for 99% of the number of items recorded. Microfibres and microplastics were particularly abundant in the lower reaches during the period of low flow prior to the wet season flush. Macrodebris and larger microplastics were orders of magnitude less abundant (observations: 0.0002 ?? 0.0007 items??m???2; neuston net: 0.34 ?? 0.93 items??m???2). However, at sites where larger items were found, they comprised most of the mass of plastic. Larger plastics were found mostly at sites in the upper reaches of the Vaal River. Our results suggest that, while the Orange-Vaal River system may be a source of microfibres to the Atlantic Ocean, larger plastic items typically only travel short distances. The Orange-Vaal River system therefore does not appear to be a major source of plastics into the Atlantic Ocean, at least under regular flow conditions. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
FS38H8ZV,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138668,In situ degradation of biodegradable plastic mulch films in compost and agricultural soils,"The global use of agricultural plastic films, which provide multiple benefits for food production, is expected to grow by 59% from 2018 to 2026. Disposal options for agricultural plastics are limited and a major global concern, as plastic fragments from all sources ultimately accumulate in the sea. Biodegradable plastic mulches could potentially alleviate the disposal problem, but little is known about how well they degrade under different environmental conditions. We quantified the degradation of biodegradable plastic mulches in compost and in soil at warm and cool climates (Tennessee and Washington). Mulch degradation was assessed by Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, molecular weight analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR), and mulch surface-area quantification. Biodegradable plastic mulches degraded faster in compost than in soil: degradation, as assessed by surface-area reduction, in compost ranged from 85 to 99% after 18 weeks, and in soil from 61 to 83% in Knoxville and 26 to 63% in Mount Vernon after 36 months. FTIR analyses indicate that hydrolytic degradation of ester bonds occurred, and a significant reduction of molecular weight was observed. TGA and NMR confirmed degradation of biodegradable polymers. Our results indicate that biodegradable plastic mulches degrade in soil, but at different rates in different climates and that degradation occurs over several years. Faster degradation occurred in compost, making composting a viable disposal method, especially in cool climates, where mulch fragments in soil may persist for many years. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Therefore, a solution is needed to solve plastic waste problem in Indonesia. The objectives of the study is to know the effect of using High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) waste on characteristics of asphalt concrete AC - WC based on the Marshall Test, compare the characteristics produced based on dry and wet mixing process, and evaluate whether the test results fulfil Bina Marga Specification 2018. By the result of wet process, stability value of 7% HDPE increased up to 38.08% and 8% LDPE content increased up to 22.03% and for the dry process, 9% HDPE and 11% LDPE increase the stability value up to 24.61% and 19.30% respectively. The use of HDPE or LDPE can increase stability of asphalt concrete mixing both in dry and wet process. We can use up to 8.7 ton of plastic waste into 1 km of 7-meter-wide asphalt pavement road. ?? 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.",

In this study, polyacrylic acid (PA) emulsion and white Portland cement were selected as the main raw materials to prepare highly flexible PCCs, then the dispersibility of ultrafine SiO2 powders and its influences on the basic, tensile properties and durability of PCCs were deeply investigated. Excitingly, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) successfully dispersed SiO2 powders based on the change of surface charge number. It was found the PCCs with 4 wt% HMDS modified SiO2 powders had fewer micro-defects and more compactness, thus the tensile properties and durability under different conditions, such as water, acid, alkali, heat and artificial aging, were significantly improved. The water absorption and chloride ion permeability coefficient of concrete coated by the PCCs with 4 wt% well-dispersed SiO2 powders were also decreased. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Inhabited, transformed and modelled since ancient times by the local rural communities, an extraordinary cultural landscape has been created through their particular relationship with the environment. Since the pre-Hispanic settlements (Wari 600 AD), through colonial indigenous ?€?reductions?€?, to the villages of vernacular architecture, which are at the foundation of contemporary populated centres, the territory has been variously and successively settled, inhabited and transformed. Its vernacular architecture has evolved at multiple scales, from domestic architecture to urban structures. It has created spaces for agriculture and livestock herding, and the spectacular agricultural andener??as (farming platforms and terraces) that have shaped the territory for centuries. The latter simultaneously developed irrigation infrastructures and techniques. The result is a landscape of great plastic effects, in a geographical setting bordered by the apus - tutelar mountains - traditionally ?€?sacralized?€? by the Andean cultures. Such enormous architectural-landscape legacy is now threatened by imported global models of false modernity disrupting the fragile balance of lifestyles and territories. The objective of this research project, ongoing since 2016, is to assess this territory, catalogue its vernacular architecture and landscape units. It also aims to propose projects and initiatives for sustainable local development.

Moreover, many-sided behavior of waste plastic (lightweight, flexible, cheap, strong, and moisture-resistant) can make it a replacement for or alternative to coarse aggregate in concrete. This paper investigates the properties and strength of reinforced concrete flat plate slabs using recycled waste plastic as a coarse aggregate instead of the conventional aggregate to produce lightweight concrete. Also studying the effectiveness of adding polypropylene fibers for enhancing both concrete properties and shear strength of the reinforced concrete respectively in a flat slab. All specimens had the same dimensions and main flexural reinforcement ratio and they were subjected to concentrated vertical loads. Four mixes had been tested in this work, the results showed that using waste plastic mixed with polypropylene fibers to produce lightweight concrete was very promising. It was observed that by adding polypropylene fibers the failure pattern was shifted from punching to flexural. Ultimate load, crack pattern, and deflection had been included and discussed for all specimens. ?? 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.",

The main aim of this research was to examine the impact of alkali absorption and durability in the Carbon/Epoxy, Carbon/Vinylester, and Carbon/Isopolyester composites immersed in 13.59 pH alkaline solutions for a maximum of 25 days at 27??C (room temperature) and 65??C. Epoxy, vinyl-ester and Isoployester resin are selected as a matrix material and Poly-acrylonitrile-based Carbon fiber of 200 gsm fabrics is chosen as reinforcement and hand lay-up process is used for fabrication in the ratio of 35: 65 respectively and cured at room temperature with applied pressure using hydraulic press for 24 hrs. Solution of alkali was prepared and specimens were subjected to alkali solution. The moisture absorption was calculated on the basis of rate of moisture for every 5days interval and rate of diffusion coefficient (m2/sec) were calculated. Similarly durability studies (UTS, ILSS and FS) are conducted at 27??C and 65??C. Characterization of the fractured area was done using a scanning microscope. The obtained result rate of moisture absorption in case of neat casting and CFRP specimen shows the maximum alkali absorption in Iso-polyester / carbon whereas the minimum absorption was shown in vinyl ester/carbon specimens at RT and at 65??C over a period of 25days. At room temperature and 65??C the diffusion coefficient (D) was found and identified higher value for Iso-polyester/carbon and low for vinyl ester/carbon this is because Iso-polyester are distributed along the main chain, which makes easily available for reaction but in vinylesters the ester functional groups acts as a shield by methyl groups which restrict the easy absorption. Reduce in percentage in mechanical properties is due to Alkali absorption in terms of reduced degradation values in UTS, Flexural Strength and ILSS samples, carbon / epoxy showed supremacy over vinylester / carbon and iso-polyester / carbon. Scanning electron microscopy images show the embrittlement and micro-cracks on surface due to exposure to the alkali environments, matrix bonded to fiber are hardly identified as the temperature increases. ?? 2020 Author(s).",

The release of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a potential hazard associated with the environmental weathering of plastic debris. Artificial aging of reference polymers (polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, high and low density polyethylene) was performed in a Solar Box at 40 ??C and 750 W/m2. The volatile degradation products were determined before and after 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks of aging using a validated analytical procedure combining headspace (HS) with needle trap microextraction (NTME) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC?€?MS). A progressive increase in VOCs was observed during artificial photo-degradation, whose chemical profile resulted polymer-dependent and included carbonyls, lactones, esters, acids, alcohols, ethers, aromatics. The amount of extractable fraction in polar solvents generally showed a similar trend. The same analytical procedure was used to determine VOCs released from plastic debris collected at a marine beach. All samples released harmful compounds (e.g. acrolein, benzene, propanal, methyl vinyl ketone, and methyl propenyl ketone), supporting the initial hypothesis that microplastics represent an unrecognized source of environmental pollution. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Measurements of copper and zinc levels in the water and sediments were monitored over 468 and 435 days for the Panama and Mexico sites respectively. Additional chemical parameters were also measured including dissolved organic carbon in the water column and total solids, total organic carbon, total sulfides, redox potential and acid volatile sulfides and simultaneously extracted metals in the sediments. Measurements were taken at a reference site 1000 m away from the pens perpendicular to the dominant current direction, as well as 50 m upstream, 50 m downstream and adjacent to the pens. Muscle, skin and liver samples were taken from cobia (Rachycentron canadum) produced at the Panama site and analyzed for copper content. The dissolved copper levels at both farms stayed below 1 ??g/L at all times. There was no significant difference in the dissolved copper levels between the reference site and other measurement sites at either location. There was also no observable increase in dissolved copper levels over time at the Mexico location although there was a significant difference in dissolved copper levels between the sampling days at the Panama location. Zinc concentrations also remained within safe levels, never exceeding 0.82 ??g/L at any point. Copper and zinc levels in the sediments did not show a significant increase over time. The copper levels in tissue samples from the muscle tissue of the cobia raised in a brass mesh pen at the Panama site were 19% higher than those raised in the plastic mesh pen. The elevated copper levels are well below recommended daily intake levels and do not pose a risk to human health. There was no significant difference in copper levels of the skin or liver tissue samples. The absence of any increase in liver copper levels suggests that the fish's physiology and welfare are not impacted by brass mesh. The findings suggest that brass mesh is environmentally compatible with high energy marine environments and a commercially viable product for open ocean aquaculture farms. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Plastic debris released into the aquatic environment accumulates, with potentially detrimental effects on the lagoon ecosystem and pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera, a species of ecological, commercial and social value. Here, we tested the effects of leachates from new (N) and aged (A) plastic pearl-farming gear (spat collector and synthetic rope) obtained after 24 h and 120 h incubation, on the embryo-larval development of the pearl oyster using an in-vitro assay. Embryos were exposed for 24 h and 48 h to a negative control (0) and the leachate from 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 g of plastic. L-1. After 24 h exposure to leachate at 100 g.L-1, effects were observed on embryo development (-38% to -60% of formed larvae) and mortality (+72% to +82%). Chemical analyses of plastic gear indicated the presence of 26 compounds, consisting of organic contaminants (PAHs) and additives (mainly phthalates). Screening of leachates demonstrated that these compounds leach into the surrounding seawater with an additional detection of pesticides. Higher levels of phthalates were measured in leachates obtained from new (6.7-9.1 ??g.L-1) than from aged (0.4-0.5 ??g.L-1) plastics, which could be part of the explanation of the clear difference in toxicity observed after 48 h exposure at lower concentrations (0.1-10 g.L-1), associated with mortality ranging from 26 to 86% and 17-28%, respectively. Overall, this study suggests that plastic gear used in the pearl-farming industry releases significant amounts of hazardous chemicals over their lifetime, which may affect pearl oyster development that call for in-situ exploration.

However, there is relatively little evidence of the extent of MP pollution around remote islands, such as coral reefs, in the open ocean. In this study, we conducted a large-scale investigation of MP pollution in the surface waters around the remote uninhabited coral reefs of Nansha Islands in South China Sea. Microplastics were widespread in the surface waters with an average abundance of 0.0556 ?? 0.0355 items/m3, although this varied among the coral reefs. The MPs were predominantly composed of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE), and &gt; 70% of them were &lt;3 mm in size. Fragments and fibers comprised the most common MP types. The similarity between macro plastic and MP compositions provided evidence for the tracing of MP sources in the study area. The main pollutants (transparent PP fibers and PE fibers) around these remote coral reefs may originate from fishing gear abrasions. The plastic waste released from nearby residential islands and high-intensity fishing activities around Nansha Islands likely represented important local sources. Overall, the abundance of MPs found in the surface waters surrounding these remote coral reefs in the South China Sea was relatively low; however, these levels of MP pollution should not be disregarded given the importance of coral reef ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Nanoscale particles interaction with dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) significantly influence their behaviour and consequently bioavailability and toxicity to marine species. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are among the main components of the NOM pool in seawater yet have been so far little investigated for their effect in altering the physical-chemical properties of nanosized objects. Here we employed EPS from marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to study the evolution of an eco-corona formation upon incubation with 60 nm carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-COOH NPs), as proxy for nanoplastics in seawater. EPS significantly reduced PS-COOH NPs aggregation rate compared to biomolecule free natural seawater (NSW) and caused the formation of complexes constituted by both carbohydrate and protein components. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) revealed four main distinct groups of peaks, spanning from high (&gt;100 kDa) to low molecular weight (20 kDa) molecules, characterized by a high chemical heterogeneity. The lowering of the chromatographic signals detected after EPS incubation with PS-COOH NPs, mainly in the eluates at high molecular weight, suggests that an important fraction of EPS remained adsorbed on PS-COOH NPs. In agreement, SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins adsorbed on PS-COOH showed the occurrence of an eco-corona formed by proteins in the range of molecular weight 30?€?100 kDa. No toxicity to diatoms was observed upon PS-COOH exposure (72 h, 1?€?100 mg L???1) even by adding a further source of exogenous EPS during exposure. Moreover, the addition of EPS reduced ROS production, even when cells were incubated with PS-COOH NPs at 10 and 50 mg L???1, suggesting an antioxidant scavenging activity of EPS. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

In this study, forty-eight sediment samples were collected from three mangrove wetlands of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), South China to investigate the distribution of microplastic and discuss the possible relationship between HFRs and microplastic abundance in mangrove sediments. The abundance of microplastic in mangrove sediments from the PRE ranged from 100 to 7900 items??kg???1 dry weight (dw), with an average of 851 ?? 177 items??kg???1 dw, which was at a relatively higher level compared to other regions worldwide.

Polyethylene terephthalate) (PET) microfibers were added to 36 sediment chambers at six concentrations (0-0.5 g kg-1 sediment) to assess the effects on microphytobenthos (MPB), a key deposit-feeding bivalve, Macomona liliana, and sediment nutrient pools. MPB photosynthesis was promoted in 18 chambers through a 12 h light/dark cycle. Another 18 chambers were maintained under dark conditions to inhibit photosynthesis. After 35 days of MPB growth and stabilization, four M. liliana were added to each chamber for a further 40 days. MPB biomass and composition were examined alongside M. liliana biochemical and behavioral properties and porewater dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations. Increasing microfibers resulted in lower MPB biomass, fewer diatom-associated fatty acids (FAs), and an increase in cyanobacteria. The changes in MPB coincided with up to 75% lower energy reserves and reduced burrowing activity in M. liliana. In the light, nitrate + nitrate (NOx) was significantly elevated and related to M. liliana and MPB biochemical properties. Ammoniu (NH4+) concentrations increased but were variable in both the light and the dark. Our results suggest that increasing microfiber concentrations influence the interactions between M. liliana and MPB and affect biogeochemical processing in coastal marine sediments.

Among the various layered composites, fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) laminates have high strength and stiffness of its constituent fibers and low-density due to its matrix properties. FRP laminate consists of unidirectional plies that can be tailor-made to achieve desirable performance. The demand for layered composite materials has driven the need for development of efficient analytical tools for accurate prediction of its performance. The present paper provides an insight into the analysis of a laminate plate. The effect of the number of layers, aspect ratio and the stacking sequence on the transverse deformation of a laminate plate under bending is analyzed. It is observed that the transverse deflection of the plate decreases with an increase in the number of layers. Also, the increase in aspect ratio leads to an increase in the deformation of the plates. ?? 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The potential relationship between bisphenol concentrations and microplastic (MP) contamination of fish was also investigated. Fish from all the species had BPA in the liver and muscle, and bisphenol B (BPB) and bisphenol E (BPE) in the muscle. The highest concentration of BPA in the liver (302 ng/g dry weight - dw) was found in S. colias and the lowest one (5 ng/g dw) in T. trachurus. In the muscle, the bisphenol with the highest concentration was BPE in S. colias (272 ng/g dw). Fish with microplastics had significantly higher concentrations of bisphenols than fish where no microplastics were found, suggesting a relation between MP and bisphenol contamination in fish. In all species, the concentration of bisphenols was correlated with higher MP intake. Regarding human food safety, the estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ) and hazard index (HI) of bisphenols were higher than those established by the European Food Safety Authority suggesting hazardous risk for human consumers.

Reviewing the results of field and laboratory studies suggests that increasing the amount of non-plastic fine content in sand can lead to improvement or deterioration of liquefaction resistance. In this study, the effect of non-plastic silt on liquefaction resistance of Anzali sand is investigated using shaking table tests. According to the results, for the relative density of 30%, liquefaction resistance was found to be initially decreasing by increasing the silt content until the limiting fine content (LFC) as 15% and increasing thereafter. However, for the relative density of 60%, liquefaction resistance showed a continuously decreasing trend by increasing the silt content.

Molecular data from the plastid-encoded rbcL gene, combined with morphological and ultrastructural evidence, demonstrated that it belongs to the genus Rhodachlya and supports the proposal of a new species, R. westii. The new species was characterised by basal and erect uniseriate filaments, cells with parietal H-shaped or lobed plastids with one or two prominent pyrenoids, absence of unicellular hairs, and with monosporangia sessile or on branched stalks. Ultrastructure revealed pit plugs with two cap layers without a cap membrane, typical of Rhodachlyales. In our rbcL phylogeny, R. westii sp. nov. was recovered in a well-supported clade containing R. hawaiiana and R. madagascarensis (generitype) with interspecific divergence ranging from 5% to 10%, respectively. Characters previously used for species-level taxonomy (e.g. cell dimensions, number of pyrenoids and presence or absence of colourless hairs) are often plastic and overlap. We conclude that Rhodachlya species can be accurately identified only based on DNA sequence data and their geographic distribution. Rhodachlya westii becomes the third species of the genus, representing the first record in the Atlantic Ocean. Our data suggest that the genus is probably widely distributed.

Compression tests have been undertaken on a commercially-available Nomex core reinforced with tubes or rods at temperatures between 20 and 140 ??C. Tests were also undertaken on unreinforced Nomex cores in order to assess the benefits associated with localized reinforcement of the core. Compression tests on the unreinforced cores have shown that the strength decreased steadily with increasing temperature, passing from 4.8 MPa at room temperature to 3.8 MPa at 140 ??C. Similarly, the specific energy absorption (SEA) of the plain core samples decreased slightly from 22.3 to 18.9 kJ/kg over this range of temperatures. Reinforcing the cores with either rods or tubes had a positive effect on the compressive properties of the cores over the range of temperatures considered. For example, the room temperature compression strengths of the rod reinforced cores were 70% higher those of the plain core. Similarly, at 140??C, the rod-reinforced systems were 20% stronger than the plain core. Finally, the energy-absorbing capacity of the tube reinforced cores was higher than that of the rod-reinforced cores. ?? 2019 Japan Society for Composite Materials, Korean Society for Composite Materials and Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
TZS732DF,10.1080/1064119X.2019.1609632,Study on geotechnical characteristics of marine soil at Hong Kong?€?Zhuhai?€?Macao tunnel,"The Hong Kong?€?Zhuhai?€?Macao Bridge (HZMB) immersed tunnel is part of the HZMB, connecting three vibrant cities and crossing the Lingding Sea in South China. It is at the west channel of the Pearl River Estuary and the Tonggu West Channel. The stratum in this area includes deep soft soil with large differences in soil distribution. Based on geotechnical investigation data on marine soil at the HZMB tunnel, the spatial distribution of physical and mechanical properties of deposit soils was statistically analyzed. A field investigation revealed that deposit soils could be subdivided into four strata: Holocene marine deposit stratum, late Upper Pleistocene continental, mid Upper Pleistocene marine alluvial deposit, and early Upper Pleistocene alluvial deposit stratum. Field and laboratory test results indicate that Holocene marine deposit soils had a high water content (42.5% < (Formula presented.) < 81.2%), large void ratio (1.21 < (Formula presented.) < 2.43), flow-plastic state ((Formula presented.) > 1), high compressibility ((Formula presented.) < 5 MPa), low shear strength (2.5 kPa < (Formula presented.) < 28.5 kPa), and low bearing capacity (58.9 < (Formula presented.) < 120 kPa); therefore, they could not be used as a natural foundation. The late, mid, and early Upper Pleistocene continental deposit strata had low water content (1.5% < (Formula presented.) < 40.5%), high bearing capacity ((Formula presented.) > 120kPa), low void ratio (0.41 < (Formula presented.) < 1.24), and low flow-plastic to liquid state ((Formula presented.) < 0.95), Additionally, the results of regression analysis showed that the compression ratio was positively correlated with natural water content.

The influence of cement content, total water content, and curing period on the unconfined compressive strength of cemented clay are investigated. It is found that, at constant total water content, higher cement content results in higher unconfined compressive strength, while the total water content has an opposite effect. A power function can be used to correlate the unconfined compressive strength with the cement content or the total water content. For a fixed mix ratio, the unconfined compressive strength of cement-stabilized clay increases with the curing period, the effect of which can be characterized by a semi-log formula. Also, a strength-prediction model that considers both mix ratios and curing periods for cement-admixed marine clay is developed and validated; the model can capture the effect of clay type by considering the plastic index of untreated soils. It is also proved that the proposed framework for strength development is also applicable for other cement types. ?? 2019, ?? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

This region is home to some of the highest concentrations of zooplankton biomass but is also threatened by increasing shipping traffic from fishing and the growing tourism market. Samples were collected using a surface-towed neuston net during the Austral summer 2018, aboard the RRS James Clark Ross. Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry it was found that 45.6% of the plastic particles isolated from seawater samples were sampling contamination, originating predominantly from the ship. Of the remaining particles, both low density (polyethylene, polypropylene) and high-density (phenoxy and epoxy resins) polymers were found in the surface water suggesting both long-range and local sources of origin. Whilst we found that micro and mesoplastic concentrations in seawater were significantly low (0.013 ?? 0.005n/m3) compared to global averages, they were higher along the Antarctic Peninsula than the open ocean (Sub-Antarctic) stations. The potential availability of micro and mesoplastics (MP) to pelagic amphipods was explored, using an observed encounter rate (OER) and a possible encounter rate (PER). The total OER (0.8%) was higher than the PER (0.15%), suggesting that even at low concentrations, microplastics are encountered, and potentially consumed, by amphipods. This study highlights the need to prioritise regions of high zooplankton abundance and to investigate both water and biota to build up a picture of plastic pollution and its potential interaction with the Antarctic Ecosystem. ?? 2020 The Authors",

In this study, 100 L of surface seawater samples collected from 16 different stations of the South Yellow Sea in January, April, and August 2018 were analyzed to investigate the relationship between spatio-temporal distribution of microplastics and environment variables. Results showed that the abundance of microplastics in January (6.5 ?? 2.1 items/L) was higher than that in April (4.9 ?? 2.1 items/L) and August (4.5 ?? 1.8 items/L). On the whole, 78% of the total microplastics were <500 ??m, 90% were fibers, 73.2%?€?81.7% were transparent, and the two most abundant polymer types were polyethylene and polypropylene. The highest variability of microplastic characteristics (colour, size, and shape) and composition were observed in August, thereby showing the apparent features of terrestrial sources of microplastic pollution. Principal components analysis distinguished the spatio-temporal distribution of the microplastics, and significant difference in plastic sizes was found between microplastics in January and those in the other two months, which could be attributed to the Yellow Sea Warm Current and/or winter monsoon. Additionally, the abundance of microplastics, especially small-sized microplastics (<500 ??m), was positively correlated with seawater salinity. These results suggest that microplastic pollution in surface waters of the South Yellow Sea varies with seasons owing to differences in the terrestrial sources and marine hydrological dynamics. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Therefore, the main goal of this paper was to evaluate the abundance, composition, physical forms, and the possible sources of plastic debris in the El Quetzalito Beach. The area was intended for biodiversity conservation but has been excessively contaminated by plastic materials from land-based activities. The results state that plastic debris negatively impact the Caribbean coast of Guatemala and are released by storm water and riverine transport from the Motagua River. With a high abundance of 279 items/m2 (30 items/kg d.w.), composed mainly of polystyrene foam beads (66.8%) and polypropylene fragments (25.8%), the microplastic sources are the deterioration of large plastics.

In this study, the responses of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris to micro- and nanoplastics exposure were examined using long term toxicity test. The plastics tested were carboxyl-functionalized and non-functionalized polystyrene of 20, 50 and 500 nm in diameter. A reduction in algal cell viability and chlorophyll a concentration has been observed after exposure to the small sizes (20 and 50 nm) of plastics. Lactate dehydrogenase activity and reactive oxygen species concentration/production were significantly higher after exposure to the 20 nm nanoplastics than that of control confirming the stress condition.

In this work, the effect of in vivo exposure of Mytilus galloprovincialis to amino modified nanopolystyrene (PS?€?NH2) (10 ??g/L, 96 h) on hemolymph immune parameters and microbiota composition were investigated. Nanoplastics significantly affected immune parameters (decreased phagocytosis, increased ROS and lysozyme activity, inhibition of NO production). These changes were associated with a shift in hemolymph microbiota composition, with increase in some genera (Arcobacter-like, Psychrobium, Vibrio), and decreases in others (Shewanella, Mycoplasma). The results indicate that exposure to nanoplastics can impact on the microbiome of marine bivalves, and suggest that downregulation of immune defences induced by PS-NH2 may favour potentially pathogenic bacteria.

An action plan needs to establish to solve this marine pollutant. It requires multidisciplinary information, including the accumulation of data on microplastics in marine biota. The research of microplastic ingestion in the marine environment and organisms of Thailand is limited. As a result, this study was conducted to evaluate the accumulation of microplastics in marine fish from Thailand and to investigate whether the different foraging mechanisms of fish impact the occurrence of microplastics in their gastrointestinal tract. A total number of 361 demersal fish and 131 pelagic fish were investigated. The collected microplastics were counted according to their shape and color. Their polymer type was identified by FT-IR for the first time in fish from Thailand. Moreover, microplastics ingestion sorted by fish size was noted. The number of ingested microplastics in this study was relatively low compared to other locations. There was no significant difference in the number of microplastics ingested between demersal and pelagic fish (p = 0.132). Microplastic fibers were the dominant shape found in both demersal (82.76%) and pelagic fish (57.14%). The most common polymer type was polyamide in both demersal (55.17%) and pelagic fish (50.00%). The dominant microplastics color in both demersal and pelagic fish was red (31.03% and 28.57%, respectively). Microplastics ingestion along different fish sizes fluctuated.

MP can contain chemical additives and can also scavenge pollutants from the surrounding environment, and these co-contaminants may threaten the marine biota when MP become inadvertently ingested and transferred up the food chain. However, our understanding of the sorption-desorption kinetics of chemical compounds bound to MP remains limited. Moreover, whether MP are better transport vectors of co-contaminants than other natural particles (e.g. sediment) has not received much attention. Here, we used radiotracers to examine the partition coefficients (Kd) of three trace metals (109Cd, 134Cs, and 65Zn) to virgin MP (32?€?75 ??m polyethylene beads) and to natural sediment particles of a similar size (35?€?91 ??m) in seawater.

This investigation showed that polyethylene microparticles and nanoparticles have genetic, enzymatic and morphological effects on Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. An RT-PCR analysis showed increases in the expression of esterase and hydrolase genes at 5 days of exposure to polyethylene nanoparticles and at 10 days of exposure to polyethylene microparticles. A qualitative enzymatic assay also showed esterase activity in nanoparticle exposed samples. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy was used to assess morphological changes in exopolymer formation resulting from exposure to polyethylene microparticles and nanoparticles. The data from this paper suggests that microplastic and nanoplastics could be key microbial stressors and should be investigated in further detail. ?? 2020 Machado et al.

In emerging economies such as those in the Coral Triangle, the communities affected are among the poorest of their countries. To understand the consequences of ocean plastic pollution in coastal regions, through the eyes of local people, this study examines the knowledge, use, disposal and local consequences of single use plastics in remote island communities in two archipelagos of southern Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using mixed methods?€?a survey of plastic literacy and behaviour, household interviews about purchasing and disposal, and focus group discussions to generate shared mental models?€?we identify a complex set of factors contributing to extensive plastic leakage into the marine environment. The rising standard of living has allowed people in low resource, remote communities to buy more single-use plastic items than they could before. Meanwhile complex geography and minimal collection services make waste management a difficult issue, and leave the communities themselves to shoulder the impacts of the ocean plastic crisis. Although plastic literacy is low, there is little the coastal communities can do unless presented with better choice architecture both on the supply side and in disposal options. Our results suggest that for such coastal communities improved waste disposal is urgent. Responsible supply chains and non-plastic alternatives are needed. Producers and manufacturers can no longer focus only on low-cost packaged products, without taking responsibility for the outcomes. Without access to biodegradable, environmentally friendly products, and a circular plastic system, coastal communities and surrounding marine ecosystems will continue to be inundated in plastic waste. ?? 2020 Phelan et al.

EXBUCKHK,10.1371/journal.pone.0236579,Field and mesocosm methods to test biodegradable plastic film under marine conditions,"The pollution of the natural environment, especially the world's oceans, with conventional plastic is of major concern. Biodegradable plastics are an emerging market bringing along potential chances and risks. The fate of these materials in the environment and their possible effects on organisms and ecosystems has rarely been studied systematically and is not well understood. For the marine environment, reliable field test methods and standards for assessing and certifying biodegradation to bridge laboratory respirometric data are lacking. In this work we present newly developed field tests to assess the performance of (biodegradable) plastics under natural marine conditions. These methods were successfully applied and validated in three coastal habitats (eulittoral, benthic and pelagic) and two climate zones (Mediterranean Sea and tropical Southeast Asia). Additionally, a stand-alone mesocosm test system which integrated all three habitats in one technical system at 400-L scale independent from running seawater is presented as a methodological bridge. Films of polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer (PHA) and low density polyethylene (LD-PE) were used to validate the tests.

52L3JKA5,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114299,Weathering and persistence of plastic in the marine environment: Lessons from LEGO,"The residence times of plastics in the oceans are unknown, largely because of the durability of the material and the relatively short (decadal) period of time over which plastic products have been manufactured. In this study, classic LEGO bricks constructed of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and washed up on beaches of southwest England have been subjected to X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis and the spectra and any other identifiers matched with unweathered blocks stored in collections or sets of known history. Relative to unweathered equivalents, weathered blocks exhibit varying degrees of yellowing, fracturing and fouling, and are of lower mass, average stud height and mechanical strength. These effects are attributed to photo-oxidative degradation and the actions of physical stress and abrasion while exposed to the marine environment. Infrared spectra indicate that the polymer remains largely intact on weathering but with photo-degradation of the polybutadiene phase of ABS, while quantification of XRF spectra reveals that pigments like cadmium sulphoselenide become more heterogeneously distributed in the matrix when in the environment. Using measured mass loss of paired (weathered versus unweathered) equivalents and the age of blocks obtained from storage we estimate residence times of between about 100 and 1300 years for this type and thickness of plastic, with variations reflecting differences in precise additive composition and modes of weathering. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd The weathering and persistence of plastic at sea has been studied by comparing LEGO blocks washed up on beaches with archived LEGO blocks of a similar age. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The presence of MP was examined in the gastrointestinal content of 30 filter feeders of the herring Opisthonema complex (Clupeiformes: Clupeidae) from the Central Pacific of Costa Rica. MP were detected in 100% of the individuals with an average of 36.7 pieces per fish, of which 79.5% were fibers and 20.5% particles. No direct association between biometric variables or sex and the amount of microplastic was found. Different physicochemical analyses were carried out to determine the composition and characteristics of the microplastics. Most of the fibers were classified as polypropylene. Remarkably, some plastic particles turned out to be composed exclusively of minerals. This study demonstrates the high presence of MP in planktivorous fishes of the Pacific coast of Central America. Also, we propose the Opisthonema complex as a model for biomonitoring microplastic pollution in the Tropical Eastern Pacific due to its wide distribution, biometric homogeneity of the schools, non-selective feeding type, and its crucial position in the marine food webs. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Rivers are a major source, carrying plastic litter into the oceans. Microplastic sampling in riverine and coastal environments is often a challenging task due to limited access, time taken, costs, human resources, etc. Our present study evaluated the performance of newly developed sampling devices (Albatross Mark 5 and 6 (AM-5 and AM-6) that were suitable to collect floating and suspended microplastic samples in challenging freshwater and coastal environments (95 locations). Our observations indicated a similar magnitude of microplastic concentrations with AM-5 and AM-6 sampling compared to conventional plankton nets. The sampling duration, originally 10-60 min (by plankton net), was reduced to 3 min (AM-5 and AM-6) for sampling water volumes of approximately 10 m3. The developed AM-6 device was used to collect samples from riverine and coastal environments in Japan. The microplastic particle polymer composition (using Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FT-IR), size, and shape (microscopic images) were investigated. The observations showed a statistically significant particle size reduction from the riverine to coastal areas. The dominant polymer types detected were polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). The observations were complied with the coastal microplastic observations that were reported for previous studies in Japanese water environments. ?? 2020 by the authors.",
B6KN9VAU,10.1071/MF19177,Early evidence of microplastics on seagrass and macroalgae,"Microplastic accumulation on marine macrophytes, such as macroalgae and seagrasses, is a potentially critical but overlooked pathway by which microplastics enter the marine food web. Despite the possible significance of this pathway, few studies have examined the presence of microplastics on macrophytes found in situ. We quantified the density of microplastics found on the surfaces of three species of intertidal seagrasses (Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata and Thalassia hemprichii) and two species of subtidal macroalgae (Padina sp. and Sargassum ilicifolium), and found significantly higher microplastic densities on seagrasses than on macroalgae. However, we found no relationships between microplastic density and epibiont cover in either seagrass or macroalgae.

JKMZBB66,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111262,Using photographs to record plastic in seabird nests,"The incidence of plastic in seabird nests can be used to track changes in the amounts of marine debris, but large sample sizes are needed for accurate estimates. Surveys of active nests cause disturbance to breeding birds, so we need an efficient way to sample nest plastics. Photographs of brown noddy Anous stolidus nests at Ducie Atoll, southeast Pacific Ocean, allowed rapid characterisation of plastic use with limited disturbance, and showed selection for blue-green items. Plastic was more prevalent in noddy nests at Ducie Atoll (97%) than at Inaccessible Island, South Atlantic Ocean (41%), despite lower debris densities at Ducie. Differences in nesting habitat and the resultant availability of natural nesting material drive this difference in plastic loads. Using photographs to record plastic in seabird nests reduces disturbance to breeding birds and might decrease the risk of missing cryptic debris items. Photographs also provide a permanent record of pollution levels. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Currently, it is known that these particles, less than 5 mm in diameter, can lead to problems for both ecosystems and human health due to the toxicity of their components. In spite of this, research on this topic has focused mainly on the oceans, leaving aside rivers, which are the main source of these pollutants to oceans. Additionally, information is limited to certain rivers in countries of the northern hemisphere where wastewater treatment plants can retain up to 80% of microplastics. In South America, microplastic pollution is practically unknown, and wastewater treatment in several areas is still limited. This study focused on quantifying the microplastics present in the upper basin of the Guayllabamba River, in the Tropical Andes, a biodiversity hotspot. This basin is where the capital city of Ecuador, Quito, is located. Less than 10% of the wastewater in Quito is treated and the rest is dumped to rivers without treatment. We performed a physical analysis of microplastics, by weight and by category of microplastic, in various sampling points before and after urban areas. We found microplastic pollution beginning in the headwaters of the basin, with significant increases in urban areas of the Metropolitan District of Quito. Values of suspended microplastics in rivers after urban areas were higher than those recorded in the literature. Plastic levels in sediment were also higher after urban areas. Microplastics were highly correlated with other water pollutants, showing the prevailing necessity of wastewater treatment plants, because all of this pollution is dumped into rivers that flow from 2800 m a.s.l. to highly diverse freshwater ecosystems and human populations located downstream that depend on these aquatic sources, and finally to the Pacific Ocean. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",

Main changes upon NP exposure were observed in galactolipids and triacylglycerol's at both growth phases affecting the thylakoids membrane structure and cellular energy reserve of diatoms. Particularly, exponential cultures exposed to high NP concentration showed an impairment of long chain fatty acids synthesis. Changes in pigment and lipid content of diatom?€? cells revealed that algae physiology is determinant in the way cells adjust their thylakoid membrane composition to cope with NP contamination stress.

Direct or indirect exposure to those particles leads to adverse effects on marine organisms. In the marine environment, plastic materials interact with other pollutants such as metals, thereby affecting the uptake levels of those pollutants in marine organisms. In the present study, the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum was exposed to polyethylene microbeads and mercury chloride in single, combined and incubated form at environmentally relative concentrations for one week in controlled laboratory conditions. The uptake and tissue distribution of both stressors as well as the vector role of microplastics on mercury uptake in the organisms were investigated. Filtration rates, biomarkers for immunomodulation and oxidative stress, and histological alterations were also evaluated. Microplastics were ingested by the clams, and translocated to the various tissues. However, contaminated microplastics displayed a negligible vector role in terms of mercury bioaccumulation in the clams. The single and interactive exposure of the stressors reduced the filtration rate in the clams. Both pollutants affected the immune system of the organisms. Histological alterations were determined in the gill and digestive gland tissues of the clams among the treatment groups, although oxidative stress biomarkers remained unchanged. This study suggests that the vector role of polyethylene microplastics in mercury uptake is negligible and reveals that the single and interactive one-week exposure of two pollutants induce toxicity in the manila clams. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Among them, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) stand out as POPs with dangerous levels in the aquatic environment. In this paper we have developed a methodology for studying the sorption and extraction process of twelve congeners of PBDE from four microplastics: polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS). We have proved that there is a dependence between the polymer composition and the solvent used for the extraction of the analytes. The extraction is function of the ability of the solvent to partially or totally dissolve the plastic that will allow the analyte to have a greater capacity to be released from the polymer structure. The solution of the polymer is achieved by making the free energy (??G, or Gibbs potential) of the system negative making the process occurs spontaneously, this will depend on the solubility parameter (???), specific of both, solvent and polymer. Therefore, this study helps to determine which methodology to be applied for the extraction of pollutants before the start of the analysis. This approach has been applied to microplastic samples collected in different locations in the four oceans and collected from the Barcelona World Race (BWR) 2014?€?2015 sailing race. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

This study investigates the occurrence, physical properties, polymer composition and surface morphology, and element composition of MPs present in food-grade salts produced from seawater and bore-well water in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu, Southeast coast of India. Fourteen different brands of sea salts and bore-well salts were collected from the salt manufacturing units. The mean abundance of microplastics was 35 ?? 15 to 72 ?? 40 items/kg in sea salt and 2 ?? 1 to 29 ?? 11 items/kg in bore-well salt. Four types of polymers viz. polyethylene (51.6%), polypropylene (25%), polyester (21.8%), and polyamide (1.6%) were found in salt. Polyethylene fibers of size ranging from 100 to 500 ??m were observed commonly. Being manufactured from seawater, sea salt had the highest quantities of different microplastic particles. The study reveals that people consume approximately 216 particles of MPs per year via sea salt and 48 items per year via bore-well salt if the average person has a daily salt intake of 5 g. The surface morphology of MPs as exhibited in the SEM-EDAX images obtained in the study revealed the different weathering features of MPs, such as pits, cracks, and particles adhering to the surface. The presence of the elements Fe, As, and Ni on the surfaces as identified by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy indicates that these elements exist in the environment as contaminants and have become associated with the MPs.

However, there is currently little knowledge about MP fate from land sources to marine waters. Traffic is estimated to be one of the largest sources of MP; hence, stormwater is expected to be an important transportation route of MP to marine waters. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the size and density of tyre wear particles in road run-off on their fate in the G??ta River in Sweden using hydrodynamic modelling. The model of the stretch of G??ta River, Sweden?€?s largest river, passing through Gothenburg (Sweden?€?s second largest city) and out to the sea, was set up using MIKE 3 FM software. Literature data were used to define the MP characteristics: concentrations in stormwater, prevalent particle sizes, density of MP commonly occurring in road run-off and settling velocities. Results show that higher concentrations of MP are found on the south side of the river, compared with the north side, due to higher annual average daily traffic loads along the south side of the river. The mixing processes in the river and the MP concentrations were generally influenced by the vertical water density gradient caused by saline water from the Kattegat strait. While most MP with higher density and larger size settle in the river, smaller MP with density close to 1.0 g/cm3 do not settle in the river and therefore reach the Kattegat strait and the marine environments.

Providing a suitable assessment of marine litter effects on marine life through bioindicator species is crucial to drive an effective waste management policy. However, to date no standardized tool has been developed to describe and monitor the impact of marine macro-litter on marine life within deep-water habitats. Modifying the protocol proposed to monitor macro-litter ingestion by the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta, we perform a preliminary investigation on the suitability of different elasmobranch species for monitoring macro-litter ingestion in deep-sea. A total of 122 specimens representing 7 elasmobranch species were collected and examined. External visual inspections documented no clear evidences of disease due to marine litter entanglement. A total of 7 ingested litter items were found in the stomach or in the esophagus of 6 specimens of 4 different species (frequency of occurrence = 4.9%), with a maximum number of 2 items per specimen. No litter items were found in the intestinal contents, as well as no evidence of gastrointestinal blockages due to litter items were detected. The low number of collected litter items suggests that the number of samples required is too large for a feasible monitoring program. Moreover, we observed that the anatomy of the intestinal spiral valve may represent an obstacle to the transit of macro-litter items, which could be spontaneously regurgitated as it happens in the selective elimination of undigested remains, such as bones and scales. Therefore, macro-litter retention time in the gastrointestinal tract of elasmobranchs could be brief and shorter than retention time of food. This may lead to an underestimation of macro-litter ingestion frequency by deep-water elasmobranchs.

Plastic production is increasing exponentially and causing an unprecedented growth of plastic pollution entering the marine environment. Hence, a thorough assessment of debris accumulation areas is required to address the longstanding question about where is all the missing plastic. Most research on marine debris sinks to date has focused on oceanic gyres, the water column, seabeds and wildlife. Relatively little has focused on the potential of coastal areas as debris sinks. To address this knowledge gap, the spatial distribution of debris from the waterline to the backshore was modelled from a continental-scale dataset of coastal debris distribution from 635 surveys across Australia. Results showed that the distribution of debris is significantly correlated with oceanic and atmospheric processes (i.e. onshore Stokes drift and wind), and coastal usage for recreational activities (i.e. regional population and distance to the nearest road). Debris density and size increased from the waterline to the backshore, indicating that the backshore area represents an important debris sink, especially for larger sized items. ?? 2020 The Author(s).

However, the colonization of microorganisms on mariculture-derived MPs and their effects on mariculture remain poorly understood. In this study, the MPs (fishing nets, foams and floats) and a natural substrate, within size ranges (1?€?4 mm), were then incubated for 21 days in Sungo Bay (China), and the composition and diversity of bacterial communities attached on all substrates were investigated. Results showed that bacterial communities on MPs mainly originated from their surrounding seawater and sediment, with an average contribution on total MPs adherent population of 47.91% and 37.33%, respectively. Principle coordinate analysis showed that community similarity between MPs and surrounding seawater decreased with exposure time. In addition, lower average bacterial community diversity and higher relative abundances of bacteria from the genera Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas and Alteromonas on MPs than those in their surrounding seawater and sediments indicated that MPs might enrich potential pathogens and bacteria related with carbohydrate metabolism. They are responsible for the significant differences in KEGG Orthology pathways (infectious disease and carbohydrate metabolism) between MPs and seawater. The KO pathway (Infectious Diseases) associated with MPs was also significantly higher than those with feathers in the nearshore area. MPs might be vectors for enrichment of potentially pathogenic Vibrio, and enhance the ecological risk of MPs to mariculture industry. Lower bacterial community diversity and higher relative abundances of bacteria from the genera Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas and Alteromonas on MPs than those in surrounding seawater and sediments indicated the selectively enrichment of potential pathogens and bacteria related with carbohydrate metabolism on MPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Microbiomes are generally referred to as plastic entities, able to adapt their composition and functionality in response to environmental change, with a possible impact on coral acclimatization to phenomena related to climate change, such as ocean acidification. Ocean sites characterized by natural gradients of pCO2 provide models for investigating the ability of marine organisms to acclimatize to decreasing seawater pH. Here we compared the microbiome of the temperate, shallow water, non-symbiotic solitary coral Astroides calycularis that naturally lives at a volcanic CO2 vent in Ischia Island (Naples, Italy), with that of corals living in non-acidified sites at the same island. Bacterial DNA associated with the different anatomic compartments (mucus, tissue and skeleton) of A. calycularis was differentially extracted and a total of 68 samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In terms of phylogenetic composition, the microbiomes associated with the different coral anatomic compartments were different from each other and from the microbial communities of the surrounding seawater. Of all the anatomic compartments, the mucus-associated microbiome differed the most between the control and acidified sites. The differences detected in the microbial communities associated to the three anatomic compartments included a general increase in subdominant bacterial groups, some of which are known to be involved in different stages of the nitrogen cycle, such as potential nitrogen fixing bacteria and bacteria able to degrade organic nitrogen. Our data therefore suggests a potential increase of nitrogen fixation and recycling in A. calycularis living close to the CO2 vent system. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

However, less information is available on the combined effects of these physical and chemical stressors that, in nature, occur simultaneously. Thus, this study contrasts the effects caused by the antimicrobial agent and plastic additive, Triclosan (TCS) in the related clams Ruditapes philippinarum (invasive) and Ruditapes decussatus (native) and evaluates if the impacts are influenced by combined temperature and pH modifications. Organisms were acclimated for 30 days at two conditions (control: 17 ??C; pH 8.1 and climate change scenario: 21 ??C, pH 7.7) in the absence of the drug (experimental period I) followed by a 7 days exposure under the same water physical parameters but either in absence (unexposed) or presence of TCS at 1 ??g/L (experimental period II). Biochemical responses covering metabolic, oxidative defences and damage-related biomarkers were contrasted in clams at the end of experimental period II. The overall picture showed a well-marked antioxidant activation and higher TCS bioaccumulation of the drug under the forecasted climate scenario despite a reduction on respiration rate and unaltered metabolism in the exposed clams. Since clams are highly consumed shellfish, the consequences for higher tissue bioaccumulation of anthropogenic chemicals to final consumers should be alerted not only at present conditions but more significantly under predicted climatic conditions for humans but also for other components of the marine trophic chain. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

The coverage is usually related to how effectively a network is monitored by the sensor. There are major problems in the ocean or marine region, especially in water pollution. Underwater pollution generally causes acidification, plastic residues, and toxins. Today, the determination of this pollution is carried out through a human surveillance monitoring process. Therefore, there is a need for an automatic and intelligent monitoring system to identify the formation of pollution. The proposed simulation model defines the intelligent sensor-based monitoring system that identifies and alarms the formation of underwater pollution.

This paper presents a baseline report on the abundance of microplastics across three tidal waterlines (high, drift and current) of the tropical Atlantic ecosystem. Microplastics (1 ?€? 5 mm) occurrence and distribution in epipsammic sediments of five beaches in Lagos, Nigeria (Gulf of Guinea) were assessed. The microplastics were extracted by density flotation using saturated solution of NaCl and the identification of polymer types was done by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, ATR-FTIR. Results showed significant variations in the population of MPs in the three tidal waterlines with the high and drift waterlines accounting for 58.83% and 41.16% of the total MPs, respectively while no MPs were detected in the current waterline sediment. Polyethylene, polystyrene and polypropylene were the most abundant polymers recorded. Fragments were predominantly detected and pre-production pellets formed only 5.27% of total microplastics. Polymer risk index calculations showed low to medium risk of the microplastics found and local hydrodynamic conditions such as Ocean surges and current intensity were observed to influence the distribution and dispersion of microplastics. Continuous monitoring of MPs abundance is necessary to minimize the polymers?€? risk to the ecosystem. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

For opportunistic species, like many birds, urban waste offers alternative food which in turn may lead to plastic ingestion with potential negative effects. We assessed the incidence of plastics and other marine debris in breeding Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) diet at nine colonies located along 2400 km of coastline from southern Buenos Aires to southern Chubut, Argentina, using regurgitated pellets (n = 2355) and chick stomach content samples (n = 588). Plastics were recorded at all colonies, and incidence varied between 0.0 and 16.2% in adult pellets and 0.0-12.5% in chick stomach content samples, depending on the colony, breeding stage and year. Contrary to our expectation, incidence of debris including plastics in Kelp Gull diet was relatively low despite its opportunistic feeding habits and widespread use of refuse dumps, even at colonies located close (<10 km) to these anthropogenic food subsidies.

The oceanic islands are one of the most affected places by this type of material. A significant case of plastic pollution occurs in the Galapagos Islands. The Galapagos Islands, located west of Ecuador, have one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. It is the home of unique species in the world, and since 1978 it has been considered as a Natural World Heritage. However, the Galapagos Islands are threatened by plastic pollution. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the cost of environmental damage generated by plastic waste in the Galapagos Islands. The non-market economic valuation approach was used to implement contingent valuation. It was determined that the Willingness to Pay of Ecuadorian families, to reduce plastic pollution, was between US$ 4.90 - US$ 14.51 per year, with a median of US$ 7.65. This estimated value can serve as a reference to demand compensation from those who are generating pollution.

Therefore, their presence in terrestrial food has not managed to attract much attention-despite the fact that in the future they may represent a serious environmental risk. Research conducted in Europe and the US has indicated the presence of MPs in tap water, bottled water, table salt, honey, beer and snails for human consumption. The presence of MPs in food has not yet been evaluated in Latin America. This work focused on evaluating two widely consumed beverages: milk and soft drinks. Furthermore, honey and beer samples were analyzed and compared to findings in the literature. All products were sourced in Ecuador. In order to determine correlations with the intensity of anthropogenic activity, samples of both industrially processed and craft products were studied. For the analysis, an improvement of previous techniques used to determine MPs in honey was applied. This technique uses microfiltration followed by degradation of organic matter with hydrogen peroxide-and finally, continuous rinsing with deionized water. Size ranges were established between 0.8-200 mm. The number of microplastics found was between 10 and 100 MPs/L, with an average of around 40 MPs/L. The sizes of the particles found in the study are in the range of 13.45 and 6742.48 ??m for the fibers, and between 2.48 and 247.54 ??m for the fragments. From the composition analysis carried out with FTIR, we were able to confirm the presence of 12% of microplastic. The results generally showed a greater presence of MPs compared to those registered in Europe, probably due to processing methods rather than environmental pollution. Regarding composition, the main microplastics found were polyethylene, polypropylene and polyacrylamide. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

About 3000 industries discharge their wastewater into the stream, affecting almost 19 million people who live along the river. Considering the perseverance and the prospective toxicity of microplastics (MPs), investigating their concentrations in this river is critical to help illustrate the exposure of the risks to the residents of the area and beyond. This study was focused on identifying the MPs concentrations in the water, sediment, and milkfish (Chanos chanos). A volume-reduce method by using manta trawl was used to take water samples. Sediment and milkfish samples were taken using a grab sampling method. Digestion of fish was using Fenton oxidation method according to weighted ratio (1:5) and H2O2 30% (w/v). The average MPs concentration in the river was 0.0574 ?? 0.025 particles/m3; in the seawater ponds 3.000 ?? 2.645 particles/L; and in the mixed-water ponds, where the water from the river and the sea were mixed, 0.666 ?? 0.577 particles/L. The average MPs concentration in the sediment of Citarum River was 16.666 ?? 0.577 particles/100 g; in the seawater ponds 13.335 ?? 1.527 particles/100 g; in the mixed-water ponds 11.665 ?? 0.577 particles/100 g; and in the seawater 3.335 ?? 0.331 particles/100 g. The average of MPs concentration in the gut and gills of milkfish in the seawater ponds was 2.666 ?? 2.333 particles/fish, and in the mixed-water ponds was 1.166 ?? 0.983 particles/fish. The average of MPs concentration in the milkfish tissues taken from the sea was 1.333 ?? 0.577 particles/fish; and for the ones taken from the mixed-water ponds, the concentration was 1.111 ?? 0.838 particles/fish. Using the Kruskal Wallis test to generate statistical analysis, there is a significant difference between the MPs concentrations in the water and sediment samples of Citarum River based on their locations (p value = 0.024 and 0.032 &lt; 0.05). The most dominant plastic polymers in the samples were polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). There is no correlation between the level of MPs concentrations in water and sediments and the level of MPs concentrations in milkfish.

Sampling was conducted in 2018?€?19 by placing nets over stormwater outlets during rain events.

Most plastic items were single-use packaging, but industrial pellets washed out of the industrial outlet during every rain event. Compared to a similar study conducted in 1996, the number of litter items decreased by 20% in the industrial and residential areas but tripled in the commercial/residential area. The proportion of plastics in the litter stream was broadly similar to 1996. We extrapolate that some 60?€?570 t of plastic are released from Cape Town stormwater outlets annually, which is orders of magnitude less than predicted by global models. It is nevertheless clear that stormwater outlets are a significant source of litter into the sea.

This study examines the current efforts on recycling of the waste by extended producer responsibility (EPR) in South Korea as well as other countries. Material flow analysis (MFA) was performed on plastic packaging by life cycle. Based on the results in this study, material footprint of common single use plastics (i.e., PET water bottles, plastic cups, plastic bags, and plastic containers and cutlery by food delivery) by consumption was estimated to be on average 11.8 kg or 638 disposable plastics per capita a year, resulting in 32.6 billion disposable plastics and 603,000 ton of waste for disposal in South Korea. Approximately, 3 million ton of plastic packaging waste from household waste streams in 2017 in South Korea was generated and treated by energy recovery with solid refuse fuels and heat recovery, incineration without energy recovery, material recycling, and landfilling. Material recycling and recovery rates of plastic packaging waste from households were relatively low at 13.5% and 50.5%, respectively. It was estimated that as much as 3.6 million ton of CO2eq was generated from 2.7 million ton of plastic waste by incineration in 2017. Approximately 6.6 million ton CO2eq could be avoided by material recycling.

However, estimates of both past and future development of waste and pollution are scarce. We apply compositional Bayesian regression to produce the first estimates of past and future (1965-2100) waste generation disaggregated by composition and treatment, along with resultant environmental impacts, for every country. We find that total wastes grow at declining speed with economic development, and that global waste generation has increased from 635 Mt in 1965 to 1999 Mt in 2015 and reaches 3539 Mt by 2050 (median values, middle-of-the-road scenario). From 2015 to 2050, the global share of organic waste declines from 47% to 39%, while all other waste type shares increase, especially paper. The share of waste treated in dumps declines from 28% to 18%, and more sustainable recycling, composting, and energy recovery treatments increase. Despite these increases, we estimate environmental loads to continue increasing in the future, although yearly plastic waste input into the oceans has reached a peak. Waste production does not appear to follow the environmental Kuznets curve, and current projections do not meet UN SDGs for waste reduction. Our study shows that a continuation of current trends and improvements is insufficient to reduce pressures on natural systems and achieve a circular economy. Relative to 2015, the amount of recycled waste would need to increase from 363 Mt to 740 Mt by 2030 to begin reducing unsustainable waste generation, compared to 519 Mt currently projected. ?? 2020 The Author(s).

However, they have a limited field in automotive or marine industries in which both the unit costs of the products and applicability to mass production are of primary concern. Therefore, out-of-autoclave (OoA) processed products having similar mechanical properties with autoclave cured ones have been extensively studied. In this study, infrared (IR) curing, an OoA curing method, was investigated. The aim of the study is to propose a reliable temperature control method for an IR CFRP curing oven. A methodology that provides the surface and through-thickness temperature distribution of IR cured epoxy matrix CFRP was introduced. Optimum ply number and the distance between the heat source and the material were determined. Material surface was separated into nine virtual regions and region-based thermal evaluations were made by means of the thermal camera images and thermocouple data. Temperature distribution through thickness was determined. When designing a robust IR thermoset CFRP curing process, one should consider the temperature distribution on the surface and through the thickness of the material. ?? The Author(s) 2020.",

Secure attachment to the substrata, by means of tube feet and spines, is essential for survival. Previous studies suggest that environmental variables (i.e. hydrodynamics, substrate) can influence the morphology and adhesive performance of tube feet. Catastrophic failure of tube feet occurs often due to strong hydrodynamic forces. The time and ability of amputated tube feet to return to pre-amputation adhesive performance, and the interaction with environmental factors are unknown. To assess the dynamics of adhesive performance and regeneration of tube feet, we 1) evaluated phenotypic plasticity of disc surface area of two urchin populations inhabiting sites with different lithologies (field - in-situ conditions) and, 2) assessed regeneration of their functionality (tube foot length, time of disc first appearance, disc surface area, and tenacity) after amputation (laboratory - ex-situ conditions). Results showed that in the field, tube feet are plastic in their phenotype: sea urchins from the two sites differed in their disc surface area. Plasticity was also observed in the laboratory, where urchins regenerate tube feet that are shorter in length and have smaller discs compared to pre-amputation measurements. Thus, sea urchin tube feet recovering from amputation events in the intertidal may differ in their initial morphology and in the recovery period after amputation. Moreover, tube feet that were never amputated also decreased their disc area, suggesting that plasticity occurs on tube feet of urchins maintained in laboratory conditions. In shallow temperate reef systems, urchins are ecosystem engineers that affect the abundance and distribution of many other organisms. The plastic nature of morphological and adhesive abilities of sea urchin tube feet influences their ability to survive and dominate wave-battered habitats. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

In this work, visible-light photocatalysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) MPs in aqueous medium using a mesoporous N-TiO2 coating is proposed as an alternative for fighting MP pollution. Spherical primary HDPE MPs were extracted from commercially available facial scrubs, while film-shaped secondary LDPE MPs were obtained from a plastic bag. For each plastic, two different sizes were tested. Degradation was measured by mass-loss and carbonyl-index (CI) calculation. The results obtained reveal that the photocatalytic degradation of HDPE and LDPE MPs using an N-TiO2 coating was affected by the size and shape of the MPs. Smaller MPs led to higher degradation, while film-shaped MPs led to lower degradation that was related to a poorly illuminated and oxygenated reaction medium. These results set the basis for further investigation on the on the design of more effective photocatalytic-reaction systems for decreasing MP inputs to the environment. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

It is expected that the number of affected marine species will rise as research on this topic increases. Deep learning shows a potential for solving complex problems without the need for a physical understanding of the underlying system, and hence offers an elegant solution. The application of convolutional neural networks for the identification of microparticles in different aquatic environment was demonstrated. The measurements were carried out in real-time using a Raspberry Pi, a digital microscopic camera, and neural network computation, hence demonstrating a portable and low-cost environmental aquatic sensor. Phyton programming language was used to encode the input in the raspberry pi which serve as the brain of the device. The network model is trained using 1000 datasets where 70% was designed for training and validation, and 30% was for testing. The deep learning approach produced a good performance with 97.65%-88.32%-84.00% training-validation-testing accuracy for the Convolutional Neural Network model. The actual field tests conducted, showed a high percentage accuracy (90%) on different aquatic environment when compared with laboratory tests using Ultraviolet Visible Spectroscopy. The average discharging time was 1.18 hour which denotes that the scanning device can be used for a long period of time. The program and platform of the scanning device were functional.

The role of the damage parameterization, the cornerstone of the MEB rheology, in the formation and collapse of ice arches and ice bridges in a narrow channel is investigated. Ice bridge simulations are compared with observations to derive constraints on the mechanical properties of landfast sea ice. Results show that the overall dynamical behavior documented in previous MEB models is reproduced in the FD implementation, such as the localization of the damage in space and time and the propagation of ice fractures in space at very short timescales. In the simulations, an ice arch is easily formed downstream of the channel, sustaining an ice bridge upstream. The ice bridge collapses under a critical surface forcing that depends on the material cohesion. Typical ice arch conditions observed in the Arctic are best simulated using a material cohesion in the range of 5-10 kN m-2. Upstream of the channel, fracture lines along which convergence (ridging) takes place are oriented at an angle that depends on the angle of internal friction. Their orientation, however, deviates from the Mohr-Coulomb theory. The damage parameterization is found to cause instabilities at large compressive stresses, which prevents the production of longer-term simulations required for the formation of stable ice arches upstream of the channel between these lines of fracture. Based on these results, we propose that the stress correction scheme used in the damage parameterization be modified to remove numerical instabilities. ?? 2020 Author(s).",
WIQXZQNU,10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2020.103509,Comparative study on metal/CFRP hybrid structures under static and dynamic loading,"This study aims to explore the crushing behavior of aluminum (AL) - carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) tubes with different hybrid configurations subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. First, a series of experimental tests are carried out to explore the crushing behaviors of hybrid tubes in comparison with the corresponding individual tubes made of single material. The experimental results indicate that the H-II hybrid tube, made of an outer aluminum circular tube and internally adhered CFRP layers, generates a unique deformation pattern; whose outer aluminum tube inverses externally and inner CFRP layers crush progressively. With these distinctive deformation features, the H-II hybrid tubes are considered to be ideal with superior crashworthiness and energy-absorbing capacity. It is also found that loading rate has little influence on deformation pattern of hybrid tubes and single material tubes, while energy-absorbing capacity of hybrid tubes and individual CFRP tubes under dynamic loading are substantially lower than those under quasi-static loading. Second, numerical simulations are performed for the H-II hybrid tubes to provide further insights into their underlying energy-absorbing mechanisms. It is found that the external inversion mode of the outer aluminum tube is the major energy-absorbing mechanism, in which the contribution of the outer aluminum tube to total energy absorption decreases with increase in thickness of CFRP layers. The internal energy of the externally inversed aluminum tube is considerably higher than internal energy of typical progressively-folded AL tube (sole aluminum tube). Third, a parametric study is further conducted, which indicates that with increasing aluminum wall thickness, the specific energy absorption (SEA) increases. Besides, it is found that varying fiber orientation of inner CFRP layers leads to no evident change in the deformation mode and SEA of the H-II hybrid tubes. When the interfacial strength in between aluminum and CFPR reaches a certain level, there is no evident increase in the total energy absorption with further increase of the interface strength, but the initial peak crushing force increases notably. These results are expected to deepen the understanding of crushing behavior of the H-II hybrid tubes, thereby providing guidance for the crashworthiness design. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Pollutants from varied sources cause harmful effects to the ecosystem. The major pollutants across marine and terrestrial regions are hydrocarbons, plastics, and dyes. Conventional methods for remediation have their own limitations and shortcomings to deal with these environmental pollutants. Bio-based remediation techniques using microbes have gained momentum in the recent past, primarily ascribed to their eco-friendly approach. The role of microbial enzymes in remediating the pollutants are well reported, and further exploration of microbial resources could lead to discovery of novel pollutant degrading enzymes (PDEs). Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies and metagenomics have provided the impetus to explore environmental microbes for potentially novel bioremediation enzymes. In this study, a tool, RemeDB, was developed for identifying bioremediation enzymes sequences from metagenomes. RemeDB aims at identifying hydrocarbon, dye, and plastic degrading enzymes from various metagenomic libraries. A sequence database consisting of >30,000 sequences proven to degrade the major pollutants was curated from various literature sources and this constituted the PDEs' database. Programs such as HMMER and RAPSearch were incorporated to scan across large metagenomic sequences libraries to identify PDEs.

N4ABPR2A,10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.105648,Geological investigation of the settlement behaviour of two highways in Lianyungang region,"In the past 20 years, more than ten highways are built in the Lianyungang region, Jiangsu province, China. Among them, two highways (Coastal Highway A, close to the coastline, and Lianyan Highway B, approximately 25 km from the coastline) are crucial to the local highway network. However, the settlements of these two highways are significantly different, despite the same building method and location in a region with similar sediment provenance and sedimentary environment. A higher settlement rate was observed for the highway constructed far from the coastline. To clarify the mechanism, a series of field and laboratory tests based on regional geological survey were conducted in this study. Test results showed that the sensitivity difference of the soil induced by the pore water salinity leaching is the main reason for those observations. With pore water salinity leaching, the water content and plastic limit of Lianyungang marine soft clays remained almost unchanged, whereas the liquid limit and plasticity index of the soft clay near highway B gradually decreased with an increase in the liquidity index. The increase in the liquidity index subsequently decreased the remoulded strength of the soils far from the coastline. Simultaneously, the natural strength remained approximately the same due to leaching, and this led to an increase in the sensitivity, suggesting a strong structure. During the filling construction, the construction load and deviatoric stress under the embankment may have destroyed the clay structure.

However, its effect can be strong, as revealed by a new type of experiment, briefly named the gap test. It consists of a simple modification of the standard three-point-bend test whose main idea is to use plastic pads with a near-perfect yield plateau to generate a constant crack-parallel compression and install the end supports with a gap that closes only when the pads yield. This way, the test beam transits from one statically determinate loading configuration to another, making evaluation unambiguous. For concrete, the gap test showed that moderate crack-parallel compressive stress can increase up to 1.8 times the Mode I (opening) fracture energy of concrete, and reduce it to almost zero on approach to the compressive stress limit. To model it, the fracture process zone must be characterized tensorially. We use computer simulations with crack-band microplane model, considering both in-plane and out-of-plane crack-parallel stresses for plain and fiber-reinforced concretes, and anisotropic shale. The results have broad implications for all quasibrittle materials, including shale, fiber composites, coarse ceramics, sea ice, foams, and fone. Except for negligible crack-parallel stress, the line crack models are shown to be inapplicable. Nevertheless, as an approximation ignoring stress tensor history, the crack-parallel stress effect may be introduced parametrically, by a formula. Finally we show that the standard tensorial strength models such as Drucker-Prager cannot reproduce these effects realistically. ?? 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

The dissociation of MHs near the wellbore wall during drilling in marine methane hydrate-bearing sediments (MHBS) significantly reduces the bearing capacity of the wellbore and increases the risk of wellbore instability. In this study, a new elastoplastic analytical solution for wellbore stability during drilling in MHBS is provided, taking into account the reduction in the stiffness and strength of the formation after the hydrates dissociate, the conduction/diffusion and convection of heat/ion transfer, and the partial coupling among the seepage, temperature, salt concentration and mechanical fields. An axisymmetric plane strain problem is simplified by diving the infinite region into several annular regions with different physical properties. The distribution of pore pressure at a specific time for this multi-region problem is first obtained by introducing an influence radius estimated by the common unsteady flow solution. Accordingly, the conduction/diffusion and convection effects on the temperature and salt concentration fields are provided for balanced, underbalanced and overbalanced drilling conditions, and the dissociated region is finally addressed through the hydrate phase equilibrium equation fitted by numerous experimental data. Then, the mechanical responses of the wellbore in an elastic-brittle-plastic formation are analytically analysed by employing unified strength theory, considering two principal stress orders and three plastic zone locations. The analytical solution agrees very well with the numerical results determined under the same assumptions, and the solutions of the influence radii of the pressure and temperature and distribution of the pressure and effective stress around the wellbore are consistent with the results from complex numerical simulations. A detailed parametric study is carried out to investigate the specific influence of the drilling fluid properties, the size of the dissociated region and the reduction in Young's modulus/cohesion due to hydrate dissociation on wellbore stability during drilling in MHBS. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

The water absorption (WA) upon immersion in sea water, mechanical behavior, and combustion enthalpy of green composites were examined. The WA mechanisms obeyed the Fickian diffusion. The computed diffusion coefficient (D), thermodynamic solubility (S), permeability (P), and orthotropic swelling were generally increased as a function of RH filler. The increment of tensile strength and modulus of composites were maximized up to 16% and 121%, respectively, which was achieved at 70 wt% RH filler. The theoretical prediction of tensile strength and Young?€?s modulus from micromechanical models for random oriented RH fiber/blend composites were compared with the experimental results. As the RH weight fraction increased, the combustion enthalpy decreased (by approximately 30?€?48%) and thereby the enhancing the fire retardancy of green composite. ?? The Author(s) 2019.",

A large-scale space truss girder substructure was assembled, and the full-scale static and dynamic tests were separately conducted. The girder's static behaviour was analysed using three-point bending test, and the girder shows satisfactory bending stiffness contributed by the structural form of space truss. To reveal the girder's dynamic properties, the output-only modal identification method was used. Some unfavorable dynamic properties such as low natural frequency and the torsion mode as the first order mode shape were observed, which is mainly caused by the unique material properties and structural form. Thereafter, a strategy of adding diagonal bracing at the bottom chord plane to improve dynamic performance was proposed. To accurately predicting the static and dynamic properties, the fine line elements (FLE) model simulating all components?€? stiffness of the truss member were built. The simple-link-system (SLS) model was used for comparison. Based on FLE model, parametric analysis was conducted to reveal influences of key parameters. Finally, an efficient design strategy was proposed for this novel hybrid system with combined use of SLS and FLE model. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Meanwhile, the super high temperature properties lead to its poor machinability and machined surface integrity. Good machinability and surface integrity of IN-718 have always been challenging topics in the field of mechanical machining. The machinability and surface integrity of IN-718 was reviewed in this paper. The influences of chemical elements, microstructure, cutting parameters, and cutting environments on machinability were discussed. Cutting force, specific energy, and tool wear were analyzed as the main factors of machinability evaluation index. The characteristics of machined surface integrity including surface morphology (such as surface defects and surface roughness), microstructure modifications (such as plastic deformation, grain size, and white layer) and mechanical properties (such as microhardness and residual stress) related to IN-718 were presented. The state-of-the-art of machining IN-718 showed that most current research focused on its poor machinability and surface integrity in the aspect of material characteristics. There is lack of research on machinability from the viewpoint of geometrical structure of the part to be machined. Therefore, it is important to further study the manufacturability (the difficulty of the process from material to part) of IN-718 components with complex geometrical surface and profiles to achieve shape control and precise design.

Apart from property damage, hurricanes can damage natural coastal communities and wash solid waste into coastal waters and wetlands. Our goal was to develop a rapid, synoptic survey method to evaluate what happens to the coasts of small islands after hurricanes. This study reports on the development of a hurricane rapid ecological assessment method (H-REA) that was carried out on small islands in collaboration with local communities. The H-REA focused on property damage, vegetation damage, flooding, coastal erosion, and solid waste accumulation in the coastal environment. The H-REA method was developed to evaluate the hurricane damage from Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and then applied to assess Hurricane Irma?€?s damage to both the built and natural environments in 2017. The H-REA proved to be an important tool for the rapid assessment of 2017 hurricane impacts on the southern Bahamian islands; results are shown for Great Exuma. The H-REA results highlighted the variability of damage across the islands as well as the value of coastal set-backs and protected coastal wetlands in reducing both property damage and the amount of solid waste, including plastics, entering the coastal oceans. A spatial database was established to visualize the patterns of building damage, flooding, and vegetation loss; the spatial database allows for the assessment of damage from successive hurricanes. ?? 2019, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.",
HPD76SMI,10.1016/j.gete.2018.12.002,Geomechanical responses during depressurization of hydrate-bearing sediment formation over a long methane gas production period,"The geomechanical behaviour of hydrate-bearing sediments during methane gas production is complex due to the spatial and temporal changes in stress, pore pressure, temperature, and phase change. In order to evaluate the geomechanical risks during methane gas production, it is necessary to understand the thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) responses in the production region that recovers methane gas from the hydrate-bearing sediments. In this study, a fully coupled THM numerical simulator code was used to examine the reservoir scale field behaviour observed during the gas production trial conducted at the Eastern Nankai Trough, Japan in March, 2013. Using the available field investigation data, history matching of the gas production test was conducted to evaluate the methane gas production process. The fully coupled model allowed examination of the mechanical response using the critical state based constitutive model proposed by Uchida et al. (2012). The model parameters were determined from the results of triaxial compression tests conducted on recovered core samples. Based on the reservoir scale simulation results, this paper investigated the mechanical responses of five selected elements at different locations in the hydrate gas production region. The mechanical responses of hydrate-bearing sediments at specific locations within the production region are related to their hydrate dissociation status, which typically can be divided into before, during and after stages of hydrate dissociation. The 260 days gas production simulation suggests an increase in effective stresses accompanied by shearing deformation, which makes the soil more plastic. Potential geomechanical risks (such as wellbore stability and formation compaction) associated with the observed changes in stress/strain were also identified. ?? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",
JSBCUTRZ,10.1016/j.marstruc.2020.102785,Behavior of circular concrete columns reinforced with hollow composite sections and GFRP bars,"Hollow concrete columns (HCCs) constitute a structurally efficient construction system for marine and offshore structures, including bridge piers and piles. Conventionally, HCCs reinforced with steel bars are vulnerable to corrosion and can lose functionality as a result, especially in harsh environments. Moreover, HCCs are subjected to brittle failure behavior by concrete crushing due to the absence of the concrete core. Therefore, this study investigated the use of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars as a solution for corrosion and the use of hollow composite-reinforced sections (HCRSs) to confine the inner concrete wall in HCCs. Furthermore, this study conducted an in-depth assessment of the effect of the reinforcement configuration and reinforcement ratio on the axial performance of HCCs. Eight HCCs with the same lateral-reinforcement configuration were prepared and tested under monotonic loading until failure. The column design included a column without any longitudinal reinforcement, one reinforced longitudinally with an HCRS, one reinforced longitudinally with GFRP bars, three reinforced with HCRSs and different amounts of GFRP bars (4, 6, and 8 bars), and three reinforced with HCRSs and different diameters of GFRP bars (13, 16, 19 mm). The test results show that longitudinal reinforcement?€?whether GFRP bars or HCRSs?€?significantly enhanced the strength and displacement capacities of the HCCs. Increasing the amount of GFRP bars was more effective than increasing the bar diameter in increasing the confined strength and the displacement capacity. The axial-load capacity of the GFRP/HCRS-reinforced HCCs could be accurately estimated by calculating the load contribution of the longitudinal reinforcement, considering the axial strain at the concrete peak strength. A new confinement model considering the combined effect of the longitudinal and transverse reinforcement in the lateral confinement process was also developed. ?? 2020",

However, understanding crushing behavior of tubal structures made of different materials for lateral impact loading from different directions is fairly limited, which restricts their further applications. This study aimed to investigate the oblique lateral crashworthy characteristics of thin-walled circular tubes with aluminum, glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials by experimental, numerical and analytical methods. Thin-walled tubes were considered to bear the combined lateral compression and shear loading radially through two parallel rigid platens from the oblique angles of 0??, 10??, 20?? and 30?? to the horizontal direction, respectively. The effects of loading angles on crushing process, failure modes and crashworthiness indicators were quantified. Similar deformation patterns of each type of the tubes can be observed under these different loading angles, where frictional shear was found to be of limited effect on the deformation mode. With increase in loading angle, initial crushing force decreased, also the energy absorption of GFRP tube decreased whilst those of aluminum and CFRP tubes increased as seen from a prolonged process in the energy absorption-displacement curve. The specific energy absorption (SEA) of the aluminum, GFRP and CFRP tubes ranged from 2.36 to 2.62 J/g, 1.1 to 0.88 J/g and 0.79?€?0.96 J/g, respectively; and their corresponding crushing force efficiencies (CFE) ranged from 1.18 to 1.49, 0.74 to 0.59 and 0.6 to 0.65, respectively. To further explore the crushing behavior, finite element models were established and validated against the experiments. Finally, an analytical model was derived to predict the crashworthiness of thin-walled tubes under oblique lateral crushing. The study is expected to provide insights and guide to design of crashworthy structures for oblique lateral loading. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Sardines are found internationally in many coastal environments and represent a potential sentinel species for monitoring and comparing marine plastic exposure rates. We conducted a pilot study, examining the rate of plastic ingestion in 27 commercially caught sardines (Sardinops sagax) from a low populated coastal region of Western Australia. A total of 251 potentially anthropogenic particles were extracted by chemical digestion of the gastrointestinal tract and classified visually. Fibres were the dominant type of material recovered (82.9%), with both yellow (39.8%) and black (32.7%) coloured particles commonly observed. A subset of 64 particles (25.5%), were subject to Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to identify polymer composition. This chemical characterisation identified seven plastic items (polypropylene, nylon and polyethylene) and a variety of cellulose-based material that was further examined and classified as natural or semi-synthetic. The mean plastic ingestion rate was 0.3 ?? 0.4 particles per fish, suggesting Western Australian sardines ingest relatively low concentrations of plastic when compared to international sardine populations examined using similar methodologies. Despite comparatively low concentrations, plastic and semi-synthetic material are still being ingested by sardines from a low populated coastal region demonstrating the ubiquitous nature of the marine debris problem. ??

Twines are typically made of synthetic polymer fibres, likely for increased durability and economic benefits relative to natural fibres. However, synthetic twines can contribute to oceanic plastic pollution if fragmented or lost at sea, whereas natural-fibre twines will biodegrade over time. We compared the seeding success of zygotes and germlings of the fucoid Phyllospora comosa among different twines varying in diameter and composition (nylon (1 mm & 3 mm), Kuralon (2 mm & 3 mm) and Algae Twine??? (1 mm) and hemp (1 mm) in three separate experiments (A, B & C). For experiments A and B (both six weeks duration), equal densities of P. comosa embryos were seeded directly onto twines wrapped tightly around 20-cm lengths of 50-mm diameter PVC pipe and cultured indoors in controlled conditions. For experiment C (three-months duration) equal sections of each twine were wrapped in a randomised order around replicate quadrats (50 cm ?? 50 cm) and cultured in large flow through outdoor tanks. Successful seeding of P. comosa zygotes occurred on all twines in all three experiments, but differences in length, percentage cover and densities varied among twine types across times, and between experiments. Germlings had reached 1-mm lengths by 9 weeks of age in Experiment A, but similar lengths were reached by 4 weeks in Experiment B. In Experiment C, germlings had attained 1.7 mm by 12 weeks on all twines except hemp. This study demonstrates that whilst 2-mm Kuralon twine generally performed well, a range of twine types may be suitable for seeding and subsequent hatchery growth of P. comosa embryos, including the natural twine, hemp. Farmers may thus effectively base their choice of seeding twine on the cost of material versus environmental trade-offs of using natural versus synthetic twines. However, performance of the different twines at sea remain to be tested in future studies. ?? 2020",

In this study, the cyclic performance of short corroded columns of RC strengthened with carbon FRP (CFRP) is investigated. Seven short RC columns were fabricated and tested under cyclic loading. Of them, six specimens were corroded and one was uncorroded. The parameters considered included the number of CFRP strengthening layers (zero, one, 1.5, and two) and the type of fine aggregate (river sand and sea sand). The hysteretic curves, failure modes, and load?€?strain relationships of the specimens were compared and are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the equation for calculating the shear resistance of FRP-strengthened short RC columns in Chinese code has been modified to predict the shear resistance of the corroded RC columns strengthened with CFRP. The results show the following: (1) The deformability and energy dissipation of the corroded specimens without CFRP strengthening were significantly lower than those of the uncorroded counterpart. (2) Through CFRP strengthening, these values were improved and were even higher than those of the uncorroded specimen. (3) The modified equation can predict the shear resistance of CFRP-strengthened specimens. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

8VIRCD89,10.3389/fenvs.2020.00092,Can Water Constituents Be Used as Proxy to Map Microplastic Dispersal Within Transitional and Coastal Waters?,"Due to high spatiotemporal variability of aquatic systems, relationships between microplastic sources and sinks are highly complex and transportation pathways yet to be understood. Field data acquisitions are a necessary component for monitoring of microplastic contamination but alone cannot capture such complex relationships. Remote sensing is a key technology for environmental monitoring through which extrapolation of spatially limited field data to larger areas can be obtained. In this field study we tested whether microplastic distribution follows the same transport pattern as water constituents depictable from satellite images, namely chlorophyll-a, suspended particulate matter, and colored dissolved organic matter, and discuss their applicability as proxies. As rivers are a major source for marine microplastic contamination, we sampled three example river systems: the lower courses and river mouths of the Trave and Elbe estuary in Germany and the Po delta in Italy. For a full quantitative analysis of microplastics (>300 ??m), ATR- and FPA-based ??FT-IR spectroscopy and NIR imaging spectroscopy were utilized. Comparing water constituents with in-situ data using regression analysis, neither a relationship for the Elbe estuary nor for the Po delta was found. Only for the Trave river, a positive relationship between microplastics and water constituents was present. Differences in hydrodynamic conditions and spatiotemporal dynamics of water constituents and microplastic emissions among the river systems are possible explanations for the contrary results. Based on our results no conclusions on other river systems and likewise different seasons can be drawn. For remote sensing algorithms of water constituents to be used as microplastic proxy an adaption for each system as well as for different seasons would thus be necessary. The lower detection limit of 300 ??m for microplastics could also have influenced relationships as microplastic abundance exponentially increases with decreasing size class. Further studies with improved sampling methods are necessary to assess our proposed method. ?? Copyright ?? 2020 Piehl, Atwood, Bochow, Imhof, Franke, Siegert and Laforsch.",

The time scale of rotation for a living organism is important in understanding an organism's feeding efficiency, mating, prey capture rate, etc. This time scale is also crucial for understanding the migration of non-living materials such as microplastics. Herein, we investigate the tumbling motion of mesoscale particles that resemble organisms of intermediate size, such as zooplankton that appear in the ocean. Using time-resolved measurements of the orientation of rigid inertial fibers in a turbulence-tank, we analyze the autocorrelation of their tumbling rate. The correlation time (??d) is well-predicted by Kolmogorov inertial-range scaling based on the fiber length (L) when the fiber inertia can be neglected. For inertial fibers, we propose a simple model considering fiber inertia (measured by a tumbling Stokes number) and a viscous torque which accurately predicts both the correlation time and the variance of the tumbling rate. Our measurements and the theoretical model provide a basic understanding of the rotational response of an intermediately sized organism to the surrounding turbulence in its non-active state. ??

For these qualities most of the Industries are using plastics without considering its hazardous nature to the Environment and human beings. Different Types of plastics such as polyethelyene of High and Low density, polypropylene and other polymers are widely used in our daily consumable things such as water bottles, cups, rappers of food, carriage bags, and single used containers.

The molecular biodiversity [large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene] of three plankton size-fractions (micro-, nano-, and picoplankton) from coastal waters of ice-influenced west Greenland was compared with fractions from ice-free northwest Iceland within their summer environmental context. Putative metabolic functions were determined by differentially expressed mRNA (metatranscriptomics) of the microplankton. Temperature and salinity variations were more closely correlated than inorganic macronutrients with metabolic functions and community composition. Temperature explained much of the community variance, approximately 20% among micro- and nanoplankton, whereas other environmental factors accounted for rather low fractional variance (<7%). Species of smaller cell-size were more evenly distributed (Pielou?€?s evenness index J) across regions, with a higher diversity and total abundance, and thereby indicating high plasticity. The metatranscriptomic profiles in these respective microeukaryotic communities revealed that diatoms were more plastic in their gene expression than dinoflagellates, but dinoflagellates had a more diverse, albeit homogeneously expressed, gene pool. This could be interpreted as expression of alternative lifestyle strategies, whereby the functionally more conservative diatoms fill their niches primarily through variable resource use, whereas dinoflagellates apparently differentiate their niches through more diverse lifestyles. Patterns of microeukaryotic diversity are thus primarily associated with differences in metabolic function and activity of diatom- versus dinoflagellate-dominated communities in Arctic and Subarctic waters during summer. ??

Here, we investigated the role of marine coastal vegetated habitats as sinks for macro (???5 mm) and microplastics (&lt;5 mm) through a comprehensive, multi-habitat approach. We assessed the occurrence, abundance and physical properties of macro and microplastics in the canopy and superficial sediment of two intertidal (seagrass Zostera noltei, saltmarsh Sporobolus maritimus) and two subtidal (mixed seagrass meadows of Cymodocea nodosa and Zostera marina, rhizophytic macroalga Caulerpa prolifera) habitats in the Ria Formosa lagoon (Portugal). Our results showed that coastal vegetated habitats trapped macro and microplastics in the sediment at variable degrees (1.3?€?17.3 macroplastics 100 m???2, and 18.2?€?35.2 microplastics kg??? 1). Macroplastics accumulated in all vegetated habitat but not in nearby unvegetated areas, yet only S. maritimus habitat presented a significant trapping effect. Microplastics occurred in the sediment of all vegetated and unvegetated areas with similar abundances and high variability. Microplastics, all of type fibre, were recorded on all canopies except for S. maritimus. Overall, the trapping capacity of microplastics in the sediment and on the canopy was higher for subtidal than for intertidal vegetated habitats. We conclude that generalizations in the trapping effect of coastal vegetated areas should be done with caution, since it may be highly variable and may depend on the plastic size, habitat and tidal position. Since these habitats support a high biodiversity, they should be included in assessments of plastic debris accumulation and impacts in coastal areas. Further research, including experimental studies, is needed to shed more light on the role of coastal vegetated habitats as plastic sinks. ?? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

The results showed that average abundance of microplastics in the surface sediments was 1674 ?? 526 items/kg dry weight, which represented a heavy level when compared with other sea areas, including coastal waters, estuaries, the open sea and other mariculture areas. Microplastics with a size of <0.5 mm were dominant throughout four seasons. The dominant shape of microplastics was granule in summer, autumn and winter, and film in spring, respectively. The most common color of microplastics was transparent. Polyethylene was the dominant polymer in summer, autumn, and winter, while polystyrene accounted for the largest proportion in spring. Approximately 57.72% of the microplastics in surface sediments originated from the plastic mariculture facilities, suggesting that mariculture makes a significant contribution to microplastic pollution in Sanggou Bay.

By contrast, Chlorella sp. L38 presented strong adaptive capacity to microplastics. The key active enzymes concentration variation and characterization (SEM and TEM) images also verified the toxic effect of tested microplastics on Chlorella sp.

Presence of the bubbles could degrade the undrained shear strength (su) of the soil, when the gas pressure ug is relatively high as compared with the effective stress in the saturated soil matrix. Meanwhile, the addition of bubbles may also increase su when the difference between ug and pore water pressure uw becomes smaller than the water entry value, causing partial water drainage from the saturated matrix into the bubbles (bubble flooding) during globally undrained shearing. A new constitutive model for describing the two competing effects on the stress-strain relationship of fine-grained gassy soil is proposed within the framework of critical state soil mechanics. The gassy soil is considered as a three-phase composite material with compressible cavities, which allows water entry from the saturated matrix. Bubble flooding is modelled by introducing an additional positive volumetric strain increment of the saturated clay matrix, which is dependent on the difference between pore gas and pore water pressure based on experimental observations. A modified hardening law based on that of the modified Cam clay model is employed, which in conjunction with the expression for bubble flooding, can describe both the detrimental and beneficial effects of gas bubbles on soil strength and plastic hardening in shear. Only two extra parameters in addition to those in the modified Cam clay model are used. It is shown that the key features of the stress-strain relationship of three fine-grained gassy soils can be reproduced satisfactorily. ?? 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
BDNP4SB4,10.1073/pnas.2005646117,New perspective of fracture mechanics inspired by gap test with crack-parallel compression,"The line crack models, including linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), cohesive crack model (CCM), and extended finite element method (XFEM), rest on the century-old hypothesis of constancy of materials' fracture energy. However, the type of fracture test presented here, named the gap test, reveals that, in concrete and probably all quasibrittle materials, including coarse-grained ceramics, rocks, stiff foams, fiber composites, wood, and sea ice, the effective mode I fracture energy depends strongly on the crack-parallel normal stress, in-plane or out-of-plane. This stress can double the fracture energy or reduce it to zero. Why hasn't this been detected earlier? Because the crack-parallel stress in all standard fracture specimens is negligible, and is, anyway, unaccountable by line crack models. To simulate this phenomenon by finite elements (FE), the fracture process zone must have a finite width, and must be characterized by a realistic tensorial softening damage model whose vectorial constitutive law captures oriented mesoscale frictional slip, microcrack opening, and splitting with microbuckling. This is best accomplished by the FE crack band model which, when coupled with microplane model M7, fits the test results satisfactorily. The lattice discrete particle model also works. However, the scalar stress-displacement softening law of CCM and tensorial models with a single-parameter damage law are inadequate. The experiment is proposed as a standard. It represents a simple modification of the three-point-bend test in which both the bending and crack-parallel compression are statically determinate. Finally, a perspective of various farreaching consequences and limitations of CCM, LEFM, and XFEM is discussed. ?? 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.",
3YKW3W7T,10.1186/s12983-020-00359-9,"Within-family plasticity of nervous system architecture in Syllidae (Annelida, Errantia)","Background: The ground pattern underlying the nervous system of the last common ancestor in annelids was long thought to be settled, consisting of a dorsal brain, circumoesophageal connectives and a subepithelial, ladder-like ventral nerve cord with segmental ganglia connected by paired connectives. With the advent of immunocytochemical stainings and confocal laser scanning microscopy, it becomes evident that its architecture is extremely diverse, which makes the reconstruction of a ground pattern in annelida challenging. Whereas the nervous systems of many different families has already been described, only very few studies looked at the diversity of nervous systems within such clades to give a closer estimate on how plastic the annelid nervous system really is. So far, little is known on syllid nervous system architecture, one of the largest and most diverse groups of marine annelids. Results: The position of the brain, the circumoesophageal connectives, the stomatogastric nervous system, the longitudinal nerves that traverse each segment and the innervation of appendages are relatively uniform within the clade. Both the number of connectives within the ventral nerve cord and the number of segmental nerves, which in earlier studies were used to infer phylogenetic relationships and to reconstruct an annelid ground pattern, are highly diverse and differ between genera or even within a given genus. Differences in the distribution of somata of the brain, the nuchal innervation and its associated cell bodies were found between Syllinae and Exogoninae and may be subfamily-specific. Conclusions: The nervous system morphology of syllids very likely depends on the taxon-specific ecological requirements. Thus, it is not surprising that in a clade, which occupies such diverse niches as the Annelida, we find similar patterns in phylogenetically widely separated species in similar niches and a high degree of modularity within a family. Only standardized protocols and staining methods can lead to comparable results, but so far different approaches have been taken to describe annelid nervous systems, making homologization of certain structures difficult. This study provides the first thorough description of the nervous system in the family Syllidae, allowing more detailed comparisons between annelid families in the future. ?? 2020 The Author(s).",

T3EUH2BN,10.1039/d0ay00566e,A real-time isothermal amplification based portable microfluidic system for simple and reliable detection of: Vibrio splendidus,"The spread of infectious diseases among aquaculture species has a serious impact on the aquaculture industry. Simple, specific and low-cost detection methods are urgently needed for early diagnosis and timely treatment, particularly for on-site identifying and tracking of pathogens. Vibrio splendidus (V. splendidus) is regarded as one of the main pathogenic bacteria causing skin ulcerative syndrome in cultured sea cucumbers, leading to massive mortality and severe economic losses. We herein present a microfluidic-based real-time fluorogenic loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) system for simple and reliable detection of V. splendidus. A LAMP primer set with six primers (arsB1) specifically targeting the arsB gene of V. splendidus was successfully designed and tested on the portable microfluidic system for the first time. Only a single step of sample loading using a pipette is required to fill an array of reaction wells (with 10 or 18 wells) in a disposable chip for multiplex detection. A dedicated plastic shell is then utilized to tightly seal the openings of the chip by buckling to prevent contamination and evaporation. Up to four chips (one sample per chip) can be held in the stand-alone and inexpensive microdevice simultaneously, enabling on-demand detection of multiple samples in a single run. Reproducible (relatively low intra-and inter-chip variability) and sensitive (as few as ???20 CFU, Colony-Forming Units, per reaction well) on-chip arsB1-LAMP assay was demonstrated by using diluted lysate of V. splendidus. A linear standard curve (R2 &gt; 0.98) was attained over the template concentration range of 5 ?? 103 to 5 ?? 106 CFU mL-1. V. splendidus can be detected in samples containing different bacteria, indicating the feasibility of the portable microfluidic LAMP system for parallel detection of multiple bacterial pathogens. The proposed on-chip LAMP assay is simple to operate, reliable for amplification, flexible in detection and cost-effective in instrumentation and testing, holding great potential for on-site rapid detection and routine monitoring of aquaculture pathogens. ?? 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

Test method under controlled laboratory conditions,"Pollution of the seas due to plastic litter is a rapidly growing environmental problem. Among several actions, legal and technological, undertaken to alleviate this problem, included are the control of single use conventional plastics and the replacement of conventional non-biodegradable plastics with innovative biodegradable-in-the-sea polymers, both aiming at the mitigation of marine litter accumulation. Laboratory tests have been used to characterize plastics regarding their biodegradation in various environments. Biodegradation of plastics depends on the inherent characteristics of the polymer and the particular marine habitat conditions. In the present work, the international standard test method ISO 19679 (2016) for determining the aerobic biodegradation of non-floating plastic materials in a seawater-sediment interface of the coastal marine zone under laboratory simulated conditions is evaluated. Modifications are proposed to improve the reliability of this test method in some aspects. Agitation of the seawater surface in the bioreactor was found to enhance the continuous availability of oxygen at the seawater-sediment interface, thus assuring aerobic biodegradation conditions throughout the test simulating real sublittoral conditions. Additional recommended improvements include the use of larger samples and supplementary nutrients to optimise biodegradation conditions. The laboratory measurements were validated by field experiments. The proposed modifications and refinements optimise the robustness and reliability of the test method for determining aerobic biodegradation of plastic materials in a simulated seawater-sediment interface of the coastal zone. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Most of the sampled microparticles were fibers (&gt;90%). The identification of polymer types and additives was performed by combining three spectroscopic techniques, namely Raman Microscopy, Fourier-Transform Infrared microspectroscopy (??FTIR) and Synchrotron Radiation ??FTIR (SR-FTIR). SR-FTIR confirmed the presence of poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibers, while RAMAN spectroscopy provided evidence of fibers containing industrial additives. Our results estimated an average concentration of 400 microparticles/m2 of rocks identified as anthropogenic litter, which included an estimation of 90 microplastics/m2 identified as polyester fibers; the rest are mostly natural fibers with evidence of anthropogenic origin. Taken together, the results proved the occurrence of anthropogenic pollutants in remote polar areas. Their probable origin is the long range atmospheric transport. ?? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

However, evaluating the environmental impacts that occur in all life cycle phases (production, distribution, use and end of life), glass is often the worst packaging alternative. In particular, this study applied the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to compare the environmental performance of the traditional single-use glass bottle for wine with four packaging alternatives (aseptic carton, bag-in-box, refillable glass bottle and multilayer PET bottle) for the Italian market. Primary data about wine packaging systems (weight, size and composition of all components of primary, secondary and tertiary packaging), mode of transport and distribution and disposal scenarios of each packaging system component were provided by the packaging companies, Italian wineries and Italian Packaging Consortia as well as obtained from published literature and technical documents. Life cycle impacts of the wine packaging systems considered were assessed with the ReCiPe 2016 H evaluation method, adopting both midpoint and endpoint approaches. The results obtained highlighted that the most environmentally sound alternative is the bag-in-box, which is slightly better than the aseptic carton. The greater sustainability of bag-in-box and aseptic cartons was essentially due to the composition of the containers, lower packaging weight relative incidence and greater palletizing efficiency. The analysis of alternative scenarios, obtained by the variation of the three sensitive parameters identified (weight of containers, wine distribution distance and packaging disposal scenario), showed that upon decreasing the distribution distance, the environmental performances of refillable glass bottles became comparable to those of aseptic cartons and bag-in-box. These results pointed out that glass bottle reuse in Italy is a convenient alternative only when considering the local market (i.e. for drinks distribution at distances less than 100 km). ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The purpose of this survey is to find out how beach orientation and beach exposure affect the type of marine debris that accumulates on the beach on the coast of Dullah Island. The survey results show that statistically, there is a very significant and positive correlation between island orientation and beach exposure with total accumulation of marine debris, but negatively and insignificantly correlated with accumulation of plastic debris, ie; the greater the beach exposure will accumulate total debris the sea but conversely the greater beach exposure causes light plastic debris to be swept from the beach by waves and tides.

JYJJTL9Z,10.1145/3396864.3399704,PENGUIN: Aquatic plastic pollution sensing using AUVs,"Underwater plastic pollution is a significant global concern, affecting everything from marine ecosystems to climate change and even human health. Currently, obtaining accurate information about aquatic plastic pollutants at high spatial and temporal resolution is difficult as existing methods are laborious (e.g., dive surveys), restricted to a subset of plastics (e.g., aerial imaging for floating debris), have limited resolution (e.g., beach surveys), or are unsuited for aquatic environments (e.g., wireless sensing or Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy). We propose PENGUIN, a work-in-progress AUV-based solution for identifying and classifying aquatic plastic pollutants. PENGUIN has been designed as the first system that can both recognize pollutants and classify them according to specifics of the material. We present the overall design of PENGUIN, introducing the different components of the architecture, and presenting current status of development. We also present results of plastic classification experiments using optical sensing, demonstrating that simple PPG sensors provide a low-cost and energy-efficient solution for classifying different plastics. Our solution can easily monitor larger underwater areas than what current techniques offer while at the same time capturing a wider range of pollutants. ?? 2020 ACM.",

To date, our understanding of the distribution and sources of microplastics in the Arctic is limited but growing. This study aims to advance our understanding of microplastics in the Arctic. Surface water, zooplankton, sediment, and snow samples were collected from Hudson Bay to north Baffin Bay onboard the CCGS Amundsen from July to August 2017. Samples were examined for microplastics, which were chemically identified via Raman spectroscopy for surface water and zooplankton and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for sediment. We found that 90% of surface water and zooplankton samples, and 85% of sediment samples, contained microplastics or other anthropogenic particles. Mean anthropogenic particle concentrations, which includes microplastics, were 0.22 ?? 0.23 (per litre) for surface water, 3.51 ?? 4.00 (per gram) for zooplankton, and 1.94 ?? 4.12 (per gram) for sediment. These concentrations were not related to the human populations upstream, suggesting that microplastic contamination in the Arctic is from long-range transport. Overall, this study highlights the presence of microplastics across the eastern Canadian Arctic, in multiple media, and offers evidence of long-range transport via ocean and atmospheric currents. Further research is needed to better understand sources, distribution, and effects to Arctic ecosystems. ?? 2020 Huntington et al.",

Plastic litter reaches beaches directly and indirectly through different pathways, due to both terrestrial and marine pressures. In this study, we assess and characterize meso and microplastic pollution on four Uruguayan oceanic beaches along a gradient of tourist use within a complex regional coastal marine system. In Punta del Diablo we found a total mean density of 106 items m???2 of different debris (pellets, fragments, and foams) with different polymeric compositions, and diverse persistent bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals (PAHs, PCBs, OCs, heavy metals). However, the trend of plastic debris densities along this gradient was not what was expected. Fabeiro, one of the sites furthest from the urban center, had the highest total mean density of plastics (292 items m???2) suggesting that marine influences (winds, currents, and beach orientation) have a preponderant role in the distribution of micro and mesoplastics. Meanwhile, the density in the urban site (Pueblo) was highest during summer (March, 201 items m???2), 200 times higher than the density observed in winter (July, 1 item m???2). Although this difference could be associated to the peak season (southern summer), the analysis of types of plastics (171 pellets m???2 vs. 8 cigarette butts m???2) suggested a predominance of marine inputs. Seasonal changes in the configuration of the beaches due to natural geomorphological dynamics imply alternating states (Source or Sink of debris) that also affect the final density of plastics in the system. The relative importance of both sources is highly variable throughout the year and understanding them may directly improve beach management and stranded coastal plastic litter cleaning. ?? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

MPs are those polymeric particles with at least one dimension <5 mm. MPs possess complex physicochemical properties that vary their mobility, bioavailability and toxicity toward organisms and interactions with their surrounding pollutants. Similar to nanomaterials and nanoparticles, accurate and reliable detection and measurement of MPs or nanoplastics and their characteristics are important to warrant a comprehensive understanding of their environmental and ecological impacts. This review elaborates the principles and applications of diverse analytical instruments or techniques for separation, characterization and quantification of MPs in the environment. The strength and weakness of different instrumental methods in separation, morphological, physical classification, chemical characterization and quantification for MPs are critically compared and analyzed. There is a demand for standardized experimental procedures and characterization analysis due to the complex transformation, cross-contamination and heterogeneous properties of MPs in size and chemical compositions. Moreover, this review highlights emerging and promising characterization techniques that may have been overlooked by research communities to study MPs. The future research efforts may need to develop and implement new analytical tools and combinations of hyphenated technologies to complement respective limitations of detection and yield reliable characterization information for MPs.

Chemical additives such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), which are added to plastics to improve their qualities, are in focus because they allegedly cause adverse effects on marine fauna. Here we analyse OPFR levels in the muscle of fin whales because, as a mysticete, this cetacean obtains its food by filter-feeding and is thus highly vulnerable to marine litter. Moreover, the fin whale performs long-range migrations from low-latitude areas in winter to high-latitude areas in summer, a trait that makes it a potentially good large-scale biomonitor of pollution. We also analyse OPFR levels in its main prey, the krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica, to assess transfer through diet. The samples analysed consisted of muscle tissue from 20 fin whales and whole-body homogenates of 10 krill samples, all collected off West Iceland. From the 19 OPFRs analysed, we detected 7 in the fin whale and 5 in the krill samples. Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), Isopropylated triphenyl phosphate (IPPP) and Triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) were the most abundant compounds found in both species. Mean ???OPFR concentration, expressed on a lipid weight basis, was 985 (SD = 2239) ng g???1 in fin whale muscle, and 949 (SD = 1090) ng g???1 in krill homogenates. These results constitute the first evidence of the presence of OPFRs in the tissues of fin whales.

Thus, this study investigated the occurrences and distributions of microplastics and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in sediment samples from the Qiantang River (QR) and Hangzhou Bay (HZ) and analyzed the correlation between microplastics and PCBs. A total of 15 sampling sites were selected, including eight from the QR (i.e., four in the Tonglu area and four in the Fuyang area), two from the Andong salt marsh (ASM; located in a hydrodynamic turning point of the HZ), and five from HZ. The mean microplastic abundance was highest in the QR, followed by HZ and ASM, with 0.23 ?? 0.06, 0.18 ?? 0.05, and 0.15 ?? 0.03 particles/g sediment, respectively. Cluster analysis demonstrated that fragments and fibers may have originated from domestic sewage inputs to the QR.

In this paper, tetracycline (TC) was selected as a typical antibiotic, and its adsorption behavior on the surface of diverse type and different sizes of microplastics was studied to explore their combined pollution in an aqueous solution. The results of isotherm fitting showed that the maximum adsorption capacity and coefficient of polyethylene (PE) were the largest, and the adsorption capacity of PE was the strongest among the three microplastics: polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). With increasing PE particle size, the maximum adsorption capacity and adsorption coefficient of TC showed a significant decreasing trend, with a slight fluctuation in the middle. The presence of Pb2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, and Zn2+ markedly enhanced the adsorption of TC to PE, and Cu2+ could reduce the adsorption of TC to PE. The presence of chloride ions did not affect the adsorption process, which indicated that the adsorption mechanism between TC and microplastics is mainly an ion exchange mechanism. These results showed that the surface properties of microplastics and the chemical properties of the aqueous solution played an important role in the adsorption of TC. This study provides important scientific guidance and a theoretical basis for the study of the interfacial behavior, migration and transformation of marine microplastics. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

However, the transportation mechanism and effect of aging process are poorly understood. This study systematically investigated the desorption mechanisms of pharmaceuticals from pristine and aged polystyrene (PS) MPs under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions of marine organisms. Results showed that the increased desorption in stomach mainly depended on the solubilization of pepsin to pharmaceuticals and the competition for sorption sites on MPs via ?€-?€ and hydrophobic interactions. However, high desorption in gut relied on the solubilization of intestinal components (i.e. bovine serum albumin (BSA) and bile salts (NaT)) and the competitive sorption of NaT since the enhanced solubility increased the partition of pharmaceuticals in aqueous phase. Aging process suppressed the desorption of pharmaceuticals because aging decreased hydrophobic and ?€-?€ interactions but increased electrostatic interaction between aged MPs and pharmaceuticals, which became less affected by gastrointestinal components. Risk assessment indicated that the MP-associated pharmaceuticals posed low risks to organisms, and warm-blooded organisms suffered relatively higher risks than cold-blooded ones. This study reveals important information to understand the ecological risks of co-existed MPs and pollutants in the environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

This paper aims to investigate the behaviour of CFRP-CFST subjected to combined compression-bending-torsion load. Quasi-static tests are conducted on 5 CFRP-CFST members and 3 reference bare CFSTs. The test parameters include the loading scenario (pure torsion, bending-torsion, and compression-bending-torsion), the axial load ratio and the layers of CFRP wrapping. Experimental results show that the CFRP-CFST members exhibit good energy dissipation capacity under pure torsion and compression-bending-torsion loads, while the applied axial force benefits the bearing capacity and the stiffness. However, ?€?pinch?€? effect is observed in the load-deformation hysteretic curves of CFRP-CFST under bending-torsion load. It indicates that the confinement provided by CFRP can significantly improve the column bearing capacity and ductility under torsion. When subjected to combined compression-bending-torsion, the CFRP wrapping can effectively improve the column ductility. The energy dissipation capacity increases with multiple CFRP layers. Eventually, the structural mechanism at the ultimate limit state is analyzed, with the calculation methods for the bearing capacities evaluated. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

YN97ITNB,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137603,The Travelling Particles: Investigating microplastics as possible transport vectors for multidrug resistant E. coli in the Weser estuary (Germany),"The prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in aquatic environments has been a long withstanding health concern, namely extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. Given increasing reports on microplastic (MP) pollution in these environments, it has become crucial to better understand the role of MP particles as transport vectors for such multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, an incubation experiment was designed where particles of both synthetic and natural material (HDPE, tyre wear, and wood) were sequentially incubated at multiple sites along a salinity gradient from the Lower Weser estuary (Germany) to the offshore island Helgoland (German Bight, North Sea). Following each incubation period, particle biofilms and water samples were assessed for ESBL-producing E. coli, first by the enrichment and detection of E. coli using Fluorocult?? LMX Broth followed by cultivation on CHROMAgar??? ESBL media to select for ESBL-producers. Results showed that general E. coli populations were present on the surfaces of wood particles across all sites but none were found to produce ESBLs. Additionally, neither HDPE nor tyre wear particles were found to harbour any E. coli. Conversely, ESBL-producing E. coli were present in surrounding waters from all sites, 64% of which conferred resistances against up to 3 other antibiotic groups, additional to the beta-lactam resistances intrinsic to ESBL-producers. This study provides a first look into the potential of MP to harbour and transport multidrug-resistant E. coli across different environments and the approach serves as an important precursor to further studies on other potentially harmful MP-colonizing species. ?? 2020",

Samples of Harpodon nehereus, Chirocentrus dorab, Sardinella albella, Rastrelliger kanagurta, Katsuwonus pelamis and Istiophorus platypterus were collected from Tuticorin, southeast coast of India. The MPs in seawater and the gastrointestinal tracts of fish were identified using Stereomicroscope and characterized by FTIR and SEM-EDAX analysis. The abundance of MPs varied from 3.1 ?? 2.3 to 23.7 ?? 4.2 items L???1 in water, from 0.11 ?? 0.06 to 3.64 ?? 1.7 items/individual, and from 0.0002 ?? 0.0001 to 0.2 ?? 0.03 items/g gut weight. The epipelagic fishes had higher levels of MP contamination than the mesopelagic ones. Most of the MPs identified were of blue color, of fiber type and with their size &lt;500 ??m. Polyethylene was the most commonly detected MP, followed by polyester and polyamide, and this fact could be attributed to the inflow of domestic sewage and to the intensive fisheries activities in the area. SEM-EDAX spectra revealed the weathered MP surfaces which could adsorb/leach inorganic elements (colorants and fillers) from/to the environment. We may conclude that the concentration of MPs in fishes is a function of the concentration of MPs in their environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

This research paper is to focus on coastal pollution with the objectives of identifying marine litter to relate with the land use in Kuala Perlis, Malaysia. Marine litter is collected at three points along the shoreline stretching 30 meters in length and 5 meters in width. Collected litter varied between categories and the highest amount was plastic weighing 53.15 kg/m2 followed by fabric, wood, glass, rubber and metal. Generally, there are significant relationship between land use and accumulation of marine debris. As there is a development in the area, the accumulation of marine debris increases, in contrast with the small amount of debris found in undeveloped or nonpopulated areas.

We consider their associated seismic responses and hydrocarbon accumulations and determine the relationships between fluid flow and hydrocarbon migration. From amplitude anomalies and geometrical morphology, we identify different focused fluid flow systems, such as mud diapirs/mud volcanoes, gas chimneys, pipes and fault-related flow systems. We observe that gas-bearing high-amplitude anomalous fields, low-amplitude chaotic reflections, and ""drop-down""reflections are distinguishing features. These systems are affected by tectonic movements and sedimentation and are closely related to deep, high-temperature and high-pressure plastic fluids. Further, our investigations show that focused fluid flow systems, which preferentially develop in the weak parts of the strata, as well as associated faults and fractures, often act as conduits for hydrocarbon migration and accumulation. Therefore, these systems should be given utmost attention during seismic exploration for hydrocarbons. ?? 2020 Society of Exploration Geophysicists and American Association of Petroleum Geologists.",
BR7KV5JM,10.1364/OE.393231,Quantum cascade laser-based reflectance spectroscopy: A robust approach for the classification of plastic type,"The identification of plastic type is important for environmental applications ranging from recycling to understanding the fate of plastics in marine, atmospheric, and terrestrial environments. Infrared reflectance spectroscopy is a powerful approach for plastics identification, requiring only optical access to a sample. The use of visible and near-infrared wavelengths for plastics identification are limiting as dark colored plastics absorb at these wavelengths, producing no reflectance spectra. The use of mid-infrared wavelengths instead enables dark plastics to be identified. Here we demonstrate the capability to utilize a pulsed, widely-tunable (5.59 - 7.41 ??m) mid-infrared quantum cascade laser, as the source for reflectance spectroscopy, for the rapid and robust identification of plastics. Through the application of linear discriminant analysis to the resulting spectral data set, we demonstrate that we can correctly classify five plastic types: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS), with a 97% accuracy rate. ?? 2020 Optical Society of America.",

Here, we show that thermohaline-driven currents, which build extensive seafloor sediment accumulations, can control the distribution of microplastics and create hotspots with the highest concentrations reported for any seafloor setting (190 pieces per 50 grams). Previous studies propose that microplastics are transported to the seafloor by vertical settling from surface accumulations; here, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution and ultimate fate of microplastics are strongly controlled by near-bed thermohaline currents (bottom currents). These currents are known to supply oxygen and nutrients to deep-sea benthos, suggesting that deep-sea biodiversity hotspots are also likely to be microplastic hotspots. ?? 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

To reduce the consumption by substituting or even replacing most of the petrochemicals with degradable and renewable materials is inevitable and urgent for a sustainable future. We report here a unique strategy to directly convert biomass DNA, at a large scale and with low cost, to diverse materials including gels, membranes, and plastics without breaking down DNA first into building blocks and without polymer syntheses. With excellent and sometimes unexpected, useful properties, we applied these biomass DNA materials for versatile applications for drug delivery, unusual adhesion, multifunctional composites, patterning, and everyday plastic objects. We also achieved cell-free protein production that had not been possible by petrochemical-based products. We expect our biomass DNA conversion approach to be adaptable to other biomass molecules including biomass proteins. We envision a promising and exciting era coming where biomass may replace petrochemicals for most if not all petro-based products. Copyright ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",
KEG479GJ,10.1021/acs.est.9b06400,The Colors of the Ocean Plastics,"Characterization of the color of the plastic is often included in studies on plastic pollution. However, the comparability and relevance of this information is limited by methodology or observer subjectivity. Based on the analysis of thousands of floating plastic fragments from a global collection, here we propose a systematic semiautomatic method to analyze colors by using a reference palette of 120 Pantone colors. The most abundant colors were white and transparent/translucent (47%), yellow and brown (26%), and blue-like (9%). The white color increased in the smallest pieces (<5 mm) and far from coastal sources (>500 km). Both fragmentation and discolouration of ocean plastics may occur because of longer exposure time to sunlight in nature. In addition, yellow items peaked at around 1 cm and brown colors at around 1 mm, supporting the notion that yellowing precedes tanning in the aging process, which is paralleled by fragmentation. Apart from the effects of the weathering, our results suggest a second-order modulation of the color distributions of marine microplastics by the selective action of visual predators. The present work provides methodological tools and a wide empirical background to further the interpretation and applicability of the color information on ocean plastics.

In order to take a first step toward the challenging development of protein and bacteria-repelling and cell-adhesion-promoting materials, polyamine and poly(amido amine) surface coatings with terminal amine groups and varying structure (dendrimer, oligomer, polymer) were immobilized on model surfaces via silane chemistry. Physicochemical analysis showed that all modifications are hydrophilic (contact angles <60??) and possess similar surface free energies (SFEs, ???46-54 mN/m), whereas their amine group densities and zeta potentials at physiological conditions (pH 7.4) varied greatly (-50 to +75 mV). In protein adsorption experiments with single proteins (human serum albumin (HSA) and lysozyme) as well as complex physiological fluids (fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human saliva), the amounts of adsorbed protein were found to correlate strongly with the zeta potential of the surface coatings. Both modifications based on linear polymers exhibited good protein repellency toward all proteins examined and are thus promising for testing in cell adhesion studies. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

Their mean concentrations varied between 76 and 295 items per kg dry sediment. Fibres and plastic fragments were the dominant microplastic types. Overall, no relationship was found between their concentrations and sediment characteristics. Fine sediments were not identified as microplastic pollution traps. The highest microplastic concentrations were recorded at some urban beaches indicating that population density and the level of coastal infrastructure development are important factors affecting microplastic pollution level on beaches. On the other hand, microplastic concentrations in national parks did not differ substantially from the other beaches. Our results suggest that sediment accumulation processes may exceed microplastic accumulation, and overcome the effect of tourism and/or urbanisation, highlighting the role of the beach hydrodynamic status in structuring beach microplastic pollution. ?? 2020 The Authors",

Nevertheless, the reeds mowed can be transported away from the waters following storm surges and can be deposited in large quantities along the sandy beaches. We carried out a stratified study in a Mediterranean sandy beach to test the hypothesis that Giant Reed wrack may act as a sink and barrier for plastic beach litter. We observed a large amount of plastic litter entrapped in the Arundo donax wrack (density of 0.868 items/m2), with a higher density when compared to both the inner and the shoreline belts. Density of litter is significantly higher considering the categories of meso- and micro-plastics. Organic macrophyte wrack is useful for dunal macrodetritivorous invertebrates and generally for fauna communities, which use this litter as refuge and trophic pabulum. Significant accumulations of organic wrack can mitigate coastal erosion; nevertheless, for its structural characteristics, Arundo wrack can also act as a barrier for litter towards the inner vegetated dunes, so entrapping a large amount of anthropogenic litter. In this regard, Arundo wrack can represent a sink habitat, first attracting (due to large availability of detritus with a relative high rate of decomposition) and then, entrapping many organisms in anthropogenic litter. We suggest that, once mechanically mowed, the land reclaimed agencies should periodically remove from the channel banks the Arundo donax reeds, impeding the accumulation of incoherent vegetated matter along the aquatic ecosystem banks. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

From microplastics collected in the beaches of Hong Kong, we revealed an abnormal type of fragment which has not been reported before. These fragments, composing about 6% of the microplastics (pellet, foam, bead, fragment) collected, were interestingly triangular in shape with at least two of the three sides being characteristically straight and resembling a cut made by compression. Objective observations have distinguished these ?€?trimmed triangular fragments?€? to those triangular fragments that were fractured randomly. By comparing with additional evidence, we proposed that these trimmed fragments were the daughter pieces of macrofaunal biting.

Plastic fragments finally into microplastic, which can be taken up, for example by plankton, and subsequently by the entire ocean food web. An approach to reduce plastic pollution constitutes the accelerated microplastic degradation in marine environments. TiO2 (anatase) is commonly used as an oxidative photocatalyst and well known to catalyze the degradation of organic compounds upon UV irradiation. In this study, a selective activation of TiO2 (anatase) particles encapsulated by Ca- or Sr-polyphosphate is presented. The TiO2 polyphosphate core-shell particles are envisaged as additives in plastic products. The highly concentrated cations from seawater, viz. Na+ and Mg2+, displace the Ca2+ or Sr2+ cations from the polyphosphate shell. As a result, the polyphosphate coating dissolves and thus the photocatalytically active TiO2 core is released. The stability of the TiO2 polyphosphate particles in potable water and the seawater activated disintegration of methylene blue, methyl methacrylate, terephtalic acid, and poly(vinyl alcohol) was shown. It has been demonstrated, that the sweetwater stable polyphosphate coating degrades in the presence of seawater, which could be monitored by the activation of the TiO2 (anatase) photocatalyst. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Here, we exploited high-resolution multispectral satellite observations over the Bay Islands and Gulf of Honduras, for the period 2014-2019, to investigate the capability of satellite sensors in detecting marine plastic debris. We verified findings with in situ data, recorded the spectral characteristics of floating plastic litter, and identified plastic debris trajectories and sources. The results showed that plastic debris originating from Guatemala's and Honduras' rivers (such as Motagua, Ulua, Cangrejal, Tinto and Aguan) ends up in the Caribbean Sea, mainly during the period of August to March, which includes the main rainfall season. The detected spatial trajectories indicated that floating plastic debris travels with an average speed of 6 km d-1, following primarily a southwest (SW) to northeast (NE) direction, driven by the prevailing sea surface currents. Based on several satellite observations, there is no indication of a specific accumulation point, since plastic debris is dispersed by the dynamic circulation in the broader region. Our findings provide evidence that satellite remote sensing is a valuable, cost-effective tool for monitoring the sources and pathways of plastic debris in marine ecosystems, and thus could eventually support management strategies in the global ocean. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

Microbial biofilms contained bacteria, cyanobacteria and algae as well as inorganic particles such as iron oxides. Regardless of biofilm thickness and biovolumes of different biofilm constituents, single polyethylene (PE) particles stayed buoyant, whereas the sinking velocity of single polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) particles did not change significantly compared to initial values. During exposition, a mixing event occurred, by which anoxic, iron-rich water from the hypolimnion was mixed with water from upper layers.

Numerous taxa are at risk from microplastics including commercially valuable bivalves as seafood, which are also disproportionately important as biogenic reef-forming species that enhance biodiversity such that they are commonly protected under conservation actions. As a sessile filter-feeding organism, bivalves are highly susceptible to microplastic ingestion but despite their socio-economic and ecological importance, no research has been undertaken to assess how a reef's structural arrangement might affect plastic ingestion. Here, using a series of flume experiments, we examined how change in spatial arrangement of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, interacts with different flow speeds to effect retention of microplastic over reef surfaces and ingestion risk by individual mussels. Our results show that clumped spatial arrangements reduce boundary layer velocities, and increase turbulence, boundary layer thickness and plastic retention over reef surfaces under faster flow conditions, increasing plastic ingestion by 3-fold. Our findings suggest that the structural arrangement and rugosity of natural reef structures may create natural sinks of anthropogenic pollution, and species like Mytilus that are also important species for human consumption, while disproportionately susceptible to microplastic pollution, may be useful bioindicators of microplastic pollution. ?? 2020 The Author(s).

The Arctic is, despite its remoteness, emerging as an area of no exception to this environmental issue. Arctic sea ice has previously been found to constitute a temporal sink of microplastics, but the potential release and subsequent fate of microplastics in the marine environment are yet unknown. Furthermore, the relative importance of local sources of microplastics in the Arctic marine environment is under discussion. In this study, the concentration and distribution of anthropogenic microparticles (AMPs, &lt;5 mm, including microplastics) have been investigated in marine waters and sea ice of Svalbard. Seawater samples throughout the water column and floating sea ice samples were collected along a transect originating in Rijpfjorden, reaching northwards to the sea ice-edge. Seawater samples were also collected along a transect extending westwards from head to mouth of Kongsfjorden. Samples were collected throughout the water column with stations positioned to enable detection of potential AMP emissions from the wastewater outlet in Ny-??lesund. Along both transects, environmental parameters were measured to explore potential correlations with AMP distribution. High concentrations of AMPs were detected in sea ice (158 ?? 155 AMPs L???1). Based on both AMP concentrations and characteristics, AMPs identified in seawater of the marginal ice zone are to a large extent likely released during the melting of sea ice. The release of AMPs during summer melting of sea ice was concomitantly taking place with the ice-edge bloom, suggesting increased bioavailability to Arctic marine biota. Concentrations of AMPs were up to an order of magnitude higher in Kongsfjorden (up to 48.0 AMPs L???1) than in Rijpfjorden (up to 7.4 AMPs L???1). The distribution and composition of AMPs in Kongsfjorden suggest the wastewater outlet in Ny-??lesund to be a likely source.

Therefore, they are intensively cultivated to meet the rising demand. Mariculture is a potential source of microplastics (MPs). However, as a potential source of microplastics, little is known regarding the MPs pollution in macroalgae of open sea macriculture. Here we investigated the MPs characteristics in macroalgae in three sections of Haizhou Bay, an important mariculture area in China, during Pyropia culture (Pyropia yezoensis) and non-culture periods (Ulva prolifera, Sargassum horneri, Cladophora sp., Undaria pinnatifida, Ulva pertusa). It was found that P. yezoensis during the culture period had higher MPs abundance (0.17 ?? 0.08 particles g???1fresh weight) than other macroalgae (0.12 ?? 0.09 particles g???1 fresh weight) during the non-culture period, particularly for the nearshore sections. There were more fiber MPs in P. yezoensis (90.43%) in culture period compared to macroalgae (84.46%) in non-culture period. Highly similar spectrum of plastics in culture gears and macroalgae was verified. Pyropia culture gears released about 1, 037 tons plastics into the environment annually and the MPs abundances in seawater during the culture and non-culture periods were 1.04 ?? 0.32 and 1.86 ?? 0.49 particles L???1, respectively. The gap of MPs abundance between the two periods can be attributed to the tremendous trapping by massive biomass of P. yezoensis during the culture period and the continuous plastic release during the non-culture period. This study indicates that culture gears of macroalgae could be an important MPs source and the MPs can be transferred to human by edible macroalgae, and meanwhile macroalgae may be ideal biomonitors for MPs pollution in seawater due to their unbiased trapping and immovability. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

By compiling a global dataset from 916 seawater samples collected in six ocean basins, we show that although synthetic polymers currently account for two-thirds of global fiber production, oceanic fibers are mainly composed of natural polymers. ??FT-IR characterization of ???2000 fibers revealed that only 8.2% of oceanic fibers are synthetic, with most being cellulosic (79.5%) or of animal origin (12.3%). The widespread occurrence of natural fibers throughout marine environments emphasizes the necessity of chemically identifying microfibers before classifying them as microplastics. Our results highlight a considerable mismatch between the global production of synthetic fibers and the current composition of marine fibers, a finding that clearly deserves further attention. ?? 2020 The Authors.",
4KYS59QI,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.110729,Spatial distribution of microplastic in the surface waters along the coast of Korea,"We examined the spatial distribution and local characteristics of microplastics (0.33?€?5 mm) in surface water from six semi-enclosed bays and two coastal waters in Korea. Surveys were conducted in July from 2015 to 2017 using a Manta trawl. The mean abundance of total microplastics ranged from 1.12?€?4.74 particles/m3 among sites; the microplastics were mostly expanded polystyrene (EPS), paint particles, fragments and fibers. The mean microplastic abundance (2.85 particles/m3) in urban areas was about 1.5 times higher than in rural areas (1.86 particles/m3) (p &lt; 0.05). EPS dominated at rural sites, while fragments, paint particles, and fibers were relatively more dominant in urban areas. The different types and quantities of microplastic particles indicated that the region-specific occurrence of microplastics is likely to be related to differences in human activities between urban and rural areas, even though fibers were distributed throughout the study area. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Similarly, we do not know how the presence of microplastics might impact the colonization of sea ice by ice algae. To estimate the ecological impact of microplastics for Polar ecosystems, it is essential to understand their behaviour during ice formation and possible interactions with organisms inhabiting sea ice. In this study we tested the interaction between the ice algae Fragillariopsis cylindrus and microplastic beads with and without sea ice present and, in a third experiment, during the process of ice formation. With sea ice present, we found significantly less algae cells in the ice when incubated together with microplastics compared to the incubation without microplastics. However, during ice formation, the presence of microplastics did not impact the colonisation of the ice by F. cylindrus cells. Further, we observed a strong correlation between salinity and the relative amount of beads in the water and ice. With increasing salinity of the water, the relative amount of beads in the water decreased significantly. At the same time, the relative amount of beads in the ice increased significantly with increasing ice salinity. Both processes were not influenced by the presence of F. cylindrus. Also, we found indications that the presence of algae can affect the amount of microplastic beads sticking to the container walls. This could indicate that EPS produced by ice algae plays a significant role in surface binding properties of microplastics. Overall, our results highlight that the interactions between algae and microplastics have an influence on the uptake of microplastics into sea ice with possible implications for the sea ice food web. ?? 2020",

8SCGI42G,10.1371/journal.pone.0228811,Environmental DNA from plastic and textile marine litter detects exotic and nuisance species nearby ports,"Marine debris is currently a significant source of environmental and economic problems. Floating litter can be employed by marine organisms as a surface to attach to and use as spreading vector. Human activities are promoting the expansion of potentially harmful species into novel ecosystems, endangering autochthonous communities. In this project, more than 1,000 litter items were collected and classified from five beaches eastwards the port of Gijon, in Asturias, Spain. Next generation sequencing was employed to study biofouling communities attached to items of different materials. A dominance of DNA from Florideophyceae, Dinophyceae and Arthropoda was found, and four non-indigenous species (NIS) were identified. Results showed a clear preference of Florideophyceae and Bryozoa to attach on textile surfaces versus plastic ones. Considering that these taxa contain several highly invasive species described to date, these data emphasize the potential of textile marine debris as a vector for dispersal of NIS. Moreover, the closest beaches to the port contained a more similar biota profile than the farther ones, confirming that both plastic and textile marine litter can be vectors for species dispersal from ports. ?? 2020 Ibabe et al.

Currently, little is known about the fate of most plastics entering the marine environment and their potential biodegradation rate and extent under anoxic conditions. In this work, biodegradation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) films by consortia enriched from marine samples (litter and water) was evaluated in anaerobic microcosms. After 7 months, three microcosms showed dense biofilms on plastic surfaces, gravimetric weight losses up to 11.7 ?? 0.6%, marked decreases in thermal stability and average molecular weight of the polymer, suggesting microbial attack towards polymer chains. After 24 months, further three consortia showed the same abilities. Microbial communities analyzed at month 24 included taxa closely related to those previously reported as halogenated organic compounds degraders. The study is the first report on PVC biodegradation by marine anaerobic microbes and provides insights on potential biodegradation of the plastic film introduced into the sea by native microbes. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In this work, polypropylene squares were deployed in a pond for 30 days for microplastic biofilms colonization and then were transported to indoor microcosms at an environmental relevant level to study their effects on N and P cycling. Results showed that microplastic biofilms could accelerate ammonia and nitrite oxidation as well as denitrification. Presence of microplastic biofilms accumulated P temporarily and increased alkaline phosphatase activities (APA) in the system. Later in the experiment, disintegration of matured biofilms released N and P into the water. Mass balance calculation suggested possible N input caused by biological nitrogen fixation. Our results demonstrated that microplastics associated biofilms have the ability to alter the N and P cycling processes in aquatic system. However, additional works are required to further quantify the extent of such impact. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

This work aims to identify the presence of microplastics in the stomach contents of three small pelagic species of the Central zone of the Atlantic, located between Cape Cantin (33??N) and Cape Boujdor (26??N): Scomber spp., Truchurus truchurus and Sardina pilchardus; Also, to map the spatial distribution of the investigated species. A total of 251 individuals were examined, composed by 118 Scomber spp, 82 Sardina pilchardus and 51 Trachurus trachurus. The characterization of microplastics ingested by those species was identified by FTIR. The results showed the presence of three polymers: Polyamide (PA), Acrylic (PC) and Polystyrene (PS), in 26% of the individuals studied. The presence of polymers was accumulated in Atlantic horse mackerel (Truchurus truchurus) with 30%, then in mackerels (Scomber spp.) with 27%, and European pilchardus (Sardina pilchardus) (9%). Fish containing microplastics in their stomachs are concentrated, mainly in the northern part of the study area.

Two anthropogenic stresses associated with marine pollution are the introduction of marine plastic and their associated chemicals (e.g., trace elements) which, when ingested, may cause harm to wildlife. Here we explore the relationship between plastic ingestion and trace element burden in the breast muscle of Short-tailed Shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris). We found no relationship between the amount of plastic ingested and trace element concentration in the birds' tissues. Though the mass and number of plastic items ingested by birds during 1969?€?2017 did not change significantly, trace element concentrations of some elements (Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr and Cd), appeared to have increased in birds sampled in 2017 compared to limited data from prior studies.

This study simulates marine avian gastric conditions in vitro to examine the bioaccessibility of authigenic metals (Fe, Mn) and trace metals (Co, Pb) that have been acquired by polyethylene microplastic pellets from their environment. Specifically, different categories of pellet were collected from beaches in Cornwall, southwest England, and exposed to an acidified saline solution of pepsin (pH ??? 2.5) at 40 ??C over a period of 168 h with extracted metal and residual metal (available to dilute aqua regia) analysed by ICP-MS. For Fe, Mn and Co, kinetic profiles consisted of a relatively rapid initial period of mobilisation followed by a more gradual approach to quasi-equilibrium, with data defined by a diffusion model and median rate constants ranging from about 0.0002 (??g L???1)???1 h???1 for Fe to about 7 (??g L???1)???1 h???1 for Co. Mobilisation of Pb was more complex, with evidence of secondary maxima and re-adsorption of the metal to the progressively modified pellet surface. At the end of the time-courses, maximum total concentrations were 38.9, 0.81, 0.014 and 0.10 ??g g???1 for Fe, Mn, Co and Pb, respectively, with maximum respective percentage bioaccessibilities of around 60, 80, 50 and 80. When compared with toxicity reference values for seabirds, the significance of metals acquired by microplastics from the environment and exposed to avian digestive conditions is deemed to be low, but studies of a wider range of plastics and metal associations (e.g. as additives) are required for a more comprehensive risk assessment. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Metals on microplastics that have been acquired from their environment are highly bioaccessible to seabirds but concentrations mobilised are not deemed significant. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Three simulations have been performed to mimic the evolution of ML with density lower, similar, or higher than seawater. In all cases a realistic distribution of ML sources was used. Our results show that the accumulation/dispersion areas of the floating and buoyancy neutral particles are practically the same, although the latter are distributed in the water column, 80% of them found in the photic layer (average depth of 35m). Regarding to the densest particles, they rapidly sink and reach the seafloor close to their source. The regions of higher temporal variability mostly coincide with the ML accumulation regions. Weak seasonal variability occurs at a sub-basin scale as a result of the particles redistribution induced by the seasonal variability of the current field. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
T8M9Z59C,10.3390/rs12122013,Remote sensing of sea surface artificial floating plastic targets with Sentinel-2 and unmanned aerial systems (plastic litter project 2019),"Remote sensing is a promising tool for the detection of floating marine plastics offering extensive area coverage and frequent observations. While floating plastics are reported in high concentrations in many places around the globe, no referencing dataset exists either for understanding the spectral behavior of floating plastics in a real environment, or for calibrating remote sensing algorithms and validating their results. To tackle this problem, we initiated the Plastic Litter Projects (PLPs), where large artificial plastic targets were constructed and deployed on the sea surface. The first such experiment was realised in the summer of 2018 (PLP2018) with three large targets of 10x10 m. Hereafter, we present the second Plastic Litter Project (PLP2019), where smaller 5x5 m targets were constructed to better simulate near-real conditions and examine the limitations of the detection with Sentinel-2 images. The smaller targets and the multiple acquisition dates allowed for several observations, with the targets being connected in a modular way to create different configurations of various sizes, material composition and coverage. A spectral signature for the PET (polyethylene terephthalate) targets was produced through modifying the U.S. Geological Survey PET signature using an inverse spectral unmixing calculation, and the resulting signature was used to perform a matched filtering processing on the Sentinel-2 images. The results provide evidence that under suitable conditions, pixels with a PET abundance fraction of at least as low as 25% can be successfully detected, while pinpointing several factors that significantly impact the detection capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, the 2018 and 2019 Plastic Litter Projects are to date the only large-scale field experiments on the remote detection of floating marine litter in a near-real environment and can be used as a reference for more extensive validation/calibration campaigns. ?? 2020 by the authors.",
3R9GE4FF,10.1423/97837,The power of PET water,"Today global arguments against plastic are receiving greater media exposure. The viral and dramatic images of a plastic island floating in the Pacific Ocean as well as of marine animals trapped by waste packaging or contaminated by microplastic particles are constantly displayed even beyond environmental activist circles. Nevertheless, plastic packaging remains all-pervading in most people's everyday lives. Indeed, it seems to reveal a very powerful socio-materiality that features the above-mentioned contradictory global scenario. This paper focuses on this ??power??, investigating how the intertwinement between an essential good and a versatile plastic device is translated into shared justifications. A pragmatic theoretical approach and a socio-material sensitivity lead this analysis to the topic of bottled water in order to examine the ways in which different actors consider the assemblage of PET bottles and mineral water as a valuable object. In particular, the article retraces the orders of worth (Boltanski, Th??venot 1991), values and normativities (Law, Singleton 2014) enacting the politics of a disposable object (Hawkins 2015). A ??situated?? methodology informed this research, collecting the different points of view (judgments, normative arguments, justifications, critiques, etc.) of those actors enacting the plastic bottle assemblage. In particular, interviews with key informants and document analysis were adopted to develop the empirical design. The chain of worth that legitimates bottled water was retraced, from production, through intermediation and logistics, retailing and consumption, to disposal/recycling. In the Conclusions paragraph, the research findings are discussed. A PET bottle represents a mobile, variable geometry and personal infrastructure. It disappears - just from the immediate distance of ordinary perception - once customer needs are met. This is only one example of how the worth of this moral object is enhanced within a contradictory world, where environmental urgencies are claimed by the same people who used to drink plastic bottled water. ?? 2020 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

Biofouling composition is determined by collecting samples from marine structures and vessels and analyzing them in laboratories. Alternatively, an approach of online sensing based on Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), which consists of analysis of the spectral emission from laser-induced plasma, can be considered for the elemental composition of biofouling. The study of marine biofouling using LIBS has not been attempted previously. In the present work, a laboratory-scale LIBS technique is used to analyze biofouling samples and its constituent common water-borne algae and bacterial species. First, LIBS database is created under controlled conditions for the selected biofilm constituent algae (Nitzschia sigma and Chaetoslorenzianus) and bacterial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, E.coli) species. LIBS spectra are also acquired for Biofilm samples grown on Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) and Stainless steel (SS) 316 L substrates suspended at a depth of 1 m in the tropical Indian Ocean. The studies are carried out for fouling growth period of 5, 10, 15 and 20 days in the intertidal region at a distance of 480 m from the shore. The study shows that the LIBS technique combined with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used for acquiring the spectra of biofouling species, its rapid classification and studying the growth characteristics.

RHCNFXHP,10.3390/TOXICS8020022,"'The plastic nile': First evidence of microplastic contamination in fish from the nile river (Cairo, Egypt)","The presence of microplastics (MPs) in the world's longest river, the Nile River, has yet to be reported. This small-scale study aimed to provide the first information about MPs in the Nile River by sampling the digestive tracts of two fish species, the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, n = 29) and catfish (Bagrus bayad, n = 14). Fish were purchased from local sellers in Cairo, and then their gastrointestinal tracts were dissected and examined for MPs. Over 75% of the fish sampled contained MPs in their digestive tract (MP prevalence of 75.9% and 78.6% for Nile tilapia and catfish, respectively). The most abundant MP type was fibers (65%), the next most abundant type was films (26.5%), and the remaining MPs were fragments. Polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) were all non-destructively identified by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A comparison with similar studies from marine and freshwater environments shows that this high level of MP ingestion is rarely found and that fish sampled from the Nile River in Cairo are potentially among the most in danger of consuming MPs worldwide. Further research needs to be conducted, but, in order to mitigate microplastic pollution in the Nile River, we must act now. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

A major victim of this menace is the marine environment. Plastic wastes generated on land find their way to water bodies where they cause detrimental effects such as flooding and poisoning of the animals in the marine ecosystem. The plastics in the marine environment, which are ingested in fish, are also deleterious to human health if such fish are consumed. Cancer is a major disease that emanates as a consequence. In order to find an effective way to manage these wastes and improve the sustainability of our environment, this study, therefore, explores various approaches to recycling plastic wastes into new products. The critical threat of the presence of plastic wastes in our marine environment is also presented. The limitation of the use of plastic waste for construction applications alongside the prospects is discussed. It is concluded that the use of plastic wastes for construction applications will improve the sustainability of the environment significantly, and also serve as a reliable source of materials for construction purposes. In addition, the use of recycled plastic wastes as a component in cementitious composites has been found to be the most beneficial as it can be used to replace all solid components of the composite.

However, there is a lack of research on freshwater environments, notably in sediment, China. Microplastics contamination in sediment of Lake Ulansuhai has been investigated in the study, and its concentration range was from 24 ?? 7 to 14 ?? 3 n/kg. Further, it exhibited a difference in spatial distribution with high content in the north zone of the lake far from the entrance of the drainage canal and it has a decreasing tendency with the flow from north to south in lake. Colored plastic particles acted as the dominated pollution type, and more than 79.69% of microplastics were smaller than 2 mm in size, existed as the form of fibers. FTIR results mirrored that the main types of microplastics were polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride. Results obtained from SEM/EDS showed that there were cracks, holes, and irregular curls on the surface of it, and these microplastics may provide attachment sites for other pollutants. The appearance of metallic elements such as Al, Ni, and Fe showed that microplastics and other pollutants in Lake Ulansuhai have a combined effect, which may aggravate the degree of pollution in the lake. Practitioner points: Microplastics were found in the sediment of Lake Ulansuhai with a spatial distribution characteristic. Abundance and morphological characteristics such as shape, color, and size have been analyzed in the paper.

As filter feeders, oysters (Crassostrea virginica) are especially vulnerable to MP pollution. In this study, we assessed MP pollution in water at oyster reefs along the Mississippi Gulf Coast when: (1) historic flooding of the Mississippi River caused the Bonnet Carr?? Spillway to remain open for a record period of time causing major freshwater intrusion to the area and deleterious impacts on the species and (2) the spillway was closed, and normal salinity conditions resumed. Microplastics ( 25 ??m-5 mm) were isolated using a single-pot method, preparing samples in the same vessel (Mason jars) used for their collection right up until the MPs were transferred onto filters for analyses. The MPs were quantified using Nile Red fluorescence detection and identified using laser direct infrared (LDIR) analysis. Concentrations ranged from 12 to 381 particles/L and tended to decrease at sites impacted by major freshwater intrusion. With the spillway open, average MP concentrations were positively correlated with salinity (r = 0.87, p = 0.05) for sites with three or more samples examined. However, the dilution effect on MP abundances was temporary, and oyster yields suffered from the extended periods of lower salinity. There were no significant changes in the relative distribution of MPs during freshwater intrusions; most of the MPs (>50%) were in the lower size fraction ( 25-90 ??m) and consisted mostly of fragments ( 84%), followed by fibers ( 11%) and beads ( 5%). The most prevalent plastic was polyester, followed by acrylates/polyurethanes, polyamide, polypropylene, polyethylene, and polyacetal. Overall, this work provides much-needed empirical data on the abundances, morphologies, and types of MPs that oysters are exposed to in the Mississippi Sound, although how much of these MPs are ingested and their impacts on the organisms deserves further scrutiny.

Of the 16 countries, 11 have instituted bans, one has a market-based instrument and rest (4) with no strategy. Bans carry hefty punishments (i.e., fines and prison sentences). However, there is limited consultation when drafting bans, no national campaigns, and limited notification (less than one year) between ban announcement and subsequent implementation. There are no provisions for re-useable alternatives. We recommend current and future policies to reduce SUPs should engage stakeholders, allow sufficient time between announcement and implementation where the policy should be widely publicised.

However, the global impact of microplastic on human health is by and large either unknown or neglected. By looking at the underlying biochemical mechanisms leading to the global health threat microplastic was discovered to carry persistent organic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), to marine life. The effect of microplastic-ingestion in the human body remains unfortunately somewhat elusive as of yet. For this reason, we screened for compounds binding to the human estrogen receptor ??

We applied next generation sequencing to analyze the differentially expressed genes in MCF-7 cells after treatment with Indpy and Pice. We found 8 upregulated genes: ABCC5, CCNG2, CYP1A1, DDIT4, IER3, RUNX2, STC2, and SLC7A5 and 14 downregulated genes: ADORA1, CEBPB, CELSR2, CTSD, CXCL12, KRT19, PGR, PKIB, RARA, RET, SEMA3B, SIAH2, TFAP2C, and XBP1 induced by both ligands and associated with ESR1-regulation. The altered gene expression may influence cell proliferation and metastasis, favoring cancer development with a poor response to therapy. In addition, we confirmed the binding of Indpy and Pice to ER?? using molecular docking and microscale thermophoresis. ER?? activation was measured with ESR1-overexpressing HEK293 (HEK-ESR1) cells and confirmed for Indpy. In conclusion, we showed an ESR1-mediated influence of the PAH compounds Indpy and Pice on the gene expression pattern of MCF-7 cells, possibly also promoting breast cancer development in patients. ?? 2020",

Commercial fishing is a crucial sector in Norway, generating 4000 tons of waste plastic annually from fishing gears and ropes. While recycling, landfilling, and incineration are the standard end-of-life management options, the recycling industry in the region is immature. The lack of recycling capacity and inadequate infrastructure results in exporting most of the recyclable fraction out of Norway for further processing. Although within the framework of CE, the transboundary export of waste for recycling misses the opportunity to create value out of waste within the region. Therefore, in the pursuit of CE strategies, it is essential to ensure regional sustainability. In this study, we assess the environmental, economic, and social impacts of landfilling, incinerating, and recycling of waste fishing gears in Norway. To represent the current state, we include two existing recycling scenarios for the assessment, namely, recycling (inland) and recycling (export). Based on qualitative and quantitative data from relevant stakeholders, we adapted multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to rank the end-of-life (EOL) alternatives through their ability to sustainably manage 4000 tons of waste plastics from fishing gears in Norway. The ranking and insights from stakeholder interaction were used to ascertain potential barriers in realizing principles of CE and to further recognize opportunities for establishing circular business models in the region. ?? 2020 The Authors",

The particles included biochar pyrolyzed at 400 ??C, multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT), nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) and polyethylene microplastic. In treatments without C. closterium, inhibition effect of the particles on degradation percentage of DBP (up to 15.7% decrement except 1.7% increment for 0.2% nZVI) increased with the increase of particle sorption ability to DBP and particle concentration in general. The results of 16s rDNA sequencing showed that C. closterium was probably the most abundant DBP-degrader, accounting for 20.0?€?49.3% of the total taxon read numbers. In treatments with C. closterium, inoculation of C. closterium increased the degradation percentage of DBP in all treatments with particle addition by 0.0?€?11.3%, which increased with the increase of chlorophyll a content in general but decreased with the increase of particle concentration from 0.2% to 2%. The increment was the highest for treatment with 0.2% nZVI addition due to its highest promotion effect on algal growth. In contrast, the increment was the lowest for treatments with MWNT addition due to its strong sorption to DBP and strong inhibition on the growth of C. closterium. Our findings suggested that the environmental particles could influence bioavailability of DBP by sorption and biomass of C. closterium, and thus degradation of DBP in sediments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Nevertheless, due to its recalcitrance against biological degradation and the presence of toxic additives, landfilled and carelessly disposed PE products have caused serious pollution in the natural environments. In this work, we aimed to investigate the growth characteristics of Microbulbifer hydrolyticus IRE-31 and its application in the biological degradation of low-density PE. The IRE-31 strain was isolated from marine pulp mill wastes rich in lignin which is a natural complex polymer containing also saturated carbon-carbon bonds like in PE. Following 30 days cultivation of the IRE-31 strain, the biodegradation of linear low-density PE particles was evidenced clearly by morphological changes of the polymer surface monitored by scanning electron microscopy and the formation of additional carbonyl groups in the polymer chains indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
X3WPTX7G,,Improving campaign performance using purpose marketing: Case study of run for the oceans,"The importance of purpose-driven marketing has risen to new heights in the last few years. At Runtastic we did not simply want to follow a trend, but rather to play a pivotal role in shaping what such marketing looked like and what level of impact it could have. Building on our past effort into our annual Run For The Oceans campaign, we aimed to give this campaign and its essential cause ?€? raising awareness of the marine plastic pollution crisis ?€? an unprecedented level of importance in terms of our purpose marketing efforts, striving to create an impact far greater than we ever imagined possible. This paper outlines where we began, what measures we took to increase our scale and reach and how the outcome exceeded our wildest expectations. It is a study of the degree to which purpose marketing and corporate social responsibility matter to consumers in this day and age and how user engagement can be greatly improved by recognising the value consumers/users place on such topics. ??

We provide a comparison among techniques to detect and map marine litter objects on an UAS-derived orthophoto of a sandy beach-dune system. Manual image screening technique allowed a detailed description of marine litter categories. Random forest classifier returned the best-automated detection rate (F-score 70%), while convolutional neural network performed slightly worse (F-score 60%) due to a higher number of false positive detections. We show that automatic methods allow faster and more frequent surveys, while still providing a reliable density map of the marine litter load. Image manual screening should be preferred when the characterization of marine litter type and material is required. Our analysis suggests that the use of UAS-derived orthophoto is appropriate to obtain a detailed geolocation of marine litter items, requires much less human effort and allows a wider area coverage. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
HMCGCUXE,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109462,Evidence for complex sources of persistent halogenated compounds in birds from the south China sea,"Persistent halogenated compounds (PHCs), including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), alternative brominated flame retardants (ABFRs), and dechlorane plus (DP), were analyzed in muscle of six bird species from the South China Sea. DDTs, with concentrations up to 19,000 ng/g lipid weight (lw), were the dominant contaminants contributing to 66?€?99% of PHCs in birds. Concentrations of PBDEs, ABFRs, and DP ranged from 1.1 to 130, 0.73?€?40, and 0.21?€?2.5 ng/g lw, respectively. Historically pollution of DDTs and flame retardants in surrounding Asian lands were the main sources for PHCs in birds. BDE 209 was the primary PBDE congener in all birds. 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE) and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) were the main ABFRs. Anti-DP and p,p?€?-DDE were the dominating compounds of DP and DDTs, respectively. Only concentrations of BDEs 153, 203, 196, and 207, p,p?€?-DDE, and p,p?€?-DDD showed significant and positive correlations with ??15N values in samples. The resident birds, red-footed booby (Sula sula), had much lower levels of p,p?€?-DDE and most of PBDEs than those in migratory birds from the South China Sea. Results of stable isotope ratios of carbon suggest the highly variable food items for the five migratory bird species. The abundance of DBDPE in red-footed booby might be related with the ingestion of plastic debris, which still warrants further verification. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",
3NIZDQJZ,10.2118/199886-PA,3D geomechanical evaluation of jetting operations for producing hydrate chimneys in the sea of Japan,"The common occurrence of massive methane hydrate in numerous gas-chimney structures, located in Joetsu Basin, Sea of Japan, has stimulated great interest in academia, industry, and national institutes to develop technologies that produce the potential energy resource. Unlike other deep methane-hydrate deposits in formations a few hundred meters below the seafloor (mBSF), the hydratechimney structures are at the seafloor or up to 100 mBSF; therefore, previously field-tested production methods such as depressurization are not applicable. In this work, we proposed a new potential production method of jetting from the openhole section of a wellbore to excavate the hydrate bearing. However, jetting will create large empty chambers below the seafloor and could possibly jeopardize the stability and safety of wellheads and the production facility on the seafloor. This paper presents a 3D geomechanical simulation study to evaluate the feasibility of the jetting method to produce methane from the hydrate chimneys in the Sea of Japan. In this work, we constructed three types of 3D geomechanical models to represent three shallow-methane-hydrate-inhabitation types (chunk, laminated, and dispersed) by using data from various sources. Dynamic numerical simulation using a 3D finite-element simulator was conducted to simulate the jetting process to excavate a 16-m-diameter chamber from the bottom of the borehole (approximately 100 mBSF) progressively up to the bottom of the conductor of the wellbore, approximately 10 mBSF. The numerical simulation shows that jetting is likely to be feasible because all simulation cases resulted in tolerable vertical displacement and equivalent plastic strain under ideal conditions [e.g., lateral homogeneous formation, constant chamber pressure (equal to formation pore pressure), and blowout-preventer (BOP) weight of 20 tons]. In these cases, the plastic zone only extends to a limited area (10-20 cm) from the sidewall. Additional complexities were considered in the numerical simulation to evaluate the operational risks during actual jetting operations, such as faulting, fluctuation of chamber pressure, and change of BOP weights. This numerical simulation evaluated potential risks related to jetting operations of hydrate chimneys in the Sea of Japan and provided critical information for the engineering design of the proposed field test of jetting operations to produce this valuable resource in the Sea of Japan.

Transformation of plastic wastes into high-value materials is the incentive for plastic recycling, end-of-life handling case for plastic bag wastes in practice quite limited. The plastic recycling waste for reuse saves energy compared with manufacturing virgin materials. Herein, we identified several synthetic methods to convert plastic waste and other industrial wastes into carbon material for supercapacitor. Different kinds of carbon materials, including nanofiber, nanotube, graphene, mesoporous carbon, etc., have been derived from plastic waste, and thus give a superior potential for transforming trash into a ?€?gold capacitor?€?. Finally, conclusions and future trends of high-voltage supercapacitors were made as well as the easy and mass production of high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors.

PNNCNYUA,10.1016/j.wasman.2020.05.013,Implementation of harmonized Extended Producer Responsibility strategies to incentivize recovery of single-use plastic packaging waste in Canada,"Millions of tonnes of virgin (primary) plastic are produced annually, while recoverable (secondary) plastic rapidly accumulates as waste in landfills and the environment. Single-use plastics (SUPs) have short lifespans, and most of this waste is generated by packaging from global food industries. Food packaging waste comprises approximately one-third (8 million tonnes) of all Canadian municipal solid waste, and only 20% is recovered for reuse or recycling. Extended producer responsibility (EPR) strategies leverage corporate resources to reduce SUP waste generated by consumers. Implementation of EPR strategies allows local jurisdictions to gain greater control over their waste streams. Although Canada has had a national EPR strategy since 2009, it is currently only implemented for packaging in five provinces (e.g., British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Qu??bec), and is currently under development in New Brunswick. In this short communication, a case example of EPR implementation in Nova Scotia is provided which highlights the potential economic benefits for municipalities ($14?€?17 M CAD in estimated savings), for improved solid waste management and for increasing recycling rates. Further, a regional EPR strategy is recommended for all Atlantic Canadian provinces (e.g., Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia) now that the Canadian federal government has announced a move towards zero plastic waste under the Ocean Plastics Charter. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
RWHYKRAQ,10.1111/gcb.15043,Plastic pollution in croplands threatens long-term food security,"Plastic pollution is a global concern given its prevalence in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Studies have been conducted on the distribution and impact of plastic pollution in marine ecosystems, but little is known on terrestrial ecosystems. Plastic mulch has been widely used to increase crop yields worldwide, yet the impact of plastic residues in cropland soils to soil health and crop production in the long term remained unclear. In this paper, using a global meta-analysis, we found that the use of plastic mulch can indeed increase crop yields on average by 25%?€?42% in the immediate season due to the increase of soil temperature (+8%) and moisture (+17%). However, the unabated accumulation of film residues in the field negatively impacts its physicochemical properties linked to healthy soil and threatens food production in the long term. It has multiple negative impacts on plant growth including crop yield (at the mean rate of ???3% for every additional 100 kg/ha of film residue), plant height (???2%) and root weight (???5%), and soil properties including soil water evaporation capacity (???2%), soil water infiltration rate (???8%), soil organic matter (???0.8%) and soil available phosphorus (???5%) based on meta-regression. Using a nationwide field survey of China, the largest user of plastic mulch worldwide, we found that plastic residue accumulation in cropland soils has reached 550,800 tonnes, with an estimated 6%?€?10% reduction in cotton yield in some polluted sites based on current level of plastic residue content. Immediate actions should be taken to ensure the recovery of plastic film mulch and limit further increase in film residue loading to maintain the sustainability of these croplands. ?? 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",

Electrochemical and scratch tests, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction studies were performed. Degradation of coatings in the marine atmosphere and seawater was evaluated. The composite polymer-containing coating provided better corrosion protection of aluminum alloy compared to the PEO-coating, although seawater affected both. During the atmospheric exposure, the PEO-coating provided reasonably good protection, and the composite coating showed excellent performance. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

Plastics have recently been discovered in deep ocean trenches-proving their capabilities of traveling into the Earth's inner layers. Of these plastics, polyethylene enjoys commercial popularity and widespread applications. We systematically study polyethylene at various pressures and temperatures to figure out its physical and chemical stability and further on its degradability, by performing first-principle calculations in the frame of the density functional theory. Results show that lattice constants and bond lengths decrease under high pressure applications, while marginal increases occur under high temperatures. The effect of the dopant H2 is also evaluated due to its abundance within the inner layers of the Earth. Our relaxation calculations show that H2 doped polyethylene exhibits greater decrease rates in structural parameters. The electronic structures of both the pure and doped polyethylene illustrate metallic transitions at pressures around 140 GPa, which is in good agreement with other theoretical studies. Throughout this paper, atomic and electronic structure changes under high pressures and temperatures are analyzed and discussed in more depth. We conclude that high pressure and temperature applications are potential factors that can be considered for future sustainable degradation methods. ?? 2020 Author(s).",
N9DX3ZDG,10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107020,Physical and mechanical properties of the overburden layer on gas hydrate-bearing sediments of the South China sea,"Gas hydrate exploitation may trigger the destruction of the overburden structure and settlement of the overburden layer on the gas hydrate-bearing sediments. It is extremely urgent to explore the basic laws governing the physical and mechanical properties of the overburden layers before performing commercial exploitations of hydrates. However, relatively few studies have focused on the physical and mechanical properties of the overburden layer (uppermost 10 m) on the gas hydrate-bearing sediments of the South China Sea. In this research, we studied the physical and mechanical properties of the overburden sediments from this area, including the particle size distribution, the specific surface area, the pore size distribution, the water content, the liquid/plastic limits, and the mineral and chemical compositions of the particles, as well as the strength and deformation characteristics. According to the results, we found that the overburden sediments of the Shenhu area are characterized as well-graded clayey silts and considered to be internally stable and self-filtering. The isothermal adsorption-desorption curve is a Type H3 hysteretic loop, indicating that the shape of the particles occurs primarily in a plate form, and most of the pores are slit-shaped. The plasticity index in this area is relatively lower than that in other areas, which suggests that there is a risk of overburden collapse during the production process of hydrates. The mineral composition of the overburden sediment particles is primarily quartz, plagioclase, calcite and some accessory clay minerals, which can provide guidance for remolding the overburden sediments in the laboratory. The sediments show strain hardening and shear contraction behavior upon shearing; in addition, the established strength criterion will contribute to the formulation of constitutive equations for the overburden sediments, which can be used as essential input parameters in gas hydrate production simulations. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Photocatalytic oxidation of oil spill is a promising way due to its low cost, complete conversion and the capability of using free and abundant sunlight. For better interaction between oil, photocatalyst and the light, it is recommended to use floating photocatalysts. In this research, recycled drinking bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were used as a floating support for C3N4 and ZnO photocatalysts. ZnO?€?C3N4/r-PET composite with various amounts of ZnO (0, 5, 10 and 15 wt.%) were synthesized and characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM-EDX), N2-sorption isotherm (BET-BJH), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and UV?€?vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV?€?Vis DRS). The as-prepared ZnO?€?C3N4/r-PET nanocomposites were tested for the photocatalytic degradation of benzene. The results show that by increasing the amount of ZnO, the particle size decreased, size distribution narrowed and a more homogenous morphology was observed. Moreover, pore volume, pore diameter and BET surface area increased. In details, ZnO crystallite size reduced from 32 nm in ZnO?€?C3N4/r-PET nanocomposite with 5 wt.% of ZnO to 18 nm in similar nanocomposite with 15 wt.% of ZnO. Increasing the ZnO amount, broadened the band gap but enhanced the light absorption in visible and UV regions. Good interaction between C3N4 and ZnO was confirmed in TEM image. The highest degradation performance was obtained in the presence of 15 wt.% of ZnO. In fact by decreasing the amount of ZnO in the ZnO?€?C3N4/r-PET composite, the photodegradation rate decreased significantly. Influence of operating parameters like pH, catalyst loading, benzene volume percent and simulated sea conditions on photodegradation of floating benzene were also studied in details. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",

Gas outbursts occur frequently in the process of uncovering coal in crosscut, so it is of great significance to study the outburst conditions of coal and gas in the process of tunneling. By establishing the model of these gas outbursts, we can obtain the function of the thickness of stone gate, gas pressure and gas outburst. With or without high pressure gas, the impact of high pressure gas during gas bursts is analyzed through the numerical simulation method. Based on the velocity, displacement, maximum principal stress and time curve of coal and rock interface in the center of roadway under two kinds of working conditions, the main conditions of gas bursts have been successfully verified. According to the results, in coal and gas outbursts, necessary conditions include the plastic zone penetration caused by high pressure gas storage and excavation disturbance, while sufficient conditions include the mutation of velocity field, displacement field and stress field in plastic zones. ??

M8W4NIG9,10.1371/journal.pone.0233332,Microfiber release from real soiled consumer laundry and the impact of fabric care products and washing conditions,"Fiber release during domestic textile washing is a cause of marine microplastic pollution, but better understanding of the magnitude of the issue and role of fabric care products, appliances and washing cycles is needed. Soiled consumer wash loads from U.K. households were found to release a mean of 114 ?? 66.8 ppm (mg microfiber per kg fabric) (n = 79) fibers during typical washing conditions and these were mainly composed of natural fibers. Microfiber release decreased with increasing wash load size and hence decreasing water to fabric ratio, with mean microfiber release from wash loads in the mass range 1.0?€?3.5 kg (n = 57) found to be 132.4 ?? 68.6 ppm, significantly (p = 3.3 x 10???8) higher than the 66.3 ?? 27.0 ppm of those in the 3.5?€?6.0 kg range (n = 22). In further tests with similar soiled consumer wash loads, moving to colder and quicker washing cycles (i.e. 15??C for 30 mins, as opposed to 40??C for 85 mins) significantly reduced microfiber generation by 30% (p = 0.036) and reduced whiteness loss by 42% (p = 0.000) through reduced dye transfer and soil re-deposition, compared to conventional 40??C cycles. In multicycle technical testing, detergent pods were selected for investigation and found to have no impact on microfiber release compared to washing in water alone. Fabric softeners were also found to have no direct impact on microfiber release in testing under both European and North American washing conditions. Extended testing of polyester fleece garments up to a 48-wash cycle history under European conditions found that microfiber release significantly reduced to a consistent low level of 28.7 ?? 10.9 ppm from eight through 64 washes. Emerging North American High-Efficiency top-loading washing machines generated significantly lower microfiber release than traditional top-loading machines, likely due to their lower water fill volumes and hence lower water to fabric ratio, with a 69.7% reduction observed for polyester fleece (n = 32, p = 7.9 x 10???6) and 37.4% reduction for polyester T-shirt (n = 32, p = 0.0032). These results conclude that consumers can directly reduce the levels of microfibers generated per wash during domestic textile washing by using colder and quicker wash cycles, washing complete (but not overfilled) loads, and (in North America) converting to High-Efficiency washing machines. Moving to colder and quicker cycles will also indirectly reduce microfiber release by extending the lifetime of clothing, leading to fewer new garments being purchased and hence lower incidence of the high microfiber release occurring during the first few washes of a new item. ?? 2020 Lant et al.

Applying different heating pattern, plate with 6 mm in thickness will buckle as saddle shape due to the multiple-line heating in longitudinal direction and its generated large enough compressive force. Moreover, thermal elastic plastic (TEP) FE and elastic FE computational approaches were proposed and employed. Predicted out-of-plane bending deformations both have good agreement with measurement.

Composite structures are typically composed of multiple parts which are connected using adhesive joints. The most efficient adhesive joints use tapered adherends where the taper reduces the adherend stiffness over the length of the joint thereby reducing peak shear stresses in the adhesive layer. Typically the tapers are produced through secondary machining or stepped ply terminations. This research investigates an alternative method of reducing the adherend stiffness over the length of the joint through fiber tow steering (FTS). The performance of a double FTS strap joint is compared with a standard double-strap joint as well as double step-taper strap joint. The results show that while the FTS joint showed a 12% increase in capacity in comparison to the standard double-strap joint it showed much lower strength in comparison with the step-taper joint due to the presence of high peel stresses at the ends of the FTS joint.

By scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, the 'sea' components are extracted with increasing NaOH concentration until 25% omf NaOH, and damage of the 'island' components above 25% omf NaOH leads to a reduction in tensile strength. The dyeing conditions, including temperature (95-135 ??C), time (20-60 min), pH buffer solution concentration (1-9 g/L), and contents of dispersant (1-9 g/L) and UV-absorbent (5-25% omf) were also explored. The optimal dyeing conditions were established as a dye concentration of 8% omf with 1 g/L dispersant, 1 g/L pH buffer solution concentration, and 10% omf UV-absorbent at 135 ??C for 40 min at a 1:10 goods-to-liquor ratio. The rubbing colorfastness values for the fabrics dyed with the black disperse dye spanned four grades under dry and wet conditions. The light colorfastness values of the dyed fabrics were good to excellent in the range of 4-5 grades. ?? 2020 by the authors.",
N3Z34PLP,10.2478/pomr-2020-0037,Validation Process for Computational Model of Full-Scale Segment for Design of Composite Footbridge,"Experimental tests and numerical simulations of a full-scale segment of a foot and cycle bridge made of polymer composites are presented in the paper. The analysed structure is made of sandwich panels, which consist of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) multi-layered laminate faces and a PET foam (obtained from recycling) core. The dimensions of the segment cross-section are the same as for the target footbridge; however, span length was reduced to 3 m. The experimental tests were conducted in a laboratory of the Faculty of Ocean Engineering and Ship Technology at Gdansk University of Technology. A single vertical force was generated by a hydraulic cylinder and was applied to the platform of the structure. The experimental tests were supported by numerical analyses performed in Femap with NX Nastran software by means of the finite element method (FEM). Results obtained in the computational model were compared with results from experiments. Thus, the numerical model was validated and the obtained conclusions were used in the next step of the design process of a composite footbridge with a span length of 14.5 m. ?? 2020 Tomasz Ferenc et al., published by Sciendo.",
NUWXJ5NE,10.3390/app10113962,The hybrid joints between an frp panel and a steel panel through tubular reinforcements: A methodology for interlaminar stress calculations,"The advantages of laminates in terms of the chemical properties and mechanical properties/weight relationship have motivated several applications of fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) composites in naval constructions due to the reduction in structural weight. This weight advantage has motivated multiple investigations dedicated to dissimilar material joints. We present a methodology for the interlaminar stress calculations of a tubular hybrid joint between an FRP panel and a steel panel through tubular reinforcements. The proposed formulas allow the estimation of the shear and normal stresses on the adhesive, which are generated in the bonding angle of the tubular hybrid joint. The stresses generated at the adhesive bonding ends influence on the adherent's adjacent layer. A failure criterion is shown to check the accomplishment of the resulting stresses in the adherent laminate. Finally, the proposed formulas are validated using the finite element method and compared with the obtained interlaminar stresses. ?? 2020 by the authors.",
EUL8HQYP,10.1111/1365-2478.12952,Integration of rock physics and seismic inversion for rock typing and flow unit analysis: A case study,"Rock typing and flow unit detection are more challenging in clastic reservoirs with a uniform pore system. An integrated workflow based on well logs, inverted seismic data and rock physics models is proposed and developed to address such challenges. The proposed workflow supplies a plausible reservoir model for further investigation and adds extra information. Then, this workflow has been implemented in order to define different rock types and flow units in an oilfield in the Persian Gulf, where some of these difficulties have been observed. Here, rock physics models have the leading role in our proposed workflow by providing a diagnostic framework in which we successfully differentiate three rock types with variant characteristics on the given wells. Furthermore, permeability and porosity are calculated using the available rock physics models to define several flow units. Then, we extend our investigation to the entire reservoir by means of simultaneous inversion and rock physics models. The outcomes of the study suggest that in sediments with homogeneous pore size distribution, other reservoir properties such as shale content and cementation (which have distinct effects on the elastic domain) can be used to identify rock types and flow units. These reservoir properties have more physical insights for modelling purposes and can be distinguished on seismic cube using proper rock physics models. The results illustrate that the studied reservoir mainly consists of rock type B, which is unconsolidated sands and has the characteristics of a reservoir for subsequent fluid flow unit analysis. In this regard, rock type B has been divided into six fluid units in which the first detected flow unit is considered as the cleanest unit and has the highest reservoir process speed about 4800 to 5000 mD. Here, reservoir quality decreases from flow unit 1 to flow unit 6. ?? 2020 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers",

The results revealed that eggs of H. pugilunus showed 25 ?? 5.0 mm, 10 ?? 2.5 mm and 4 ?? 0.9 mm in length, width and apical opening respectively; in R. rapiformis, the measurements of length, width and apical opening were 17 ?? 2.0 mm, 5 ?? 0.7 mm and 3 ?? 0.3 mm respectively. The egg capsules of H. pugilinus and R. rapiformis were examined in Light (Optical) Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscopic studies for their ultra-structure. Hemifusus pugilinus was made up of a mass loosely packed band branched fibers in the same orientation, but R. rapiformis had very compactly packed fibers without branching. The results of eggs capsule tensile strength of H. pugilinus and R. rapiformis were found to be 7.5767 MPa and 60.4200 MPa respectively. Further, FTIR was performed using raw egg capsules powder and the results were discussed. Based on the present investigation, egg capsules showed much ability to act as a biofiber and biodegradable plastics rather than synthesized polymer. Hence, further research should be needed to bring out the biopolymer materials from these gastropods. ?? 2019, Zoological Society, Kolkata, India.",
BDKBZ6BV,10.1007/s11368-019-02527-9,From waste to resource: mycoremediation of contaminated marine sediments in the SEDITERRA Project,"Purpose: Port-dredging activities produce large volumes of contaminated sediments. Dredged sediments are considered a waste by national laws, but recently the desire to consider them a resource has become widespread and remedies for their contamination are being searched to allow their reuse. In this work, we studied, developed, and tested a method for remediate marine-dredged sediments contaminated by heavy metals using native fungi and a microporous membrane, in order to achieve the sediment quality and allow their reuse. Materials and methods: Activity was carried out on port sediments from Genoa, Leghorn, Pisa, and Cagliari (Italy). Autochthonous fungi were isolated from each sediment and employed in mycoremediation tests. Two plastic boxes were prepared (for each Port) with 5 kg of sediment in each box, employed for metal bioaccumulation using a sterile polyester membrane inoculated with fungi. Membranes were analyzed at 15, 30, and 60 days after inoculums, and sediments were analyzed after 60 days at the end of the experiment to verify metal contamination degree. Recovery efficiency (RE%) and difference recovery efficiency (DRE%) were calculated for each experiment: the first shows the absorption capability of the membrane-fungi consortium; the second evidences only the fungal contribution to the metal absorption. To assess sediment contamination before and after the mycoremediation treatment, we considered chemical levels of reference L1 (the lowest chemical level of reference) and L2 (the highest chemical level of reference), and the evaluation of chemical hazard (HQ) for the chemical contaminants defined by the Italian Ministerial Decree 173/2016. Results and discussion: Fungi from Genoa sediments increase the membrane absorption of Cu and Zn. Regarding Leghorn results, RE (%) increases and reaches the maximum value after 60 days of treatment for each considered metal. Cr tot, Ni, and Mn appear to be hyper-bioaccumulated. DRE values of Pisa sediments show that Mn is excluded by fungi and it does not bioaccumulate, while other metals and in particular Cd, Cr tot, Zn, and Sb are bioaccumulated. Cagliari DREs show that fungi are not able to bioaccumulate Cr tot, Ni, and Mn and their accumulation is due to the membrane, while As and Cd are bioaccumulated. Conclusions: Our work evidenced that selected fungi are able to grow on a microporous support and actively reduce metal concentrations in the sediments, achieving their quality. This biomembrane system may represent an important instrument for the remediation of the residual metal contamination of port sediments. ?? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",
RKWYWTVN,10.2108/zs190142,Global Distribution and Variation of the Invasive Cheilostome Bryozoan Cribrilina mutabilis,"Viable populations of the cheilostome bryozoan Cribrilina mutabilis Ito, Onishi & Dick exist in the NW Pacific (Russian Far East and northern Japan), NE Atlantic (Scandinavia and Scotland), and NW Atlantic (Maine, USA). The first NE and NW Atlantic records are from Norway (2008) and Casco Bay, Maine, USA (2018), respectively, indicating a relatively recent introduction to the region. Mitochondrial COI gene sequences from North Atlantic populations (Sweden, Norway, and Maine) showed two haplotypes differing by one substitution, but differed from two haplotypes from Akkeshi, northern Japan, by 6-8 substitutions. North Atlantic populations differed morphologically from the Akkeshi population in that some zooids formed a suboral projection, and frontal zooids were more common. While C. mutabilis in northern Japan has been found only on natural or artificial eelgrass (Zostera marina), across its range it has been found on several species of algae, plastic panels and strips, several species of Zostera, and mollusc shells. Similar frequencies of heteromorphic zooids with differing degree of frontal wall calcification, i.e., R (rib)-, I (intermediate)-, and S (shield)-Type zooids, in colonies on eelgrass at comparable times of the season and across populations suggest an innate response to seasonal environmental fluctuations, although zooid frequencies were different on non-eelgrass substrates. The increase in trans-Arctic shipping along the Northern Sea Route in recent decades, and previous documentation of C. mutabilis on ship hulls in the Sea of Japan, indicate a clear mechanism for anthropogenic introduction from the Far East to Europe in recent decades. ?? 2020 Zoological Society of Japan.",
Y8TT8N2K,,Some Factors That Influence the Prediction of the Behaviour of Piled Rafts via Simplified (Numerical) Analyses,"This article evaluates two distinct external effects on the settlement results from standard analyses of piled raft foundation systems. The influence of the excavation level and the influence of the number of piles underneath the pile will be separately assessed by two independent analyses for two published case histories, respectively a house located in Gothenburg and another in Uppsala, Sweden. They have been initially presented by Hansbo (1993) and Hansbo and K??llstr??m (1983). Both structures were founded over a soft, highly plastic marine clay of varying thickness, where the foundation was designed by using the concept of ?€?creep piling?€?, i.e., piles in a state of full load mobilization. The analyses were carried out with the numerical tools DEFPIG and GARP, by considering a series of simplified assumptions for the load pattern, raft and pile characteristics and subsoil profile. The soil, pile and load characteristics have been considered, with analyses that allowed (and not) the effect of the excavation level (1st case history), and with variation (optimization) of the number of piles (2nd. case history). The exercise emphasizes the importance of the consideration of the excavation level for the proper assessment of the settlement pattern underneath the raft, and the beneficial aspect on the optimization of the number of piles in the piled raft design. ?? 2020 Southeast Asian Geotechnical Society.

Environmental parameters measured show that the seawater properties of the Quempill??n estuary (i.e.Temperature, salinity, pCO2, pH and ??CaCO3) were highly fluctuating and related with season and tide. We test the effects of increasing temperature and pCO2 in the seawater on the physiological energetics of the bivalve Ostrea chilensis. Juvenile oysters were exposed to an orthogonal combination of three temperatures (10, 15, and 20C) and two pCO2 levels ( 400 and 1000 atm) for a period of 60 days to evaluate the temporal effect (i.e. 10, 20, 30, 60 days) on the physiological rates of the oysters. Results indicated a significant effect of temperature and time of exposure on the clearance rate, while pCO2 and the interaction between pCO2 and the other factors studied did not show significant effects. Significant effects of temperature and time of exposure were also observed on the absorption rate, but not the pCO2 nor its interaction with other factors studied. Oxygen consumption was significantly affected by pCO2, temperature and time. Scope for growth was only significantly affected by time; despite this, the highest values were observed for individuals subject to to 20C and to 1000 atm pCO2. In this study, Ostrea chilensis showed high phenotypic plasticity to respond to the high levels of temperature and pCO2 experienced in its habitat as no negative physiological effects were observed. Thus, the highly variable conditions of this organism's environment could select for individuals that are more resistant to future scenarios of climate change, mainly to warming and acidification.

Juvenile E. singaporense, individually reared in plastic glasses containing 250 mL sea water, were fed five fish meal-soybean meal-microbound diets variously containing dietary protein levels of 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% and 50% for six weeks. A completely randomized design was used in the experiment, comprising five treatments with 60 crabs in each. At the end of the experiment, a significant improvement in survival was observed in all treatments relative to the diet containing 30% dietary protein (p < 0.05) while the growth performance parameters did not differ across the five dietary groups. A significantly higher protein efficiency ratio was observed in the E. singaporense crabs receiving 45% dietary protein relative to the remaining treatments. The specific activities of the digestive enzymes, pepsin-like, trypsin, amylase, and lipase, and the amylase to trypsin ratio fluctuated across the five treatments, but that of chymotrypsin remained consistent, suggesting different nutritional responses to the various dietary protein levels. The crabs receiving the 45% protein diet had significantly higher in essential amino acid (EAA) profiles followed by the 40% protein diet, although some EAA values were only moderate. The pattern for the non-EAA (NEAA) was reversed, and the ??EAA/??NEAA ratio was higher in the crabs receiving the 45% protein diets relative to the other treatments. Based on our investigations, the optimal dietary protein requirement achieving desirable characteristics of juvenile E. singaporense crabs was 45%. This finding would be a useful guideline in preparing artificial diets for the mariculture of this species. ?? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",
ADCRASEL,10.1007/s10853-020-04505-w,Structure and evolution of multiphase composites for 3D printing,"Ethylene-vinyl acetate?€?glycidyl methacrylate random terpolymer (EVM?€?GMA, VA = 60 wt%, GMA = 2.9%) was used as a polymeric plasticizer replacing the traditional dioctyl phthalate (DOP) to prepare a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) masterbatch. Polylactic acid (PLA) was applied to blend with the PVC masterbatch in melt to examine the epoxy ring-opening reactions between epoxy groups in EVM?€?GMA and end carboxyl groups in PLA in order to construct a special phase structure in PVC/PLA improving the mechanical properties and 3D printing performance. The formation and evolution of phase structures were revealed by aids of the unique rheological responses of multi-component composite system. The results showed that with the increase in EVM?€?GMA content, the phase morphology of PVC/PLA was refined from co-continuous phase structure to denser one and then evolved to sea-island structure. It was also found that the addition of EVM?€?GMA inhibited the crystallization of PLA and the cold crystallization as well. When PVC/EVM?€?GMA/PLA was incorporated in weight ratio of 45/5/50, the denser co-continuous phase structure with smaller domain imparted the composite a highest zero shear viscosity and viscous flow activation energy. This unique structure existed stably when the shear rate was less than 230 s???1 or below 180 ??C. Consequently, it endowed composite the highest impact strengths and smoothest appearance of 3D printed specimens. Therefore, moderate EVM?€?GMA is not only a reliable alternative plasticizer for PVC, but also an ideal modifier for the compatibility of PVC/PLA blends which presented an excellent performance in 3D printing. ?? 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

The discrete BFRP needles, with an aspect ratio of 10.0, were cut from BFRP bar production scrap and mixed into fresh concrete to replace 20% of the coarse aggregates by volume. The axial compression properties and lateral bending properties of the tubular columns were tested. The test variables included the wall thickness of the GFRP tubes (i.e., 3 mm and 4 mm), the type of coarse aggregates (i.e., gravel or coral), and the incorporation of BFRP needles or not. Additionally, unconfined bare columns were tested for comparison. The test results showed that the inclusion of BFRP needles had moderate adverse effects on the peak compressive strength of bare columns: the peak axial stress reduced slightly by 2.5% for gravel concrete and 7.2% for coral concrete, respectively. Besides, for the four types of concrete in this paper, the 3- and 4-mm GFRP tube-confinement increased the peak axial compressive strengths by 23 52% and 65 83%, respectively. In addition, the adoption of GFRP tubes was able to improve the bending performance of columns significantly, especially for energy consumption. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
M9U4WZLA,10.17159/sajs.2020/7677,The transport and fate of marine plastics in South Africa and adjacent oceans,"South Africa is thought to be one of the worst contributors of plastic into the sea globally. Although some plastic items derive from offshore sources (mainly fishing and other maritime activities, but also long-distance transport), the importance of local, land-based sources is indicated by the composition of beach debris and the concentration of macro-, meso- and microplastics close to urban source areas. Some 60-90% of plastic from land-based sources is expected to strand on beaches, but plastic standing stocks on beaches are much lower than global model predictions of land-based pollution. Burial in beaches and transport into backshore vegetation are significant sinks, although this plastic is likely to be released as the climate crisis leads to rising sea levels and more extreme storms. Most buried items are fairly small, while many larger items, which account for most of the mass of plastic, are removed from beaches by cleaning efforts. However, even daily accumulation rate estimates - which exclude the effects of cleaning - fall well short of model predictions of plastic leakage from land-based sources. Oceanographic models predict that plastics entering the sea from South Africa are exported to the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, with the proportion depending on source location and item density. At sea, floating macroplastic is concentrated close to urban centres. Farther offshore, plastic items tend to be large and buoyant because biofouling causes small, low buoyancy items to sink. Size-selective removal of plastics by biota might also contribute to the paucity of floating microplastics (<1 mm). The seabed is likely to be the main long-term sink for waste plastics, but the limited data available indicate low levels of plastics on the seabed off South Africa. Only a small proportion of plastic predicted to leak into the sea from South Africa can be accounted for. However, this should not delay the implementation of effective mitigation measures to limit plastic leakage. Significance: ?€? High densities of waste plastic around urban centres indicate that most macro- and microplastics come from local, land-based sources and do not disperse far at sea. ?€? Beach clean-ups remove up to 90% of the mass of stranded plastic, largely found in macroplastic items (>25 mm). ?€? The seabed is a long-term sink for marine plastics, but densities of plastic on the seabed around South Africa are still modest. ?€? The global model prediction of plastic leakage from South Africa into the sea probably is a gross overestimate. ?? 2020. The Author(s). Published under a Creative Commons Attribution Licence.",
K6ZJIM7U,10.17159/sajs.2020/7678,Monitoring marine plastics - will we know if we are making a difference?,"In the context of marine anthropogenic debris management, monitoring is essential to assess whether mitigation measures to reduce the amounts of waste plastic entering the environment are being effective. In South Africa, baselines against which changes can be assessed include data from the 1970s to the 1990s on microplastics floating at sea, on macro- and microplastic beach debris, and interactions with biota. However, detecting changes in the abundance of microplastics at sea is complicated by high spatial and temporal heterogeneity in net samples. Beach debris data are easier to gather, but their interpretation is complicated by the dynamic nature of debris fluxes on beaches and the increase in beach cleaning effort over time. Sampling plastic ingested by biota is a powerful approach, because animals that retain ingested plastic for protracted periods integrate plastics over space and time, but there are ethical issues to using biota as bioindicators, particularly for species that require destructive sampling (e.g. turtles, seabirds). Bioindicators could be established among fish and invertebrates, but there are technical challenges with sampling microplastics smaller than 1 mm. Fine-scale debris accumulation on beaches provides an index of macroplastic abundance in coastal waters, and offers a practical way to track changes in the amounts and composition of debris in coastal waters. However, upstream flux measures (i.e. in catchments, rivers and storm-water run-off) provide a more direct assessment of mitigation measures for land-based sources. Similarly, monitoring refuse returned to port by vessels is the best way to ensure compliance with legislation prohibiting the dumping of plastics at sea. Significance: ?€? Monitoring is required to assess whether mitigation measures to reduce waste plastics at sea are making a difference. ?€? Monitoring the leakage of plastic from land-based sources is best addressed on land (e.g. in storm drains and river run-off) before the plastic reaches the sea. ?€? Illegal dumping from ships is best addressed by monitoring the use of port waste reception facilities. ?€? Sampling plastic ingested by biota is a powerful approach, using fish and invertebrates as bioindicators for larger microplastic fragments. ?? 2020. The Author(s).

W9UBVQJH,10.3389/fmars.2020.00369,Deep-Sea Debris in the Central and Western Pacific Ocean,"Marine debris is a growing problem in the world?€?s deep ocean. The naturally slow biological and chemical processes operating at depth, coupled with the types of materials that are used commercially, suggest that debris is likely to persist in the deep ocean for long periods of time, ranging from hundreds to thousands of years. However, the realized scale of marine debris accumulation in the deep ocean is unknown due to the logistical, technological, and financial constraints related to deep-ocean exploration. Coordinated deep-water exploration from 2015 to 2017 enabled new insights into the status of deep-sea marine debris throughout the central and western Pacific Basin via ROV expeditions conducted onboard NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer and RV Falkor. These expeditions included sites in United States protected areas and monuments, other Exclusive Economic Zones, international protected areas, and areas beyond national jurisdiction. Metal, glass, plastic, rubber, cloth, fishing gear, and other marine debris were encountered during 17.5% of the 188 dives from 150 to 6,000 m depth. Correlations were observed between deep-sea debris densities and depth, geological features, and distance from human-settled land. The highest densities occurred off American Samoa and the main Hawaiian Islands. Debris, mostly consisting of fishing gear and plastic, were also observed in most of the large-scale marine protected areas, adding to the growing body of evidence that even deep, remote areas of the ocean are not immune from human impacts. Interactions with and impacts on biological communities were noted, though further study is required to understand the full extent of these impacts. We also discuss potential sources and long-term implications of this debris. ?? Copyright ?? 2020 Amon, Kennedy, Cantwell, Suhre, Glickson, Shank and Rotjan.",
XF4ARD36,10.17159/sajs.2020/7695,Impacts of marine plastic on ecosystem services and economy: State of South African research,"In addition to its direct impacts on marine ecology and biota, marine plastic debris can affect the delivery of ecosystem services, with resulting impacts on human well-being, society and the economy. It is important to quantify these impacts in economic terms, so as to be able to provide evidence-based support for an appropriate policy response. We review the South African literature on the impacts of marine plastic debris on ecosystem services and on the economy, in order to identify relevant knowledge gaps. The gaps are found to be significant. Some research has been conducted in terms of impacts relating to recreation, aesthetics and tourism and the costs of beach and harbour clean-ups. However, there is a significant lack of research regarding impacts on ecosystem services relating to fisheries and aquaculture, heritage, habitat provision, biodiversity, and nutrient cycles. There is also a significant lack of research regarding direct economic impacts on the transport/shipping and fisheries industries, indirect economic impacts (such as costs associated with health-related impacts), and non-market costs (e.g. impacts on scenic, cultural and spiritual values). More research is needed in South Africa to address these gaps, in order to inform policy aimed at addressing plastic waste and marine plastic debris. Significance: ?€? This review highlights the knowledge gaps in terms of the impacts of marine plastics on ecosystem services and on the economy in South Africa, which are important to understand in order to be able to direct funding for future research in this domain.

Flexural strengths and behaviors of PHC piles reinforced with hybrid GFRP and steel bars were experimentally investigated, respectively. Large-scale specimens with total lengths of 12,000 mm and diameters of 600 mm were constructed and tested under bending, accompanied by evaluation of effects of non-prestressed reinforcement type and longitudinal reinforcement ratio. J-factors were calculated to evaluate deformability of all the specimens. PHC piles reinforced with GFRP bars were demonstrated to have much higher flexural capacity than those reinforced with steel bars. Moreover, strains at the midspans of cross sections of all the specimens basically conformed to the assumption of plane section. Failure of PHC piles reinforced with GFRP bars was attributable to gradual concrete crushing, while that of PHC piles reinforced with steel bars resulted from steel yielding.

The mismanagement of waste is worse in the rural area where the number of available public trashcan is limited and the people have no idea where their trash actually ends up. In this research, a case study of waste management in Kampung Cipare-Tenjo, a small village 80 kilometers away from Jakarta, is conducted. The biggest purpose of the research is to educate people about sanitation and waste management, initiated by computing the most optimum number and locations of the public trashcans. The problem is addressed as Maximum Covering Location Problem (MCLP) to determine a set of facility locations that maximizes the total demand population served by the facilities within a prespecified maximum service distance. Two greedy heuristics algorithms: Greedy Adding Algorithm (GAA) and Greedy Adding with Substitution Algorithm (GAAS) are utilized to solve the problem. A sensitivity analysis is also done to check the result on the effect of trashcan number and maximum service distance to demand coverage. Out of the 26 location candidates, it is concluded that the final 10 locations are the most optimum in terms of demand coverage and service distance.

The microplastic size ranged from 10 to 5000 ??m and were black, gray, blue, and transparent. Fiber, as the dominant shape, contributed up to 99.2% of the identified microplastics. The most common polymers were rayon (48.9%) followed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (29.6%). Microplastics in tap water and water sources differed in size and polymer types but showed specific correlations. The analysis of Laoshan Reservoir and Jihongtan Reservoir indicated that human activities and atmospheric deposition contributed to the microplastics in the water sources.

Our results raise concerns for the potential transfer of synthetic materials through the marine food web and into humans, given the prominent role of S. pilchardus and E. encrasicolus within the food web as main food source for many marine species. ?? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

Concentrations ranged from 5 to 8216 nmol kg???1 and were greater on beaches more influenced by the mining activity. A preference of Hg for polymers such as polyurethane (PUR) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and for certain colours such as black, red and brown was observed. The state of degradation proved crucial, as Hg levels increased with the aging of the plastic. Although new commercial plastic items already contain Hg associated with their manufacturing process, they are able to adsorb even more once in the marine environment, by being in contact with larger quantities of this element in the ocean microlayer and acting as vectors of this element to the beaches. Once there, plastics are transported by winds and tides to the middle and high part of the beach, where the sunlight results in the volatilization of Hg to the atmosphere, decreasing the levels of this element in plastics. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
YMHV9ASW,10.1016/j.marchem.2020.103780,"Observations and idealized modelling of microplastic transport in estuaries: The exemplary case of an upwelling system (R??a de Vigo, NW Spain)","Microplastics (MPs) pollution in marine environments has received considerable attention over the past two decades due to the increased awareness of its potential risks to ecosystems. Numerical simulations can be used to provide estimates of MPs fate and distribution, but so far this approach has been largely applied to the open ocean. In this work, the distribution patterns of MPs in a prototype coastal upwelling environment (R??a de Vigo estuary, Spain) is investigated using a combined approach of field data and modelling. Water and sediment samples were collected at different locations along the R??a during both upwelling and downwelling conditions. Experiments using an idealized 2D-vertical model were conducted to explain the observed MP distribution and elucidate the relative importance of river discharge, wind-driven and density-driven circulation. Microplastics were found at all stations in all samples. The largest observed fraction of MPs corresponded to fibres followed by plastic paint sheets and fragments. The trapping or flushing of MPs was mainly controlled by the wind forcing, whose effects on the circulation normally exceeds those of the density-driven and river flows. During upwelling conditions, more MP items were collected near the surface at the outer half of the estuary than during downwelling. The seaward near-surface circulation induced by the wind and density gradient jointly contributed to flushing out floating MPs. Near the bottom, the landward wind-induced and gravitational circulation formed estuarine MP maxima (EMPM) inside the estuary. Pellets, fragments, and films were more efficiently trapped than fibres, as their EMPM were located more upstream. The results suggested that downwelling-favourable winds caused an overall landward (seaward) displacement of the distribution of floating (sinking) MPs. Modelling results indicate that winds dominate the circulation in the outer part of the estuary, whereas near the head the gravitational circulation takes over the control of the net flow. The particular location of the EMPM appears to be controlled by the competition of density-driven and wind-driven flows. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

The disposal of single-use packaging products imposes a substantial toll on the environment. A large fraction of this waste ends up in landfills causing pollution in both marine and land environment. Sustainable applications of utilizing such waste material which can reduce the landfill requirement for the glass and plastic wastes acquires global attention. In this study, recycled plastic waste (RPW) and recycled crushed glass (RCG) were mixed in concrete and a field trial was conducted for concrete footpaths in the state of Victoria in Australia. Samples of the concrete mix were collected and the mechanical properties such as unconfined compressive strength, indirect tensile strength and capillary water uptake was tested in laboratory. Non-destructive field test using the Schmidt hammer was carried out to evaluate the compressive strength of various points located on the footpath and the results were compared with the standard set by local authorities. Result of this field study indicated that the concrete design mix containing 10% RPW and 10% RCG (volume percentage) meets the local council standard used in concrete footpath construction. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional economy (fabrication, use and dispose) in which we keep resources in a loop for as much time as possible, try to maintain their value while in use, and repurpose for generation of new products at the end of utilization. The value of the global fashion industry is 3000 Billion dollars that accounts for more than 2% of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (https://fashionunited.com/global-fashion-industry-statistics/). In the last two decades not only the textile industry has doubled the production but also an average global annual consumption of textiles has doubled from 7 to 13 kg per person and reached to the threshold of 100 million tonnes of textiles consumption. More than two thirds of the textile goes to landfill at the end of their use and just around 15% is recycled. Various scientific studies confirm that the disposal nature of fast fashion and throwaway culture is resulting in a serious environmental, health, social and economic concern. One of the global environmental challenges arising from micro-plastic and micro-textile waste entering into the oceans that can end up in fish and eventually food chain. Herein, through a systematic literature review, the significance of circular fashion and textile is highlighted and various approaches for reuse, recycle and repurposing of the textiles waste as well as disruptive scientific breakthroughs, innovations and strategies towards a circular textile economy have been discussed. Looking into the future, remarks have been made in regards to tackling the key challenges in recycling of textile materials in different stages of their manufacturing process. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

In this paper, the bearing behavior and serviceability evaluation of SWSSC beams reinforced with basalt FRP (BFRP) bars were studied. A total of 10 beams with lengths of 2100 mm, widths of 180 mm, and heights of 300, 250 and 350 mm were constructed. The experimental parameters included the reinforcement ratio, section height, bar diameter and bar type. The test results were discussed in terms of failure modes, bearing capacity, deflection and crack width. With an increase in the reinforcement ratio, the failure mode of the specimen transitions from tensile failure, to balance failure and ultimately to compressive failure. The flexural capacity, crack width and deflection of the FRP-SWSSC beams are much higher than that of a steel-SWSSC beam. Increasing the reinforcement ratio or the section height can increase the bending stiffness of the beam, which consequently increases the bearing capacity and reduces the strain, deflection and crack width of the beams. However, beams with similar axial stiffnesses exhibit similar flexural behaviors. BFRP bars with smaller diameters have better bonding properties with the concrete, thus reducing the crack width, while the bearing capacity and deflection are not affected. The curvature limit of 0.005/d can meet the deflection and crack width serviceability requirements of BFRP-SWSSC beams. In addition, the experimental results are compared with the existing design specifications, and at 0.3Mn, both the ACI 440.1R-15 and GB 50608-10 specifications underestimate the deflection value of the test beam, while the CSA S806-12 specification conservatively overestimates the deflection value of the beam. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

However, the role of photodegradation in altering toxicity of MPs to marine organisms is poorly understood. We therefore investigated the photolytic transformation of pristine polystyrene fragments (P-PS) by 60-day ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and compared the toxicity of P-PS, photodegraded PS (PD-PS), and commercially available polystyrene microbeads (C-PS) to juvenile grouper (Epinephelus moara). Photodegradation reduced the size from ??&amp;circ;55.9 ??m of P-PS to ??&amp;circ;38.6 ??m of PD-PS, even produced nanoparticles (??&amp;circ;75 nm) with a yield of 7.03 ?? 0.37% (w/w), and induced surface oxidation and formation of persistent free radicals (e.g., CO????, COO????). Also, endogenous pollutants (chemical additives and polymer fragments) were leached out. Thus, PD-PS had the highest growth inhibition and lipidosis-driven hepatic lesions of grouper, followed by P-PS and C-PS, which was mainly explained by increased hepatic bioaccumulation of MPs/NPs and released endogenous toxicants. Furthermore, oxidative stress-triggered mitochondrial depolarization, suppression of fatty acid oxidation and transport, and promotion of inflammation were identified as the key mechanisms for the enhanced hepatotoxicity after photodegradation. This work provides new insight into the potential hazard and harm of MPs in marine environments after photodegradation. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

Photographic surveys at the long-term ecological research (LTER) observatory HAUSGARTEN, in the eastern Fram Strait, have enabled the assessment of spatial and temporal variability of seafloor litter in the Arctic. Previous studies of time-series data (2002?€?2014) reported an increase in litter quantities from the northernmost and central stations. Here, we extended the analysis by three years until 2017 and included data from the southernmost station. A total of 16,157 images covering 60.5 km2 were analyzed and combined with previous studies, to determine litter density, type and size compositions. Moreover, the interaction of litter with epibenthic megafauna was evaluated. Indicators of local maritime traffic, fisheries activity and summer sea ice extent were examined as potential drivers. The mean annual litter density ranged between 813 ?? 525 (SEM) and 6,717 ?? 2,044 (SEM) items km?€?2. Litter density clearly increased over time, and the northernmost station experienced the strongest increase. Plastics dominated at two of the stations whereas the northern station harbored mainly glass. Small-sized items accounted for 63%. Interaction with epibenthic fauna was frequent, especially with sessile organisms. Litter densities correlated with fishing and tourism vessel abundance, but no correlation was found with summer sea ice extent. This 15-year record of marine litter shows that even secluded Arctic ecosystems become increasingly subject to plastic pollution and that it will likely continue in the face of growing global plastic production rates and ineffective waste management policies. ??

However, the density of microplastics which is an important parameter to influence the fate of MPs in the environment has not been measured. Meanwhile, the MPs characteristics from coastal sediments of Bohai Bay remain unclear. In this study, the concentrations, distribution and composition (shapes and sizes) of MPs were investigated. The average concentration of MPs in the coastal sediments of Bohai Bay was 192.3 ?? 138.9 items/kg dw, which was at a moderate pollution level. The MPs with fiber shape (54.5%), small size (52.0%) and low density (PE and PP) were dominant. In addition, flotation experiment showed that most of PE and PP had the higher density compared with seawater. Digestion experiments suggested that the density change of MPs was caused by the co-contribution of biofouling and inorganic minerals. The density increasing rates of PE and PP were 7.4%?€?12.6% and 12.1%?€?17.5%, respectively. Finally, we also estimated that the total number of MPs in the sediments of Bohai Sea was 534 trillion, which were significantly higher than that in global ocean surface, suggesting that the coastal sediments could be the sink of MPs. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

However, while the number of studies documentating the ingestion of microplastics by fish has increased, fewer studies have addressed the toxicological effects derived from the ingestion of these small items in wild conditions. Here, MP contamination and effect biomarkers were investigated in three commercially important fish species from the North East Atlantic Ocean. From the 150 analysed fish (50 per species), 49 % had MP. In fish from the 3 species, MP in the gastrointestinal tract, gills and dorsal muscle were found. Fish with MP had significantly (p ??? 0.05) higher lipid peroxidation levels in the brain, gills and dorsal muscle, and increased brain acetylcholinesterase activity than fish where no MP were found. These results suggest lipid oxidative damage in gills and muscle, and neurotoxicity through lipid oxidative damage and acetylcholinesterase induction in relation to MP and/or MP-associated chemicals exposure. From the 150 fish analysed, 32 % had MP in dorsal muscle, with a total mean (?? SD) of 0.054 ?? 0.099 MP items/g. Based on this mean and on EFSA recommendation for fish consumption by adults or the general population, human consumers of Dicentrachus labrax, Trachurus trachurus, Scomber colias may intake 842 MP items/year from fish consumption only. Based on the mean of MP in fish muscle and data (EUMOFA, NOAA) of fish consumption per capita in selected European and American countries, the estimated intake of microplastics through fish consumption ranged from 518 to 3078 MP items/year/capita. Considering that fish consumption is only one of the routes of human exposure to microplastics, this study and others in the literature emphasize the need for more research, risk assessment and adoption of measures to minimize human exposure to these particles. Thus, MP pollution and its effects should be further investigated and addressed according to the WHO ?€?One Health?€? approach. ?? 2019 The Author(s)",
HQHX9V46,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137064,Periphytic biofilm: An innovative approach for biodegradation of microplastics,"Microplastics (MPs) have been gaining the attention of environmental researchers since the 1960s anecdotal reports of plastic entanglement and ingestion by marine creatures. Due to their increasing accretion in aquatic environments, as well as resistance towards degradation, marine litter research has focused on microplastics more recently. In the present study, a relatively new method of biodegradation was implemented for the biodegradation of three structurally different MPs i.e. polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Periphytic biofilm was used for this purpose in various backgrounds of carbon sources (glucose, peptone, and glucose and peptone). Biodegradation of MPs was estimated in terms of weight loss. It was observed that the addition of glucose enhanced the biodegradation of MPs by periphyton biofilm for all MPs (from 9.52%?€?18.02%, 5.95%?€?14.02% and 13.24?€?19.72% for PP, PE and PET respectively) after 60 days compared to natural biofilm alone. To the contrary, peptone, and glucose and peptone together, were inhibitory. Biodegradation was further confirmed by morphological changes observed using SEM, FTIR spectra and GPC lent further support to the results whereby new peaks appeared along with reduction in old peaks and decrease in peak intensities. MiSeq sequencing shows that Deinococcus-thermus > Proteobacteria > Cyanobacteria are the dominant phyla in natural biofilms, and their relative abundances increase after the addition of glucose. However, the abundances shifted to Deinococcus-thermus > Cyanobacteria > Firmicutes > Bacteroidetes, when the biofilms were treated with either peptone alone, or with glucose and peptone together. Therefore, the change in biodegradation capability might also be due to the change in the microbial community structures after addition of the C-sources. These experiments provide an innovative approach towards effective biodegradation of MPs using a relatively new environment-friendly method. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Recent studies have extended their focus from marine to inland waters, especially on the spatial-temporal distribution of the microplastics in urban rivers. In this study, Maozhou River, the largest river in Shenzhen, a tributary of the Pearl River, was selected as a representative inland waterway of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The spatial-temporal investigation was performed on microplastics in the surface water and sediments of 17 sites along the mainstream of the Maozhou River. Results show that microplastics were widely and unevenly distributed along the river and reached the high abundances on the site most intensively surrounded by industries as well as the sites downstream. The abundances in dry season ranged from 4.0 ?? 1.0 to 25.5 ?? 3.5 items??L???1 in water and 35 ?? 15 to 560 ?? 70 item??kg???1 in sediments, which were relatively higher than those observed in the wet season (water: 3.5 ?? 1.0 to 10.5 ?? 2.5 items??L???1; sediments: 25 ?? 5 to 360 ?? 90 item??kg???1; p value &lt; 0.05). The dominant types of the microplastics were identified as: PE Polyethylene (PE, water: 45.0%, sediments: 42.0%), polypropylene (PP, water and sediments: 12.5%), polystyrene (PS, water: 34.5%; sediments 14.5%) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC, water: 2.0%; sediments: 15%). Moreover, metals like Al, Si, Ca were discovered on the rough surface of the microplastics, indicating the interactions between the microplastics and the aquatic environment. Through a comprehensive comparison with other major inland waters in China, this work provides valuable data on the microplastics pollution of a representative inland water in the Greater Bay Area, and will further contribute to a better understanding on the land-based input of microplastics from the intensively affected inland waters. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

The uptake of microplastic-derived plasticizers by marine animals and the subsequent entry in the food chain raises concerns for adverse health effects in human beings. Frequently used plasticizers as the organophosphate ester tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) are known to affect the male reproductive system. However, the overall endocrine potential of TOCP and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive as yet. In this study, we investigated the molecular effects of TOCP on estrogen receptor ?? (ER??)-transfected HEK-ESR1 cells and the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Applying virtual screening and molecular docking, we identified TOCP as potent ligand of ER?? in silico. Microscale thermophoresis confirmed the binding in vitro with similar intensity as the natural ligand 17-??-estradiol. To identify the molecular mechanisms of TOCP-mediated effects, we used next-generation sequencing to analyze the gene expression pattern of TOCP-treated MCF-7 cells. RNA-sequencing revealed 22 differently expressed genes associated with ESR1 as upstream regulator: CYP1A1, SLC7A11, RUNX2, DDIT4, STC2, KLHL24, CCNG2, CEACAM5, SLC7A2, MAP1B, SLC7A5, IGF1R, CD55, FOSL2, VEGFA, and HSPA13 were upregulated and PRKCD, CCNE1, CEBPA, SFPQ, TNFAIP2, KRT19 were downregulated. The affected genes promote tumor growth by increasing angiogenesis and nutritional supply, favor invasion and metastasis, and interfere with the cell cycle. Based on the gene expression pattern, we conclude TOCP to mediate endocrine effects on MCF-7 cells by interacting with ER??. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",

CFRP hat-shaped and angle-shaped stiffeners were used to develop a double-hat collapsible energy absorption system. Three different design alternatives were investigated. The first alternative is an open-cell design (OC) consisting of two flipped hat stiffeners with four right angles on the edges. The second alternative is a one-in-cell double-hat design (1C), consisting of OC design with additional one inside small hat stiffeners edged with angles. The third alternative is a two-in-cell double-hat design (2C), consisting of OC design with additional two inside small hat stiffeners edged with angles. Three modes of failure were observed, classified as local buckling (mode I), top wall bending (mode II), and brittle collapse that resulted from Euler buckling (mode III). The crashworthiness characteristics were evaluated for the three designs. The 2C double-hat design showed the highest peak load and specific energy absorption (SEA). Accordingly, the core of the 2C design was filled with foam to increase the energy absorption capability and enhance the structure's stability. Results showed that the SEA of the 2C+ foam design was increased by more than 50% compared to the coreless 2C double-hat design. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Quasi-static compressive response including failure deformation modes of TPC CSPs were experimentally and numerically investigated to reveal the effect of layer numbers and core configurations namely regular, perpendicular and symmetrical. For two-layered CSPs, core layers of the regular configuration panels were firstly compressed to overlapping and then failed together, core layers of the perpendicular ones failed step by step. But for the symmetrical configuration, assembly deviations were found to affect the deformation modes sensitively by comparing the experimental and numerical results. Among three configurations, the perpendicular one has the optimal specific energy absorption (SEA) and crushing force efficiency (CFE), while the regular one has the biggest peak crushing force (PCF).

However, millions of people are still without basic water services, predominantly in rural areas in developing nations. Previous studies have investigated the environmental impacts of water provision, but they mostly focused on large-scale urban systems. This paper considers for the first time the life cycle environmental impacts of different water supply options applicable to remote communities in developing countries. Focusing on the Southeast Asia-Pacific (SEAP) context, a cradle-to-grave approach is followed to estimate the impacts of locally-sourced groundwater, surface water and desalinated seawater as well as externally-sourced bottled water. The results reveal that surface water is environmentally the most sustainable alternative. Locally desalinated water, powered by diesel electricity, has two orders of magnitude higher impacts than surface water. However, externally-sourced water in plastic bottles is the worst option with 4?€?155 times higher impacts than desalinated water and up to three orders of magnitude higher impacts than surface water. This is largely due to the impacts related to the production of bottles. Doubling their recycling would reduce the impacts by 7?€?23% but bottled water would still be environmentally the least sustainable option. Although water in single-use bottles currently provides only 3% of the water supply of a representative remote community in the SEAP region considered in this study, it accounts on average for more than 50% of the total impacts from water consumption. By 2030, population increase could lead to greater reliance of remote communities on bottled water and 60?€?73% higher impacts of water consumption per household. Relying solely on local surface, ground and water desalinated using solar power and avoiding bottled water would reduce the impacts by 33?€?99% relative to the current situation. This would also improve considerably water availability and security in remote communities. The findings of this study will be of interest to national and local governments developing future policies aimed at increasing access of remote communities to clean water. ?? 2020 The Authors",

However, clean-up activities on such accumulation regions are limited by the spread of the large-size floating litter on the sea surface. Data gathered by a small-scale fishing vessel devoted to active fishing for floating litter activities during the spring and summer of 2018 reveals that the linear streaks of high concentration of floating litter (so-called litter ?€?windrows?€?) are common accumulation structures in the south-east coast of the Bay of Biscay. The random search of litter windrows for their collection through surface tows of macro-nets was proved to be an effective action for floating litter mitigation. A total of 196 tows collected 16.2 tons of floating marine litter in 68 working days. Most of the litter windrows were around 1 km length and, on average, accumulated 77.75 kg of floating marine litter. Fishing, shipping and aquaculture sectors were the source of 35% of the 4,130 litter items analyzed (55% in weight of the sourced items), and plastic was the most common type of material (96% in terms of items). A better understanding of the phenomenon of the litter windrows, capable to guide clean-up efforts in space and time, would provide a considerable improvement in the efficiency of mitigation actions to reduce the marine litter pollution. The observations of litter windrows in the coastal area of the south-east of the Bay of Biscay demonstrate the key role of submesoscale processes in the distribution of FML. The present work provides a thorough description of floating litter windrows in nature, which it was non-existent to date. The results are the kind of proof necessary to boost the research addressed on the submesoscale aggregations of FML. Coupling litter windrows observations with remote-sensing technology and high-resolution modeling techniques offer great opportunities for the mitigation actions against marine litter. ??

This study evaluated the effects of Typhoon Mangkhut (7?€?18 September 2018) on marine debris pollution including macro-debris (&gt;2.5 cm) and microplastics (5 ??m?€?5 mm) in Hong Kong. Sampling was repeated on four beaches, two each from protected and exposed coastal areas, spanning from the eastern to western waters before and after the cyclone. For macro-debris, an average density of 0.047 items m???2 and 0.54 items m???2 was obtained before and after the cyclone, respectively or an 11.4-fold increase, with plastic being the most dominant type (61.9?€?93.3% and 80.7?€?92.4% before and after the cyclone, respectively) among total beached debris in all four beaches. Likewise, higher mean microplastic abundances were found in the post-cyclone period (335 items kg???1 sediment) when compared with the pre-cyclone period (188 items kg???1 sediment). The depositional dynamics for both macro-debris and microplastic were site-specific due to factors such as wind direction and the associated storm surge, topography and orientation of the site, and proximity to urban areas. This study has demonstrated the role cyclone induced overwash plays on introducing plastic pollution to beach environments. Considering an increase in both the intensity and frequency of cyclone in the future due to global warming, and a tremendous increase in marine plastic debris, more research effort should be spent on this understudied problem. ?? 2020",

They are consumed at a staggering rate worldwide, with the UK alone consuming around 7 million cups daily, thus annually producing around 30,000 tonnes of paper cup waste. Contrary to popular belief, less than 1 in 400 paper cups is currently recycled in the UK, which is in stark contrast to the waste hierarchy and the European Commission's ambitious Circular Economy Action Plan. Paper cups typically end up in landfill sites or even improperly disposed of, contributing to (micro)plastic waste and potentially polluting the world's oceans. The implications of the latter are not fully known yet and cannot be quantified by existing life cycle impact assessment methods. By employing the life cycle assessment methodology, UK's annual carbon footprint from paper cup consumption was found to be 75 kt of carbon dioxide equivalents, which is similar to that of manufacturing 11,500 mid-size passenger cars. Globally, their environmental footprint was found to be comparable to that of some 1.5 M average European inhabitants, indicating the nature and extent of the single-use plastics problem, which paper cups are just a typical example of. Paper cup recycling could reduce this environmental footprint by up to 40%, whereas switching to reusable cups appears to be more environmentally sustainable, achieving a threefold reduction in carbon emissions, which at global scale is more than twice Malta's annual carbon footprint. Results indicate that consumerism along with small daily choices, such as using reusable cups or bags instead of their disposable counterparts, could play a huge role in climate change. At policy level, no concrete measures to curb the superfluous consumption of paper cups, as well as of other single-use plastic items that are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, have materialised. Furthermore, it appears that decision- and policy-makers tend to step in to curtail wasteful and polluting practices only when environmental problems have started to generate widespread concern, instead of undertaking preventative policy measures. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
Z9L432VB,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120174,The flowing of microplastics was accelerated under the influence of artificial flood generated by hydropower station,"Rivers are considered the most important channel for microplastics traveling to the ocean from inland. The Yellow River is one of a main microplastics source for the Bohai Sea. As hydropower station operations?€?especially the artificial flood pulse?€?could significantly affect the transportation processes of microplastics, it is necessary to investigate the transportation regulation of microplastics from the Yellow River to the estuary. In this study, the distribution of microplastics (across 10 sections of the river from Xiaolangdi to the estuary) was detected at three stages (the pre-, inter-, and post-artificial flooding season). The result showed that the microplastic concentrations in the Yellow River ranged from 0.105 to 1.17 items m???2. The main microplastic shapes found were foam and film, and the main components were expanded polystyrene and polyethylene. The average particle sizes were 1101.54, 484.93, and 509.46 ??m at the three stages, respectively. The artificial flood accelerated the transport of microplastics from inland to the estuary and ocean; it also unified the overall particle size of microplastics along the river. The microplastics in the surface water of the study area likely originate mostly upstream of the Xiaolangdi Hydropower Station. The artificial flooding generated from water and sediment regulation transports a large amount of microplastics in the reservoirs and river channels to the estuary and offshore areas in a short time period via artificial flooding. ?? 2020",

The importance of this application relies on the current use of marine organisms as bioindicators for microplastic contamination through the detection of phthalates in their tissues. Challenges originate from the availability and/or possible restriction on the use of the biological materials, the need for user- friendly procedures for simplifying and speeding up operations in the marine environments, and the ubiquitous presence of phthalates in the laboratory environments that may cause background contamination. BioSPME served as an effective solution to all these issues, owing to the extreme minimization of the sample manipulation. Sampling operations were limited to the direct transfer of small amounts of the biological materials (150 mg) inside glass vials capped with aluminium lids; extractions were carried out by ultrasonication in acetone followed by dilution in ultrapure water and BioSPME clean-up; Electrospray (ESI) LC?€?MS/MS was employed for the final analytical determinations on the purified extracts. Tests were carried out on samples belonging to three different phyla, namely Cnidaria, Porifera, and Mollusca obtained from Maldivian coral reef environments and used for a current microplastic contamination biomonitoring project. Overall, very good sensitivity and repeatability, with negligible back contamination of the blanks were observed. The limits of detections were between 0.2 and 2.1 ng/g and precision, calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD), was below 14% for all the tested phthalates. ?? 2020",

MP fluxes change markedly through time and space in both river systems. However, no clear relationships between MP concentrations and hydroclimatic conditions have been observed. In the Rh??ne River a non-linear dilution pattern of MPs in total suspended matter (TSM) during flood conditions could be observed. Although dilution is important, samples during floods exert a strong control on average MP fluxes. Compared to the Rh??ne River, average MP concentrations in the T??t River were throughout greater and more variable in shape and polymer composition. However, as the study year was exceptionally dry, the average specific MP flux, 76 g km??? 2 y??? 1, is only slightly larger than the non-flooding value of the Rh??ne River. We further monitored MP concentrations in shoreline sediments at the mouth of the T??t River to test whether these sediments can represent MP transport in the river. Besides fibers, which probably are easily washed out and transported offshore, MP concentrations and compositions are in agreement with MP loads upstream the river. We also examined the potential role of atmospheric deposition as a source of MP to the T??t River. The average atmospheric MP deposition of 6 kg km??? 2 y??? 1 exceeds by far the river average specific MP flux. Moreover, all MPs in atmospheric deposits were fibers, which in terms of mass are of minor importance in the bulk river fluxes. Atmospheric MP deposits may either have been overestimated and/or may be removed from surface waters by efficient removal processes (such as waste water treatment plants). ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Here, we explored the microbial assemblages associated with different types of plastic debris collected from two coastal sites in the Mediterranean Sea. All plastic samples were heavily colonized by prokaryotes, with abundances up to 1.9 ?? 107 cells/cm2. Microbial assemblages on plastics significantly differed between the two geographic areas but not between polymer types, suggesting a major role of the environment as source for the plastisphere composition. Nevertheless, plastic communities differed from those in the surrounding seawater and sediments, indicating a further selection of microbial taxa on the plastic substrates. The presence of potential pathogens on the plastic surface reflected the levels of microbial pollution in the surrounding environment, regardless of the polymer type, and confirmed the role of plastics as carriers for pathogenic microorganisms across the coastal ocean, deserving further investigations. ??

Recent studies have identified MP in the terrestrial atmospheric environment. However, the connection between terrigenous atmospheric MP emissions and impacts over the ocean is not well known. Here, we present the distribution of atmospheric MP abundance over the ocean based on a transoceanic survey conducted across 21 sampling transects from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) to the South China Sea (SCS) and then to the East Indian Ocean (EIO). The abundance of atmospheric MP over the PRE (4.2 ?? 2.5 items/100 m3) was significantly higher than that over the EIO (0.4 ?? 0.6 items/100 m3). However, the abundance of atmospheric MP in the SCS (0.8 ?? 1.3 items/100 m3) was not significantly different from the EIO and PRE. This result revealed that MP undergoes long-range transport, more than 1000 km away, through the atmosphere, but atmospheric MP transmission as the main source of oceanic MP based on transoceanic studies is not a plausible assumption. Furthermore, backward trajectory model analysis of 21 sampling transects preliminary showed the potential sources of atmospheric MP over the PRE, SCS, and EIO. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

These microplastics eventually build up in the marine environment, threatening marine ecosystems. The magnitude, fate and effects of these microplastics across the food web are largely unknown. Here, we measured digested microplastics in a top predator and critically endangered species, the North-East Atlantic Porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus), and compared this with general health conditions. A method for quantifying microplastics in spiral valves of porbeagle sharks was developed. Microplastics were detected in all spiral valves, up to 10.4 particles per g wet weight (w.w.) content and 9.5 particles per g w.w. tissue. This equates to individual microplastics loads as high as 3850 particles per spiral valve, most likely a result of trophic transfer. No statistically significant correlations were found between the average number of plastic particles in spiral valve content and tissue and the Condition and Hepatosomatic Index of porbeagle sharks. The results of this research show that North-East Atlantic porbeagle sharks ingest and digest microplastics and that there is a potential for microplastic biomonitoring using this species. More research is needed to detect possible health effects of microplastic contamination in these apex predators. ??

DAJJYDYG,10.5194/tc-14-1449-2020,A model for French-press experiments of dry snow compaction,"Snow densification stores water in alpine regions and transforms snow into ice on the surface of glaciers. Despite its importance in determining snow-water equivalent and glacier-induced sea level rise, we still lack a complete understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying snow compaction. In essence, compaction is a rheological process, where the rheology evolves with depth due to variation in temperature, pressure, humidity, and meltwater. The rheology of snow compaction can be determined in a few ways, for example, through empirical investigations (e.g., Herron and Langway, 1980), by microstructural considerations (e.g., Alley, 1987), or by measuring the rheology directly, which is the approach we take here. Using a <q>French-press</q> or <q>cafeti??re-??-piston</q> compression stage, Wang and Baker (2013) compressed numerous snow samples of different densities. Here we derive a mixture theory for compaction and airflow through the porous snow to compare against these experimental data. We find that a plastic compaction law explains experimental results. Taking standard forms for the permeability and effective pressure as functions of the porosity, we show that this compaction mode persists for a range of densities and overburden loads. These findings suggest that measuring compaction in the lab is a promising direction for determining the rheology of snow through its many stages of densification. ?? 2020 American Medical Association.

To quantify the distribution and polymer types temporally, sediment cores were collected from &gt;2000 m water depth in the Rockall Trough, North Atlantic Ocean. As hypothesized, a significant negative trend was observed in the frequency of microplastics with increasing sediment age, however there was an increase in polymer diversity. Microplastics were pervasive throughout the sediment analysed (10 cm depth), yet lead-210 (210Pb) activities were confined to the upper 4 cm, indicating this layer to be 150 years old and thus the presence of microplastics far exceed the production of modern plastic. A number of mechanisms, including sediment reworking, could redistribute microplastics vertically.

B8Z4Q26Q,10.1016/j.envint.2020.105655,Destination of floating plastic debris released from ten major rivers around the Korean Peninsula,Using a Lagrangian particle tracking model the coastal accumulation of debris from 10 major Chinese and Korean rivers discharging to the seas around the Korean Peninsula is investigated. The amount of debris from each river is proportional to the population over the catchment area of the river and the mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) ratio of the country the river belongs to. The debris generally washes up on the coast near the originating river mouth. When only the debris originating from the rivers on the Korean Peninsula is considered the model results are consistent with the observations for the Korean coast reported in previous studies in that the amount of microplastic and macroplastic are greater near the Han and Nakdong Rivers. The amount of debris from Chinese rivers calculated based on the MPW ratios is 75 times greater than that from the rivers on the Korean Peninsula and if the Chinese rivers are added the model the results differ from the observed patterns. Macroplastic distribution also exhibits a similar discrepancy between the model and observation results if debris from the Chinses Rivers are taken into account. Observed data from Korea's Marine Litter Information System show that the accumulation of foreign-originating macroplastic most of which is Chinese is highest around the southwestern corner of the Korean Peninsula. Debris from the Chinese Yangtze and Yellow Rivers reproduces this observed distribution. Based on the observational data more debris originates from Korea than from foreign sources but Chinese-originating debris is dominant in the model. There are two possibilities for this discrepancy. The first is the presence of sinking due to biofouling; if 50% of the plastic sinks every 20 days or so the model results become similar to the observations. The second is the large difference in the MPW ratios between China and Korea employed in the model. Reducing the Chinese MPW ratio to 25% or lower the model results more closely reflect the observations made along the Korean coast. ?? 2020 The Authors,
SMKL4LA7,10.1371/journal.pone.0232746,Examination of the ocean as a source for atmospheric microplastics,"Global plastic litter pollution has been increasing alongside demand since plastic products gained commercial popularity in the 1930?€?s. Current plastic pollutant research has generally assumed that once plastics enter the ocean they are there to stay, retained permanently within the ocean currents, biota or sediment until eventual deposition on the sea floor or become washed up onto the beach. In contrast to this, we suggest it appears that some plastic particles could be leaving the sea and entering the atmosphere along with sea salt, bacteria, virus?€? and algae. This occurs via the process of bubble burst ejection and wave action, for example from strong wind or sea state turbulence. In this manuscript we review evidence from the existing literature which is relevant to this theory and follow this with a pilot study which analyses microplastics (MP) in sea spray. Here we show first evidence of MP particles, analysed by ??Raman, in marine boundary layer air samples on the French Atlantic coast during both onshore (average of 2.9MP/m3) and offshore (average of 9.6MP/ m3) winds. Notably, during sampling, the convergence of sea breeze meant our samples were dominated by sea spray, increasing our capacity to sample MPs if they were released from the sea. Our results indicate a potential for MPs to be released from the marine environment into the atmosphere by sea-spray giving a globally extrapolated figure of 136000 ton/yr blowing on shore. ?? 2020 Allen et al.

In this study, we investigated the influence of an active microbial community grown on microplastic particles (the plastisphere) on CO2 and N2O recycling and its potential role in greenhouse gas inventories and air-sea exchange. Microplastics were collected during two cruises (Cimar 21 and FIP Montes Submarinos) from the surface layer (5 m depth) from several contrasting trophic regions of the South Pacific Ocean, i.e., from a transition zone off the eutrophic coastal upwelling of Chile, to a mesotrophic transition area of oceanic seamounts and, finally, to an oligotrophic zone in the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Experiments were carried out onboard to evaluate CO2 and N2O production/consumption by the plastisphere. The active microbial community and its specific quantification were determined for Cimar 21 using iTag 16 S rRNA. The experiments showed that the plastisphere generally contributed to CO2 and N2O production/consumption, with rates ranging from ???20.5 (consumption) to +4.5 (production) ??mol/m2/d. The seamounts and the transition zone presented the highest production/consumption rates. The experiments performed in the two seamount stations showed that production and consumption of CO2 were related to the environmental nutrient concentration. Both stations presented N2O consumption that was associated with the high nitrogen deficit of the subantarctic water mass. The transition zone presented CO2 and N2O production in a plastisphere dominated by heterotrophic communities. The plastisphere in oligotrophic waters was diverse and active. The experiments, however, presented low or no production of greenhouse gases. Our results show a contribution of CO2 and N2O to the global gas surface inventories and air-sea exchange is lower than 1% of the global sources.

It is important to note that of the 447 microparticles analyzed with RMS, 41% showed fluorescence interference, impeding the determination of their identification. The remaining microparticles were cellulose derivatives, shell fragments, biological or proteinaceous material, salts, minerals, and gypsum.

ERTQUTQR,10.1007/s11356-020-07833-1,Plastic driven pollution in Pakistan: the first evidence of environmental exposure to microplastic in sediments and water of Rawal Lake,"Microplastic pollution is as an emerging environmental threat. Focus of most of the current researches has been on microplastics in the marine environment. However, there is limited information for microplastic availability in the fresh water, especially in Pakistan. The current study was conducted with the objective of investigating the microplastic presence and concentration in the surface water and sediments of the Rawal Lake, in the capital city of Pakistan. The average microplastic abundance for water and sediments was 0.142 items/0.1 L and 1.04 items/0.01 kg, respectively. Results indicated that the fibers and fragments were the most dominant types of microplastics. The dominant colors were blue, red, black, and transparent. FTIR analysis of visible microplastic particles displayed a greater similarity with polyethylene, polypropylene, polyesters, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyvinyl chloride because of the appearance of characteristic peaks of these polymers. The study also revealed greater concentration of microplastics in the sediments as compared with water of the Rawal Lake. High population density surrounding lake, improper waste disposal, tourism, and recreational activities may be the major reasons for the microplastic contamination of the lake. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

The occurrence of microplastics in four species of barnacles at 30 sites in Hong Kong waters was investigated. The median number of microplastics ranged between 0 and 8.63 particles g???1 wet weight, or 0 and 1.9 particles individual???1, with fibers being the most abundant type of microplastics. The chemical composition of 152 pieces out of 606 potential microplastics was analyzed using micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (??-FTIR). Fifty-two of them were synthetic polymers, 95 natural cotton fibers and five unknowns. Eight types of polymer were identified with cellophane being the most abundant (58%). Correlation analysis was conducted between the abundance of MPs in sediments obtained in our previous study and that in individual barnacle species in this study, and a positive correlation was established for the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite, highlighting the potential of using this species as a bioindicator of microplastics. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In contrast, the impact of microplastic pollution in freshwater environments was understudied, e.g., only a few studies examined the amount and distribution of microplastic in rivers, as well as the contribution of rivers to the microplastic pollution in oceans. In this study we investigated the microplastic pollution in the Tamsui River and its tributaries in northern Taiwan. We collected samples with a manta net from the Tamsui River, the Dahan River, the Keelung River and the Xindian River every two weeks over a time period of three months in 2018. Additionally, we took samples from the Xindian River during a heavy rain event in February 2019. Microplastic particles in the size range of 0.3?€?5 mm were visually identified. Unknown particles were identified using FTIR spectroscopy. The extracted particles were counted and classified according to their shape and color. We found microplastic of varying amounts in each of the samples, which indicates a wide spread pollution in the Tamsui River and its tributaries. The amount varies between rivers and ranges in average from 2.5 ?? 1.8 particles per m3 in the Xindian River to 83.7 ?? 70.8 particles per m3 in the Dahan River. Our data shows a positive correlation between precipitation and amount of microplastic particles found in the rivers. Moreover, in each river we could observe a large spatial and temporal variation of the microplastic amount between the left, middle and right sections of the stream. Due to this heterogeneous distribution of particles, we suggest that samples for microplastic analysis should be taken from multiple places across a river, as well as over a certain period to account for the heterogeneous microplastic distribution in the river water. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Therefore, we analyzed samples from 17 sites to evaluate the distribution pattern of microplastics (MPs) in Minjiang River Watershed. The MP concentrations ranged between 0.12 and 2.72 n/L, with higher microplastic concentrations located in urban areas with greater population and gross domestic product (GDP) densities. MP concentrations were positively correlated with population density, GDP density, and built-up land use percentage, suggesting that increasing urbanization level will lead to greater plastic pollution. MP concentrations spanning the upstream and downstream sides of the SK Hydropower Dam showed decreasing trends, suggesting that MP settling would occur behind the dam and Shuikou Reservoir might serve as a sink for MPs. This study provides useful insight for revealing the effects of urbanization and dams on spatial distribution of riverine MPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Marine medaka Oryzias melastigma embryos and larvae were exposed to suspended MPs spiked with three model contaminants: benzo(a)pyrene (MP-BaP), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (MP-PFOS) and benzophenone-3 (MP-BP3) for 12 days. There was no evidence of MPs ingestion but MPs agglomerated on the surface of the chorion. Fish ELS exposed to virgin MPs did not show toxic effects. Exposure to MP-PFOS decreased embryonic survival and prevented hatching. Larvae exposed to MP-BaP or MP-BP3 exhibited reduced growth, increased developmental anomalies and abnormal behavior. Compared to equivalent waterborne concentrations, BaP and PFOS appeared to be more embryotoxic when spiked on MPs than when alone in seawater. These results suggest a relevant pollutant transfer by direct contact of MPs to fish ELS that should be included in the ecotoxicological risk assessment of MPs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

This study was carried out to determine the litter and MP in surface sand samples in a highly urbanized coastal environment of Cagayan de Oro in Macajalar Bay, Philippines. The flotation and stereomicroscope identification methods were employed to study MP, while litters were counted to extrapolate the clean coast index (CCI). Overall, MP fibers were found ubiquitously with site-specific abundance. Particularly, the residential site adjacent to the river mouth had the highest litter and MP fiber counts. The built environment like the seaport showed fragmented forms of MP. Likewise, CCI analysis showed an extremely dirty beachfront (CCI = 85) which mainly caused by plastic litters.

Evidence of its occurrence and abundance, has been recorded in this communication after examining gastrointestinal specimens of eight commercially available fish species common to the Arabian (Persian) Gulf acquired locally from the State of Kuwait. The species studied belonged to different trophic levels, and the specimens were subjected to Micro Raman and Micro Fourier Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) in Attenuated Reflective Mode (ATR) to determine the presence and type of polymer of the MP. The detected MP set a president for the first time in the examined fish species within the State of Kuwait, which are of immense commercial importance. Various particles were detected, and three MP particles (fragments) were detected within the guts of Acanthopagrus latus, Eleutheronemaa tetradactylum and Lutjanus quinquelineatus. Based on the nature and behaviour of these particular fish types which prefer to stay in muddy waters and sheltered lagoons, it is suspected that common primary sources of MP (i.e. waste fragmentation) have led to passive/active intake (e.g. detritus ingestion) of these particles (fragments) by these species of fish in Kuwait. ?? 2020",

We investigated plastic consumption in sea anemones. We found that anemones readily consumed pristine National Institute of Standards and Technology low-density polyethylene and high-density polyethylene II and III pre-production pellets. Anemone weight, crown area, and number of tentacles were measured before and after 12 days of daily pellet consumption. Crown area significantly increased for control anemones only. Fresh anemones were then sequentially fed consumed and egested pellets from two of the earlier daily trials to measure feeding retention time, which decreased over three to four feedings. The concentrations of elements in anemones (zinc, iron, arsenic, manganese, chromium, copper, vanadium, selenium, nickel, cadmium, and cobalt) were similar to control anemones that were not exposed to pellets. Lead concentrations were significantly higher in anemones fed HDPE III pellets as compared to control. Plastic consumption by marine animals might be reduced by reducing the amount of plastic that enters the ocean and understanding the chemical triggers underlying plastic consumption. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Previous research indicated that large polyethylene microbeads were abundant in the freshwater sediments of the St. Lawrence River. Here we extend this work by quantifying the abundance of a broad range of sizes and types of microplastics in sediments and surface water samples, and we relate these metrics to environmental variables. We sampled 21 sites for sediments that spanned a land use gradient, and 10 surface water stations above and below wastewater effluent sites, along the fluvial corridor of the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City from July to August 2017. Microplastics were removed from sediments using an oil extraction protocol and enumerated under fluorescent microscopy. We tested predictions that environmental filters and known point sources affect microplastic concentrations in the river. The mean concentration of microplastics across all sediment sampling sites was 832 (??150 SE) plastics per kg dry weight (range 65?€?7562 plastics per kg dry weight), which is among the highest recorded (in the top 25%) for the world's freshwater and marine systems. Microplastic concentrations in the sediments were significantly related to a suite of environmental variables including land use and sediment particle characteristics. Particle characteristics, proximity to point sources (urban land use), and environmental filters (sediment compositional variables, % organic carbon, % inorganic carbon and distance from shore) each explained a significant fraction of variation in the microplastic composition in the sediment, with environmental filters having the greatest influence.

DJIVBUTL,,Microplastics reduce the growth of exposed marine invertebrates: A meta-analysis,"There is a need for a quantitative approach to ascertain whether microplastic pollutants functionally affect exposed organisms. This meta-analysis aimed to determine if microplastics reduce the mean growth of exposed aquatic invertebrates in the marine environment. Twelve studies investigating microplastic exposure were submitted to meta-analytic techniques to obtain the overall combined effect. The random effects model was used. Standardized mean difference in growth was reported as Hedges?€? g value. The robustness of the data was confirmed through a leave-one-out method of sensitivity analysis. Results shown by forest plot suggested that overall, the samples exposed to microplastics had lesser mean length after the exposure period as compared to samples not treated with microplastics. Mean difference in growth was equal to-1.324, as given by standardized Hedges?€? g. A sensitivity analysis using leave-one-out method further showed that the data were robust, confirming overall reduction in growth. Growth reduction could be attributed to the size-selective ingestion of microplastics by the organisms, whereby they ingest smaller microplastic particles more readily than larger ones. Ingestion and egestion of microplastic particles entail an energetic cost for organisms, consequently reducing energy devoted to growth. The findings showed that microplastics can negatively influence the growth and eventually the overall well-being of marine organisms. ?? 2020, Faculty of Fisheries, Kasetsart University.

A short review is first provided on the use of bivalves for biomonitoring MPs in aquatic ecosystems. From the conclusions drawn from our review we determine if the sediment dwelling varnish and Manila clam could possibly be good choices for this purpose. We sampled 8 intertidal sites located within two distinct regions of coastal British Columbia, Burrard Inlet (5 sites) and Baynes Sound (3 sites). Each intertidal region had its own particular use; within Burrard Inlet, BMP a heavily used marine park, CP, EB, J, and AP, popular local beaches, and within Baynes Sound, Met and NHB, two intertidal regions heavily exploited by the shellfish industry and RU an intertidal region with limited aquaculture activity. Microfragments were recovered from bivalves collected from all intertidal regions except for AP. Microspheres were recovered primarily from bivalves sampled from Baynes Sound at NHB where high numbers of spheres within sediments had previously been reported. BMP and Met had the highest number of particles present within individual clams which were predominantly high density polyethylene (HDPE) and a polypropylene composite (PPC). Both polymers are extensively used by the shellfish industry in all gear types, as well as in industrial and recreational marine activities. The spatial distribution of recovered MPs was indicative of the anthropogenic use of the intertidal region suggesting these bivalves, for microfragments and microspheres, may be suitable as biomonitors and could prove to be useful tools for determining whether reduction policies for plastics use are having a positive effect on their release into marine environments. ?? 2020 Bendell et al.

However, data on epiplastic organisms, particularly fungi, is still lacking for many ocean regions. To evaluate plastic associated fungi and their geographic distribution, we characterised plastics sampled from surface waters of the western South Atlantic (WSA) and Antarctic Peninsula (AP), using DNA metabarcoding of three molecular markers (ITS2, 18S rRNA V4 and V9 regions). Numerous taxa from eight fungal phyla and a total of 64 orders were detected, including groups that had not yet been described associated with plastics. There was a varied phylogenetic assemblage of predominantly known saprotrophic taxa within the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota.

The results showed that the CAT activity, SOD activity, MDA content and the relative ROS level reached to 377 U mgprot???1, 164 U mgprot???1, 157 nmol mgprot???1 and 10.8% when treated with 10 mg L???1 PS of 65 nm diameter; the CAT activity, SOD activity and MDA content in single K. mikimotoi reached to 0.46 U mgprot???1, 0.36 U mgprot???1 and 0.16 nmol mgprot???1 under 10 mg L???1 PS of 65 nm diameter on the third day. The relative ROS level in single K. mikimotoi was 71% under 10 mg L???1 PS of 100 nm diameter on the 13th day. The works found that the size of nano/micro-PS was a key factor that cannot be ignored. Smaller size had more serious negative effects on the growth, oxidative stress and cell microstructure. The potential cytotoxicity mechanisms were that monodisperse nanoscaled PS crossed the biological barriers and the agglomerate nanoparticles caused physical blockage, while microscaled PS may not have such an equally strong negative effects. Visualized SEM images also proved that exposing to nano/micro-PS of varies diameters led to apparent size-dependent effects.

The median lethal concentration obtained for CPF was higher (LC50 = 1.34 ??g/L) than for the combination with MP (LC50 = 0.37 ??g/L), or CPF-loaded MP (LC50 = 0.26 ??g/L). Significant effects were also observed for feeding and egg production (EC50 = 0.77 and 1.07 ??g/L for CPF, 0.03 and 0.05 ??g/L for CPF combined with MP, 0.18 and 0.20 ??g/L for CPF-loaded MP). No significant effects were observed in the exposure to ?€?virgin?€? MP. This study confirms the role of MP as vectors of pollutants to marine organisms and supports the increased availability of certain toxicants carried out by MP. The effects observed in fitness-related responses suggest potential damage to A. tonsa populations.

Oysters as seafood are popular worldwide, yet also a high-risk group to accumulate pollutants due to their filter-feeding nature. In this study, edible oysters were collected from Yantai, a coastal city in China, to study the uptake, accumulation and translocation of microplastics in marine life, as well as their in vivo interactions with other persistent pollutants. Microplastics were found in all of the studied oyster tissue samples with an average concentration around 4.53 items/g wet weight (24.49 items/g dry weight). Microplastics were mainly translocated and distributed in the gills and mantle of the studied oysters in the form of fibers. The detected microplastics in the oysters were mostly cellophane and polyester as identified by the micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscope. Cellophane tends to accumulate in gills, mantle and muscle while polyester tends to accumulate in digestive glands of the studied oysters. Excessive concentrations of trace metals (30.484, 4.415, 0.395 and 181.044 ??g/g dry weight of Cr, Cd, Pb and Cu, respectively) were detected in the studied oysters using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Trace metals of Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb were found to be adsorbed on the surface of microplastics isolated from the oysters. There was a correlation between the in vivo concentration of microplastics and the in vivo concentration of four trace metals: Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb, which suggests potential in vivo interactions between microplastics and trace metals. This study can help to understand the impacts of microplastics and their joint toxicity with other pollutants on marine life, especially on aquaculture seafood.

EUV3USMW,10.3390/su12093746,Sustainability assessment of a single-use plastics ban,"Governments around the world are introducing single-use plastics bans to alleviate plastic marine pollution. This paper investigates whether banning single-use plastic items is an appropriate strategy to protect the environment. Product life cycle assessment was conducted for single-use plastic and single-use non-plastic alternatives. The life cycle impacts of the two product categories were compared and scaled according to EU consumption of 2016. The results show that a single-use plastics ban would decrease plastic marine pollution in the EU by 5.5% which equates to a 0.06% decrease globally. However, such a ban would increase emissions contributing to marine aquatic toxicity in the EU by 1.4%. This paper concludes that single-use items are harmful to the environment regardless of their material. Therefore, banning or imposing a premium price on single-use items in general and not only single-use plastic items is a more effective method of reducing consumption and thereby pollution. The plastics ban only leads to a small reduction of global plastic marine pollution and thus provides only a partial solution to the problem it intends to solve. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

The Ocean Cleanup is testing a method to passively collect this floating plastic debris, transport, recycle, process and sell it. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate alternative logistics chains to accommodate ocean plastic waste recycling by connecting transport with data collection and data analytics. The scenarios are based on different geographical destinations, supply chain lengths and types, and offered local development opportunities. A new reverse logistics channel dedicated to the Ocean Cleanup is developed, as existing reverse logistics supply chains are not able to capture the specifics of the plastic waste collection. Performances of the different scenarios are assessed by collecting data (on plastic volumes collected from the Ocean, on usage of plastics as a resource, and on transport cost) and usage of a detailed integrated model which enables a performance comparison of different logistical structures on logistics costs and on plastics production outputs. The cheapest and most disappointing solution would be to do nothing. However, the analysis shows that more complicated logistic structures whereby the collected plastic waste is used to produce glasses, socks, and carpets can lead to sustainable business models for cleaning up the Oceans. If the focus would be only on cost, the best model would be to minimize the transport distance and focus on San Francisco as closest port for the selected gyre to be analyzed. ?? 2020 The Authors",

The present study investigates the effect of a 24 h experimental exposure to high density polyethylene (HDPE) microplastics (MPs) of different sizes (4?€?6, 11?€?13 and 20?€?25 ??m) and at three concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 mg MP.L???1) on the development and locomotor activity of early stages of Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The bivalve embryo-larval assay (NF ISO 17244, 2015) was used in this study but with additional toxicity criteria: developmental arrests, abnormal D-larvae, maximum speed and swimming trajectory. Copper (Cu), was used as a positive control. Our results show that smaller MPs (4?€?6 and 11?€?13 ??m) induced higher rates of malformations and developmental arrests than the larger ones (20?€?25 ??m). In addition, a dose-dependent decrease of maximum swimming speed was observed for larvae exposed to MPs of 4?€?6 and 11?€?13 ??m. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in swimming speed with the largest MPs size tested (20?€?25 ??m). For all three sizes of MPs, there was a decrease in straight-line swimming trajectories, and an increase in circular trajectories. This abnormal swimming behaviour could affect larvae survival as well as colonization of new habitats. Polyethylene microplastics of different sizes induce differential deleterious effects on development and swimming activity of oyster D-larvae. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
KXLD5AH2,10.1371/journal.pone.0228896,"Microplastics in Lake Mead National Recreation Area, USA: Occurrence and biological uptake","Microplastics are an environmental contaminant of growing concern, but there is a lack of information about microplastic distribution, persistence, availability, and biological uptake in freshwater systems. This is especially true for large river systems like the Colorado River that spans multiple states through mostly rural and agricultural land use. This study characterized the quantity and morphology of microplastics in different environmental compartments in two large reservoirs along the Colorado River: Lakes Mead and Mohave, within Lake Mead National Recreation Area. To assess microplastic occurrence, surface water and surficial sediment were sampled at a total of nine locations. Sampling locations targeted different sub-basins with varying levels of anthropogenic impact. Las Vegas Wash, a tributary which delivers treated wastewater to Lake Mead, was also sampled. A sediment core (33 cm long, representing approximately 19 years) was extracted from Las Vegas Bay to assess changes in microplastic deposition over time. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) were sampled at a subset of locations to assess biological uptake of microplastics. Microplastic concentrations were 0.44?€?9.7 particles/cubic meter at the water surface and 87.5?€?1,010 particles/kilogram dry weight (kg dw) at the sediment surface. Sediment core concentrations were 220?€?2,040 particles/kg dw, with no clear increasing or decreasing trend over time. Shellfish microplastic concentrations ranged from 2.7?€?105 particles/organism, and fish concentrations ranged from 0?€?19 particles/organism. Fibers were the most abundant particle type found in all sample types. Although sample numbers are small, microplastic concentrations appear to be higher in areas of greater anthropogenic impact.

The total abundance of plastics (???1?€?100 mm) in the studied beaches ranged from 4.1 to 23.4% (19??1?€?346 ?? 2 items/m2). Location-wise, the abundances of both micro (43.6 ?? 1.1?€?346 ?? 2 items/m2) and macroplastics (21.6??3?€?195 ?? 6 items/m2) were relatively higher in beaches along the Maharashtra coast. Surface morphology-wise, fragments were predominantly abundant in both micro (76??2?€?346 ?? 2 items/m2) and macroplastics (50.6 ?? 1.5?€?195 ?? 6 items/m2) followed by pellets (43.3 ?? 2.5?€?245.6 ?? 2 items/m2). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis of plastics revealed a dominance of polyethylene (PE) followed by polypropylene (PP). IR spectra of the collected plastics at absorption band at 1750?€?1700 cm???1 reflect minimal surface oxidation. White-colored plastics were observed most frequently, followed by pale-yellow, dark-brown, green, blue, transparent and red. A short-term (72 h) experimental study to assess the toxicity of PE microbeads (???1 mm) in a commercially important shrimp species, Litopenaeus vannamei revealed toxicological changes. An elevated level of lipid peroxidation (LPX)?€?the tagged biochemical marker, was recorded only at the maximum dose (0.15 mg/L) of PE microbeads. A moderate increase in the levels of enzymatic antioxidants (catalase and glutathione S-transferase) was also recorded at the same dose. Comprehensive information on marine plastics, including ecotoxicity provided in this study, would help in evolving strategies in minimizing plastic pollution along the WCI. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
6MYVNJ43,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110218,Naturally pre-designed biomaterials: Spider molting cuticle as a functional crude oil sorbent,"Diverse fields of modern environmental technology are nowadays focused on the discovery and development of new sources for oil spill removal. An especially interesting type of sorbents is those of natural origin?€?biosorbents?€?as ready-to-use constructs with biodegradable, nontoxic, renewable and cost-efficient properties. Moreover, the growing problem of microplastic-related contamination in the oceans further encourages the use of biosorbents. Here, for the first time, naturally pre-designed molting cuticles of the Theraphosidae spider Avicularia sp. ?€?Peru purple?€?, as part of constituting a large-scale spider origin waste material, were used for efficient sorption of crude oil. Compared with currently used materials, the proposed biosorbent of spider cuticular origin demonstrates excellent ability to remain on the water surface for a long time. In this study the morphology and hydrophobic features of Theraphosidae cuticle are investigated for the first time. The unique surface morphology and very low surface free energy (4.47 ?? 0.08 mN/m) give the cuticle-based, tube-like, porous biosorbent excellent oleophilic?€?hydrophobic properties. The crude oil sorption capacities of A. sp. ?€?Peru purple?€? molt structures in sea water, distilled water and fresh water were measured at 12.6 g/g, 15.8 g/g and 16.6 g/g respectively. These results indicate that this biomaterial is more efficient than such currently used fibrous sorbents as human hairs or chicken feathers. Four cycles of desorption were performed and confirmed the reusability of the proposed biosorbent. We suggest that the oil adsorption mechanism is related to the brush-like and microporous structure of the tubular spider molting cuticles and may also involve interaction between the cuticular wax layers and crude oil. ?? 2020",

Six samples of anthropoquinas were evaluated, presenting different technofossils (metal bottle caps, ship nail, plastic earring and plastic fragment) and composition (lithic and biogenic fragments). Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy was conducted on two samples, reflecting differences regarding their genesis. The description of these rocks is concerning and reflects how deeply human behavior influences various natural compartments.

It is a growing concern as an environmental pollutant, which currently has no clear detection standard. Detection methods still need to be constantly supplemented and improved. This study explored a novel method called time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) in this field. Four types of microplastics in farmland soils, namely, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyamide 6, were successfully identified in terms of particle size and abundance by combining the high molecular specificity with ion imaging capability of ToF-SIMS. The procedure based on ToF-SIMS analysis also provides a methodological reference and basic data for the investigation and research of microplastics in soil, coastal beaches, and sediment. ?? 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

This study presents a baseline dataset on the presence of plastic in the nests of five seabird species on Lady Isle, Scotland using a novel and repeatable methodology for quantifying plastic incorporated into nests. Plastic was found in 24.5% to 80% of nests of all species. We analysed pellets of regurgitated material and the spatial distribution of herring gull nests containing plastic in the context of the tide and nesting habitat. Differences in the types of plastic found in pellets and nests suggests that plastic incorporated into herring gull nests was not derived at foraging sites and likely collected from the local environment. Targeted beach cleans before the breeding season could help minimise the quantity of plastic available to herring gulls. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In doing so, the paper considers the technical and political challenges of building trust and equity for various stakeholders. A blockchain is a smart electronic database, distributed to all users, immutably tracking every transaction that has ever taken place on the network. The blockchain is very difficult to hack, with no single point of authority to make mistakes and collapse the system. Automated consensus protocols enable data transmitted on the network to be verified and stored immutably, minimising the risk of data corruption to near-zero. Blockchain is being increasingly hyped for a range of services and industries, including transparent resourcing for marine conservation, reducing pollution from plastics, reducing slavery at sea, and sustainable fisheries management. Public distrust in some conservation operations, as well as in the provenance of seafood, is growing. Although some global marine conservation organisations and seafood producers have found practical solutions in disruptive technologies like blockchain, riding this wave will only prove worthwhile if coastal communities and artisanal fishers are on board and stand a chance of landing a fair share of the benefits. ?? 2020",

Nine different formulations of marine antifouling coatings based on TiO2 and polyacrylate-g-polysiloxane were fabricated. The coatings had strong adhesion to substrate due to the incorporation of main-chain acrylic moieties. The side-chain Si?€?O bonds from polysiloxane enable the copolymer to hydrolytically degrade, and provide a self-polishing character and the low surface energy to the copolymer coating. The performance of nine formulations was evaluated, and the Y7 coating exhibited hydrophobic, 6H pencil hardness and5B cross-cut adhesion. The properties of the Y7 coatings are substrate-independent. Antibacterial test and cytotoxicity test were conducted to verify that nano-TiO2 particles inside marine antifouling coating inhibited bacterial growth and enhanced anti-bio adhesion. The results of marine field test inartificial sea waters for six months reveal that the side-chains polysiloxane leads to a self-polishing, low surface energy surface and a better antifouling property. ?? 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",

We highlight that percentage cover of biofouling organisms and capitulum length of Lepas anatifera are two methods that provide these estimates. Eight ghost nets were collected in the Maldives and estimated drift times ranged between 7.5 and 101 days. Additionally, Lagrangian simulations identified drift trajectories of 326 historical ghost nets records. Purse seine fisheries (associated with Korea, Mauritius, the Philippines, Spain, France and Seychelles) and gill nets from Sri Lanka were identified as 'high risk' fisheries with regard to likley origins of ghost nets drifting into the Maldives. These fisheries are active in areas where dense particle clusters occured (drift trajectories between 30 and 120 days). Interestingly, ghost nets drifting less than 30 days however, remained inside the exclusive economic zone of the Maldivian archipelago highlighting potential illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity is occuring in this area. This study therefore points to the urgent need for gear loss reporting to be undertaken, especially by purse seine and gill net fisheries in order to ascertain the source of this major threat to marine life. This should also be coupled with an improvment in the data focused on spatial distribution of the abandoned, lost or discarded fishing gear originating from both large- and small-scale fisheries. ?? 2020",

More than 80% of the marine debris was composed of synthetic materials. The beached marine debris was classified according to size. Meso-debris accounted for the highest portion of contamination (55%), followed by macro-debris (25.1%) and small debris (19.9%). Contamination by debris, such as cotton swabs (31%) and lollipop sticks (36.8%) accounted for the largest portion of the small debris class. Human recreational activities were the predominant source of debris, followed by navigation/fishing activities, domestic activities and industrial/port activities. The assessment of the predominance of human activities and the results of the model revealed a larger contribution of debris from recreational activities on nearby beaches on the small to larger scale and that rivers exert less of an influence due to the fact that they do not flow the entire year. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Interestingly, microplastics are always in their ageing process when they enter the real environment. Our study investigated the ageing properties of polystyrene (PS) plastics in air, pure water and seawater environments at 75 ??C. A two-dimensional (2D) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) correlation spectroscopy (COS) analysis was used to better understand the ageing mechanism of the PS plastics. Based on the 2D-COS analysis, different ageing mechanisms were identified under different ageing conditions, such as an ageing sequence of aged-PS particle functional groups in air: 1601(C[dbnd]C) > 1050(C?€?O)>1453(C?€?H)>1493(C?€?H)>1375(C?€?OH)>1666(C[dbnd]O). Among the functional group changes, O-functional groups (C?€?O, C?€?OH and C[dbnd]O) were introduced during the ageing process. Moreover, for pristine PS particles, hydrophobicity was a major factor for the interaction between the microplastics and organic pollutants. For aged-PS particles, their adsorption capacities were significantly enhanced as the degree of ageing increased. The ageing degree of PS was highly responsible for increasing of the specific surface area and the increase in oxygen-containing surface groups. Furthermore, there was a significant enhancement in the adsorption affinity for antibiotic contaminants than for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants. Aged PS particles had little adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, because the presence of oxygen-containing surface groups on the aged PS plastics might allow the formation of hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water molecules. Overall, a 2D-COS analysis was an effective method for understanding the ageing process of microplastics under different environmental conditions at high temperature. These results also clearly demonstrated the characteristics and mechanisms of the interaction between aged-microplastics and organic pollutants, which could be useful for understanding the environmental behavior of co-existing pollutants. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Research into microbe?€?microbe and microbe?€?substrate interactions requires knowledge of community phylogenetic composition but also tools to visualize spatial distributions of intact microbial biofilm communities. We developed a CLASI-FISH (combinatorial labelling and spectral imaging ?€? fluorescence in situ hybridization) method using confocal microscopy to study Plastisphere communities. We created a probe set consisting of three existing phylogenetic probes (targeting all Bacteria, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria) and four newly designed probes (targeting Bacteroidetes, Vibrionaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Alteromonadaceae) labelled with a total of seven fluorophores and validated this probe set using pure cultures. Our nested probe set strategy increases confidence in taxonomic identification because targets are confirmed with two or more probes, reducing false positives. We simultaneously identified and visualized these taxa and their spatial distribution within the microbial biofilms on polyethylene samples in colonization time series experiments in coastal environments from three different biogeographical regions. Comparing the relative abundance of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data with cell-count abundance data retrieved from the microscope images of the same samples showed a good agreement in bacterial composition. Microbial communities were heterogeneous, with direct spatial relationships between bacteria, cyanobacteria and eukaryotes such as diatoms but also micro-metazoa.

In contrast to marine plastic pollution, this ubiquitous problem is thus far scientifically poorly and policy approaches that tackle plastic pollution in soils comprehensively do not exist. In this article, we apply a qualitative governance analysis to assess the effectiveness of existing policy instruments to avoid harmful plastic pollution in (agricultural) soils against the background of international environmental agreements. In particular, environmental and fertiliser legislation relevant to soil protection in the European Union and in Germany are assessed. Regulatory weaknesses and gaps of the respective legislation are identified, and proposals for enhanced command-and-control provisions developed. However, the legal analysis furthermore shows that plastic pollution ecologically is also a problem of quantity, which is difficult to solve exclusively through command-and-control legislation. Instead, comprehensive quantity-control instruments to phase out fossil fuels (worldwide and in all sectors) as required by climate protection law can be effective approaches to tackle plastic pollution in environmental media like agricultural soils as well. ?? 2020 by the authors.

Efficient application of this closed loop of LA-PLA plastics-LA can minimize accumulation of plastics waste that pollute land and oceans. Temperature-dependent hydrolysis of PLA in water to LA follows apparent first order decay kinetics after a short lag. A modified Gompertz equation can explain the overall hydrolysis process. Alkali increased the rate of hydrolysis of PLA and reduced the length of lag period compared to water alone. The stoichiometry of base added to LA released was 1.0.

Mechanical joints using metallic bolts, screws, and pins are commonly used for joining thick glass fiber reinforced plastic laminates. Interference-fit pin connections provide beneficial effects such as fatigue enhancement and/or prevention of moisture intrusion to the fiber reinforced composites. This numerical and experimental study aims to investigate the effect of interference-fit on the bearing stiffness and strength of pin joined glass fiber reinforced plastic. The stress and strain distributions have been investigated for bearing loading through experiments as well as a nonlinear three dimensional finite element analysis. The quasi-static properties of the pin-loaded composites with interference-fit (0.6% and 1%) are compared with the samples with transition-fit (0% of interference-fit). The radial and the tangential strains on the vicinity of the hole obtained from the FE simulation were verified with the experimental results. The radial strains on the interference-fit pin joined glass fiber reinforced plastic coupons are lower than those on the transition-fit pin joined glass fiber reinforced plastic coupons at the consistent pin displacement, resulting in enhancement of the joint stiffness per unit bearing area by interference-fit. ??

This environmental change is generally thought to be too fast for adaptation using evolutionary process dependent on natural selection, and thus, resilience may be related to the presence of existing tolerant genotypes and species. Estuaries undergo natural partial pressure carbon dioxide (pCO2) fluctuations, with levels regularly exceeding predicted end of the century values. In this study, we use the estuarine orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) to explore the intrinsic resilience to elevated pCO2. Our sensitivity endpoints included: survival, heart rate, growth, and yolk consumption. Furthermore, we attempted to determine whether their acid-base regulatory machinery was plastic in response to elevated pCO2 by analysing the gene expression of key transporters and ionocyte density. Survival was not significantly altered by exposure to elevated pCO2. Interestingly, the heart rate was significantly elevated at both 1500 and 3100 ?atm exposure. However, other metrics of energetic consumption, such as yolk consumption and growth, were not significantly altered. Furthermore, we found no changes in gene expression in vha, nhe3, and nbc, as well as ionocyte density at elevated pCO2. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that estuarine species are resilient to the impacts of OA. ?? 2020 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2020. All rights reserved.

Trans Mountain project, Port of Vancouver, Canada","Although shipping has significant positive effect on human civilization, it introduced negative environmental impacts such as oil, air, and plastic pollutions. Many negative externalities through international and local regulations have been in place, and preventive actions have been taken to monitor and control. However, underwater noise pollution as an emerging negative shipping impact has not been well introduced to society nor appropriately regulated in international scale. Because of traffic density and the presence of sensitive marine species in some parts of the world, the negative social and environmental impacts of underwater noise pollution become more critical. Haro Strait due to high shipping traffic and presence of vulnerable marine species such as Southern Resident Killer Whale is a good example. The majority of ocean-going vessels transiting to Vancouver and vice versa pass through the corridor which includes Haro Strait. Tankers currently represent about 2% of total ship traffic visiting the Port of Vancouver; however, regarding the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project, the traffic density will grow by 11%, which will enhance the adverse impacts of underwater noise pollution on marine mammals. This study, by considering the features and characteristics of the area and the project, proposed four scenarios and modelling. The article by developing simulations and utilizing the Multiple Criteria Decision Making (Multiple Attribute Decision Making) algorithms and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution techniques strives to trade-off between the environmental (noise and CO2 emission) and economical (fuel cost) aspects of the project to enhance the Decision Support System to promote sustainable development. This will help the decision makers to have a multi-dimensional thinking instead of the single-dimensional thinking in addressing and tackling the negative externalities of the Trans Mountain project in the area.

In this study, molecularly imprinted silica material-coated quantum dots (MIS-QDs) with selective recognition capability to okadaic acid (OA) were developed and characterized. The synthesized MIS-QDs with specific imprinting cavities exhibited excellent recognition capability similar to those of biological antibodies and high fluorescence (FL) quenching selectivity for OA. Furthermore, the MIS-QDs with unsaturated bonds were immobilized onto the surface of 96-well microplates by cold plasma-induced grafting.

The environmental battery has a life of 40?€?60 days of sustainable electricity generation with the following order: horse manure > chicken manure > cow manure > sludge. In conclusion it is an advantageous option to produce electricity from animal manure as a cheap resource. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
SK8PKXMK,10.1098/rsos.191945,Reversible morphological changes in a juvenile marine fish after exposure to predatory alarm cues,"Chemical cues from predators induce a range of predator-induced morphological defences (PIMDs) observed across fish taxa. However, the mechanisms, consistency, direction and adaptive value of PIMDs are still poorly studied. Here, we have tested if predatory cues can induce changes in the body shape of the juvenile marine fish Sparus aurata reared under controlled conditions without the presence of predators by exposing individuals to the olfactory stimulus of a fish predator. We tested our hypothesis using a nested replicated before-after-control-impact experiment, including recovery (potential reversibility) after the cessation of the predator stimulus. Differences in the size-independent body shape were explored using landmark-based geometric morphometrics and revealed that, on average, individuals exposed to a predatory cue presented deeper bodies and longer caudal regions, according to our adaptive theoretical predictions. These average plastic responses were reversible after withdrawal of the stimulus and individuals returned to average body shapes. We, therefore, provide evidence supporting innate reversible PIMDs in marine naive fish reared under controlled conditions. The effects at the individual level, including fitness and the associated applied implications, deserve further research. ?? 2020 The Authors.

However, thorough assessments of their impact on threatened species are largely missing. In the Maldives, olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) are frequently caught in ghost nets however the archipelago does not support a significant nesting population. Our aim in this study was to determine the origin of olive ridleys entangled in ghost nets found in the Maldives and evaluate potential impacts on respective source populations. Based on a citizen science and conservation program, we recorded 132 olive ridley turtles entangled in ghost nets in just one year. Genetic analyses (mtDNA) of entangled individuals and of potential source populations revealed that most captured olive ridleys originated from Sri Lanka and eastern India. Oman could be excluded as source population, even during the prevalence of the south west monsoon. Based on our results and already available published literature, we were able to estimate that the recorded ghost net entanglements accounted for a relatively small amount (0.48%) of the eastern Indian population. However, the entangled turtles accounted for a much larger percentage (41%) of the Sri Lankan populations. However, it should be noted that our estimates of population-level mortality are linked to substantial uncertainty due to the lack of reliable information on population dynamics. Consequently, any precautionary protection measures applied should be complemented with improved quantification of turtle recruitment and life-stage specific mortalities. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Varied extents of MPs pollution have been observed at different WWTPs with limited information in Thailand. This research aimed to study the occurrence of MPs in municipal WWTPs in Thailand by measuring MPs of three WWTPs which employ different treatment process. The WWTPs were selected to represent MP pollution from urbanized and suburbanized areas with different treatment set-ups, i.e., sequence batch reactor (WWTP-A), oxidation ditch (WWTP-B), and conventional activated sludge (WWTP-C). Water and sludge sampling was performed at the inlet and outlet of primary and secondary treatment units. The results indicate that the average MPs removal efficiency of the WWTPs was ca. 84%, with the aeration tank as the main removal unit by transferring MPs from the water phase to sludge. Primary treatment comprising of screening and grit chambers could not remove MPs effectively. Most of the MPs observed in the WWTPs were fibers (32?€?57%), mostly made of polyester, polyethylene, polyacrylate, and polypropylene. From these results, it is suggested to implement tertiary treatment options to improve MPs removal efficiency in WWTPs, and to apply post-treatment to the WWTPs?€? raw sludge to prevent the MPs?€? release into the environment when the sludge is applied to agricultural land. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

Unlike radio frequency (RF) control, which has low tolerance toward electromagnetic interference (EMI), light control represents a promising method to overcome EMI. Nonetheless, long-distance light-controlled wireless actuation able to compete with RF control has not been achieved until now due to the lack of highly light-sensitive actuator designs. Here, it is demonstrate that amyloid-like protein aggregates can organize photomodule single-layer reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into a well-defined multilayer stack to display long-distance photoactuation. The amyloid-like proteinaceous component docks the rGO layers together to form a hybrid film, which can reliably adhere onto various material surfaces with robust interfacial adhesion. The sensitive photothermal effect and a fast bending in 1 s to switch a circuit are achieved after forming the film on a plastic substrate and irradiating the bilayer film with a blue laser from 100 m away. A photoactuation distance of 50 km can be further extrapolated based on a commercial high-power laser. This study reveals the great potential of amyloid-like aggregates in remote light control of robots and devices. ?? 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",

In this connection, the behaviors of 3-ply and 4-ply JP composite tubes of square and double-hat shaped sections subjected to axial quasi-static and impact loads are considered, and compared with 4-ply glass-polyester (GP) tubes of similar geometric configurations. Initially, basic mechanical characterization of JP laminates is carried out using a Universal Testing Machine, which is followed up with axial quasi-static and drop-weight impact testing of JP tubes, along with similar tests carried out on GP tubes. A thorough comparison is made between the performances including failure patterns of JP and GP components under axial loading using metrics such as peak load, mean crush load, absorbed energy, and specific energy absorption (SEA). As many structural applications involve dynamic bending loads, a comparative study is carried out between double-hat JP and GP components subjected to transverse impact loading. Based on the competitive values of mean load and SEA yielded by jute-composite tubes in the present study for axial impact loading, and high mean load and moderate energy absorption till failure recorded by similar components under three-point impact bending, it can be concluded that JP tubes can be capable of supporting impact loads under both axial and bending modes. ?? 2019 Society of Plastics Engineers",
CLIT2UER,10.1111/zsc.12413,The phylogeny of Nereididae (Annelida) based on mitochondrial genomes,"Nereididae comprises a diverse group of marine worms and is one of the most studied families in Annelida. However, phylogenetic relationships within the group are still poorly understood. Previous studies, based on morphological data, have disagreed on the membership of recognized subfamilies and, current taxonomy lacks sufficient phylogenetic underpinning. This study uses complete mitochondrial genome and transcriptome data to evaluate relationships within Nereididae and test currently employed subfamilies. Ancestral state reconstructions were performed to evaluate if morphological traits found in the pharynx, that is papillae and paragnaths, correspond with phylogenetic relationships based on mitochondrial data. Our results suggest that Nereidinae and Gymnonereidinae, as currently recognized, are not monophyletic groups. In general, molecular results suggest that morphological features used in nereidid taxonomy need re-evaluation as they may be more evolutionary plastic than recognized. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that papillae and paragnaths may have evolved early in the family and their presence, as currently employed in taxonomy, does not allow accurate diagnose of groups within Nereididae. In contrast, unique mitochondrial gene order defines at least one higher-level clade within Nereididae. ?? 2020 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences",

Limited studies have been conducted on the occurrence and distribution of NPPs. In this study, sediment samples were collected from 50 locations along the Korean coast to assess the occurrence, distribution, sources, and ecological risks of phthalates and NPPs. Phthalates and NPPs were detected in all sediments, indicating ubiquitous contamination of the coastal environment. Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and di(2-ethylhexyl)terephthalate (DEHT) were dominant, suggesting that DEHT could be an emerging contaminant of concern. The highest concentrations of phthalates and NPPs were found in sediment samples from harbors, implying they are contaminated hotspots. Sedimentary organic carbon was a major factor governing the distribution of phthalates and NPPs. Significant correlations were observed among phthalates and NPPs, suggesting similar sources and geochemical behavior. DEHP concentration exceeded threshold values, indicating potential health risks to benthic organisms in sediments. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Although some advances have been made, the use of self-healing electronics in wet and/or (under)water environments has proven to be quite challenging, and has not yet been fully realized. Herein, a new highly water insensitive self-healing elastomer with high stretchability and mechanical strength that can reach 1100% and ???6.5 MPa, respectively, is reported. The elastomer exhibits a high (>80%) self-healing efficiency (after ??? 24 h) in high humidity and/or different (under)water conditions without the assistance of an external physical and/or chemical triggers. Soft electronic devices made from this elastomer are shown to be highly robust and able to recover their electrical properties after damages in both ambient and aqueous conditions. Moreover, once operated in extreme wet or underwater conditions (e.g., salty sea water), the self-healing capability leads to the elimination of significant electrical leakage that would be caused by structural damages. This highly efficient self-healing elastomer can help extend the use of soft electronics outside of the laboratory and allow a wide variety of wet and submarine applications. ?? 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

NVPCVKHA,10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104686,Making the circular economy work for human development,"This paper aims to re-conceptualise and advance the existing frameworks and practical applications of the circular economy (CE) towards a broader approach to development in general and, more particularly, to combine it with the approach for Human Development (HD). The CE is an alternative to the current ""take, make, waste?€? extractive industrial model and offers a practical solution to address global and local environmental challenges, such as resource depletion, marine plastic pollution, and for staying within planetary system boundaries. Although the CE and related concepts such as cradle to cradle provide a most promising alternative to the traditional linear economy model and its impacts on the planets eco-systems, some of the CE key elements have raised debate both in the academic community and among policy makers. One of the debates concerns the missing social or human dimensions of the CE. Likewise, the HD approach lacks considerations of environmental sustainability. Drawing on both academic and grey literature and the authors?? research observations and professional experiences in the fields of promoting the CE and international development cooperation for HD, we attempt to develop an integrative conceptual framework of the CE and HD. This framework includes social-economic elements of the transformation from linear to circular economic models, combined with HD from the social sciences and development studies. We thereby complement the technological-material focused CE model that is primarily based on principles of industrial ecology and engineering. We utilize the existing ?€?circular humansphere?? concept to articulate the incorporation of HD into the discussion of CE. By bringing in explicit links with HD, we pursue a double aim: First, to raise awareness and understanding among the CE research community of the missing human dimension in current CE discourse, and second, to familiarise the international development community with the approaches of CE. This will advance the options for adopting CE practices in international development programmes and for the process of implementing the social SDGs concerning HD such as SDG 1, 3, 4, 5, and 10. Finally, we hope that this CE and HD framework can contribute to the resolution of environmental and developmental issues. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Velocities and densities in our computational mesh are defined by integrating the regional Cascadia Community Velocity Model (CVM) v1.6 (Stephenson et al. P-and S-wave velocity models incorporating the Cascadia subduction zone for 3D earthquake ground motion simulations?€?update for open-file report 2007?€?1348, US Geological Survey, 2017) including the ocean water layer with a local velocity model of the Georgia basin (Molnar, Predicting earthquake ground shaking due to 1D soil layering and 3D basin structure in SW British Columbia, Canada, 2011), including additional near-surface velocity information. We generate six source realizations, each consisting of a background slip distribution with correlation lengths, rise times and rupture velocities consistent with data from previous megathrust earthquakes (e.g., 2011 M 9 Tohoku or 2010 M 8.8 Maule). We then superimpose M 8 subevents, characterized by short rise times and high stress drops on the background slip model to mimic high-frequency strong ground motion generation areas in the deeper portion of the rupture (Frankel, Bull Seismol Soc Am 107(1):372?€?386, 2017). The wave propagation is simulated using the discontinuous mesh (DM) version of the AWP finite difference code. We simulate frequencies up to 1.25 Hz, using a spatial discretization of 100 m in the fine grid, resulting in surface grid dimensions of 6540 ?? 10,728 mesh points. At depths below 8 km, the grid step increases to 300 m. We obtain stable and accurate results for the DM method throughout the simulation time of 7.5 min as verified against a solution obtained with a uniform 100 m grid spacing. Peak ground velocities (PGVs) range between 0.57 and 1.0 m/s in downtown Seattle and between 0.25 and 0.54 m/s in downtown Vancouver, while spectral accelerations at 2 s range between 1.7 and 3.6 m/s2 and 1.0 and 1.3 m/s2, respectively. These long-period ground motions are not significantly reduced if plastic Drucker-Prager yielding in shallow cohesionless sediments is taken into account. Effects of rupture directivity are significant at periods of 10 s, but almost absent at shorter periods. We find that increasing the depth extent of the subducting slab from the truncation at 60 km in the Cascadia CVM version 1.6 to 100 km increases the PGVs by 15% in Seattle and by 40% in Vancouver. ?? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",
BAMM57IP,10.1103/PhysRevFluids.5.054307,Dynamics of floating objects at high particulate Reynolds numbers,"The motion of high Reynolds number objects at free surfaces is a general problem that has many industrial and ecological applications, such as hazard assessment due to driftwood in rivers or motion of plastic patches in the oceans. Modeling such object trajectories in a flow can be done assuming the object to be a tracer or using Newton's second law in the form of the Basset-Boussinesq-Oseen equation. In many studies, however, the latter approach can be difficult to implement due to the presence of complex forces at play and a high computational cost, thus knowing the validity of the tracer model can be very useful for practical applications. In this work, we study theoretically and experimentally the dynamics of high Reynolds number floating objects in one- and two-dimensional free surface flows. We first verify that the two-dimensional surface version of the Basset-Boussinesq-Oseen equation can accurately model floating object trajectories. Following our theoretical analysis, we introduce a characteristic response distance noted ?? that scales the acceleration distance of a floating object, and we show that it is about two to four times the body length in the streamwise direction. The dimensionless parameter ?? obtained by normalizing ?? by a flow length scale then plays a role analogous to that of the Stokes number at low particulate Reynolds number. Moreover, we show that once the floating object reaches the flow velocity, or if at any given time its velocity is equal to that of the flow, the floating object behaves like a tracer, regardless of ??. These results can greatly simplify the analyses and computations of the motion of floating objects at high particulate Reynolds number, first by identifying a characteristic distance ?? scaling the length of the acceleration phase, and then by showing that once the flow velocity is reached, the object is transported as a passive tracer. ?? 2020 American Physical Society.",

The physical and chemical properties of the pit sand, sea sand, plastic wastes, and pavement block were determined. The FTIR identified Quartz and Kaoline minerals as the main components of the sand samples, whereas those of the plastic wastes were polyethylene and polypropylene. The SEM showed that the plastic-pit sand pavement block (PPPB) had fibrous surface with smaller pore volume and grain size than the plastic-sea sand pavement block (PSPB). At 20% plastic composition, the water absorptivity of PPPB and PSPB maximized at 3.98% and 4.60%, respectively. Larger quantity of plastic decreased the block water absorptivity but improved the compressive strength. The maximum compressive strengths of the PPPB and PSPB were 36.96 N/mm2 and 27.81 N/mm2, respectively. The maximum tensile strength of PPPB (8.2 N/mm2) exceeded the PSPB (6.1 N/mm2). Furthermore, increasing the plastic composition improved the average penetration resistance of both pavement blocks. The results suggest that converting plastic wastes into pavement blocks is feasible, and can help reduce the rapid accumulation of plastic wastes in Ghana. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Soils in Uppsala, Sweden, contain low concentrations of arsenic (As). We hypothesize that if certain japonica paddy rice varieties can adapt to the cold climate and long day length in Uppsala and produce normal grains, such a variety could be used for organic production of low-arsenic rice for safe rice consumption. A japonica paddy rice variety, ?€?Heijing 5,?€? can be cultivated in Uppsala, Sweden, after several years?€? adaptation, provided that the rice plants are kept under a simple plastic cover when the temperature is below 10??C. Uppsala-adapted ?€?Heijing 5?€? has a low concentration of 0.1 mg per kg and high protein content of 12.6% per dry weight in brown rice grain, meaning that it thus complies with all dietary requirements determined by the EU and other countries for small children. The high protein content is particularly good for small children in terms of nutrition. Theoretically, Uppsala-adapted ?€?Heijing 5?€? can produce a yield of around 5100 kg per ha, and it has a potential for organic production. In addition, we speculate that cultivation of paddy rice can remove nitrogen and phosphorus from Swedish river water and reduce nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea and associated algae blooms. ??

Some genera can grow in brackish waters, but these biota are more commonly referred to as freshwater plants. Utilization of this macrophyte as fish and livestock feed (cattle, goats, ducks, ducks and chickens) have been introduced in some part of the world. Therefore, it is necessary to know the best way to adapt the fern into brackish water ecosystem and examine the potential for growth in such environment. In this study, two adaptation methods were performed, namely instant adaptation (IA) method and the step by step adaptation (SSA) method. A number of 25-liter plastic basin were filled with 20 l of freshwater or sea water, salt marsh sediment (500 g) and fermented chicken manure (500 g) and used as experimental unit. In the IA approach, the water salinity was adjusted from the beginning at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 ppt, planted with fern and observed for 21 days. While in the SSA method, the fern was firstly grown on an experimental unit of 0 ppt for 7 days. Then the water salinity was increased of 1 ppt every 7 days, until day 49. All experimental units were observed daily, including; survival rate, absolute growth, total growth, doubling time, and histological observations of leaves, rhizomes and macrophyte roots. The study showed that in IA aproach, A. microphyla grew normally only in salinity 0 ppt (freshwater). In 5 ppt experimental unit, the organisms survived until day 14. Similarly, at 10 ppt, the macrophytes grew and branched up to day 7. While the treatment of salinity 15 and 20 ppt A. microphylla survived up to 5 and 3 days only, respectively. In SSA method, the fern grew well and the population increased until day 49 at salinity 6 ppt. From the study can be suggested that in case of growing A. mycrphylla in brackish water ecosystem, the organism can be cultivated at salinity below 6 ppt by using step by step method of adaptation. ??

Together with the deposition of inorganic sediments during high tides, organic soil production by halophytic vegetation, and organic matter decomposition, land subsidence due to natural soil compression is a major factor controlling the actual elevation of salt-marsh platforms. Due to their high porosity and compressibility, the marsh sedimentary body undergoes large compression because of the load of overlying more recent deposits. The characterization of the geotechnical properties of these deposits is therefore of paramount importance to quantify consolidation versus accretion and relative sea level rise. However, undisturbed sampling of this loose material is extremely challenging and lab tests on in-situ collected samples are not properly representative of in-situ conditions due to the scale effects in highly heterogeneous silty soils such as those of the Venice lagoon. To overcome this limitation, an in-situ loading test was carried out in the Lazzaretto Nuovo salt-marsh in the Venice Lagoon, Italy. The load is obtained by a number of plastic tanks that are filled with seawater, reaching a cumulative load of 40 kN applied on a 2:5??1:8m2 surface. Specific instrumentations were deployed before positioning the tanks to measure soil vertical displacement at various depths below the load (0, 10, and 50 cm) and distances (0, 40, and 80 cm) from the load centre. Moreover, six pressure transducers were used to record overpressure dissipation over time. The collected datasets will be interpreted through a 3-D flow-deformation model that, once calibrated, provides reliable estimates of the compressibility values for each monitored depth interval. ??Author(s) 2020.",

Our study highlights the presence of three deformation components related to different processes controlling land subsidence: elastic, delayed-elastic, and irreversible (plastic) components. The elastic and delayed-elastic components are closely related to water table fluctuations that change the effective stress in two portions of the coastal aquifer at a daily (in the sandy unconfined portion) and seasonal time scales (in the layered clay-rich semi-confined prodelta portion), respectively. The irreversible component represents the trend in the land subsidence time series and is due to primary consolidation (pore pressure dissipation) of the fine-grained prodelta levels above where the settlement gauge is located. The amplitudes of the elastic component can be up to 0.2-0.3mm whereas the amplitude of the delayed-elastic component reaches 0.89 mm. The primary consolidation rate of deformation is 0.9mmyr1 and constrains the likely age of prodelta sediments deposition to 1300-2800 years before present. The delayed-elastic subsidence rate has similar magnitude to that due to primary consolidation and is connected to poroelastic effects in the prodelta sequence following seasonal variations in water table. Our findings are important for planning land subsidence management and monitoring strategies especially where the surface aquifer structure is heterogeneous due to different depositional settings. The natural land subsidence rate in the Holocene sediments of the shallow coastal aquifer of Ravenna (North eastern Italy) that we measured in this study accounts for 10 %-20% of the total current land subsidence rate observed in this portion of Ravenna coastal area (10-20mmyr1). ??Author(s) 2020.",
IYTJYXG7,10.1021/acs.est.9b05995,"Effects of Virgin Micro- and Nanoplastics on Fish: Trends, Meta-Analysis, and Perspectives","Environmental plastic pollution is a major ecological and societal concern today. Over the past decade, a broad range of laboratory and experimental studies have complemented field observations in the hope of achieving a better understanding of the fate and impact of micro- and/or nanoplastics (MP/NP) on diverse organisms (e.g., birds, fish, and mammals). However, plastic pollution remains challenging to monitor in the environment and to control under laboratory conditions, and plastic particles are often naturally or experimentally co-contaminated with diverse chemical pollutants. Therefore, our understanding of the effects of virgin MP/NP in freshwater and marine fish is still limited. Here, we performed a systematic review of the most up-to-date literature on the effects of virgin MP/NP on fish under laboratory conditions. A total of 782 biological endpoints investigated in 46 studies were extracted. Among these endpoints, 32% were significantly affected by exposure to virgin MP/NP. More effects were observed for smaller plastic particles (i.e., size ???20 ??m), affecting fish behavioral and neurological functions, intestinal permeability, metabolism, and intestinal microbiome diversity. In addition, we propose suggestions for new research directions to lead toward innovative, robust, and scientifically sound experiments in this field. This review of experimental studies reveals that the toxicity of virgin MP/NP on fish should be more systematically evaluated using rigorous laboratory-based methods and aims toward a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this toxicity to fish.",

As a model contaminant, the hydrophobic pesticide deltamethrin (DM) was chosen, and its effects on life history traits of Daphnia magna were studied in the presence or absence of polyethylene MPs. Commercialized DM and MPs obtained as dry powder were used in the experiment. According the manufacturer (Cospheric, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) MPs were spherical (1?€?4 ??m in diameter), had a density of 0.96 g/cm???3 and were without any solvent. Three concentrations of polyethylene MPs were tested (0, 1, 10 mg/L) with two realistic concentrations of DM (0 and 40 ng/L) and a solvent control (acetone). During the 21 d experiment, D. magna neonates were individually exposed to the treatments, and the effects of MPs and DM alone and together were evaluated by assessing survival, number of cumulative molts, days to first brood, number of broods, number of neonates per surviving adult, and body length. Significant detrimental effects on survival were only observed for the two mixture treatments. DM alone (40 ng/L) delayed the days to first brood and reduced the number of neonates per surviving adult, whereas MPs alone (10 mg/L) induced significant reduction in the number of juveniles by surviving adults. The combined exposure to DM and MPs clearly had a synergistic effect on survival, brood number, and number of neonates per surviving female. For example, compared to exposure to 40 ng/L of DM alone, the addition of 1 mg/L of MPs resulted in a 51.1% reduction in number of neonates per surviving female and a 46% reduction in brood number. These results suggest the potential drastic effects of this kind of mixed exposure on daphnid populations, which are key components of freshwater food webs. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

In this way, genetic algorithm has been used for application of the combination of elementary mechanisms in the classic plastic analysis problem. Findings: The studied structures are optimized by plastic analysis theory before and after the fire and their failure modes are compared with each other. The comparison of the results indicates significant changes in the load factor value, as well as the critical collapse mode of the structure before and after the fire. Originality/value: Results indicate that the combination of plastic analysis and a genetic algorithm can predict the collapse mode of the structure before and after the fire accurately. ?? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",
5FENVPZ6,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119844,For a new plastics economy in agriculture: Policy reflections on the EU strategy from a local perspective,"Plastic production and consumption around the world have seen a rapid increase since the end of World War II, with an expected peak in the next 20 years. Agriculture is among the causes of this due to its intensive farming practices and the use of various plastic materials. This produces both advantages (e.g. yield increase, early harvest, reduced use of chemicals) and disadvantages. The disadvantages are particularly related to a plastic waste management problem, from which the contamination of terrestrial, marine and air environments with severe consequences on food security and human health also derive. With the 2018 European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, the European Commission (EC) identifies a set of actions to reduce plastic pollution in the decades ahead. For the actual implementation of this strategic vision, however, innovative investment and appropriate policy tools need to be identified. This paper attempts to understand the acceptability of some ad-hoc policy tools among farmers by investigating their attitudes towards the application of subsidies, tax-credits and pay-back (this latter under an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme) to abate agricultural plastic pollution with the aim of making this sector cleaner and more oriented to the implementation of the sustainability principles. While referring to the territory of the province of Foggia in southern Italy as a case study, we analyse the preferences expressed by 1,783 farmers by using a multinomial logistic regression. Key results suggest that large agricultural farms would favour the adoption of tax-credits. In contrast, small farms would consider more favourable the introduction of a pay-back tool to incentivize their contribution to plastic pollution abatement. The significance of the obtained results is twofold. First, farm size is a key element towards a differentiation of policy tools to adopt for plastic waste management in agriculture. Second, the differentiation of the above policy tools according to the farm dimension would lead to a cost-effectiveness management of agricultural plastic waste. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In this paper, local structural analysis for the pressure vessel considering the bolted part was carried out as well as global buckling analysis. That is, aluminium alloy and stainless steel pressure vessel models were designed for operating under high pressure equivalent to the water depth up to 2000 and 1000 m, respectively. Pressure vessel design procedure was performed by using empirical formulae and eigenvalue analysis by an FEM code. The results were verified and investigated by pressure tests in the hyperbaric chamber of KRISO. It was found that all the estimated results by the empirical formula and FEA are overestimated when the results are compared to the pressure test results in the pressure chamber. ?? 2019, ?? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
V2K9JDVM,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136700,A comprehensive study on the leaching of metals from heated tobacco sticks and cigarettes in water and natural waters,"The leaching behavior of Al, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Ba, Hg and Pb in water from two types of heat-not-burn tobacco sticks is presented here, and compared to that from conventional cigarettes. The total concentration of each metal in solid tobacco products was initially determined. Concentrations in used and unused tobacco sticks were similar and generally, lower than those in unused conventional cigarettes. Studies on the contribution of paper, filter and tobacco revealed that tobacco was the major source of metal contamination. Smoking conventional cigarettes reduced the total metal concentrations since a substantial amount of metals was retained in the ash; a post-consumption waste that is difficult to collect. Batch leaching tests were performed to determine dissolved concentrations as a function of time. With the exceptions of As and (in most cases) Hg that were not detected, metals were released at varying rates. At 24 h of soaking the percentage of metals leached ranged from 0.2?€?43%. The contribution of paper, filter and tobacco to the dissolved concentrations at 24 h of leaching was investigated and in almost all cases tobacco was the major source of metal contamination. The dissolved concentrations from ash were low as metals were strongly bound. Varying the pH, ionic strength and humic acids content at environmentally relevant values did not affect leaching of metals at 24 h of soaking. The use of river water, rain water and seawater as leachants was also not found to alter dissolved concentrations at 24 h compared to ultrapure water. The results presented here suggest that the consequences of improper disposal of tobacco products in the environment are two-sided and that next to the generation of plastic litter, discarded tobacco products can also act as point sources of metal contamination. Public education campaigns focusing on the environmental impact and best disposal practices are urgently needed. ?? 2020 The Authors",

The sediments were incubated at 28??C and tested after 6 months, when clear signs of degradation were visible in the exposed samples, and after 12 months, when the samples had completely disappeared. The model organisms selected for the study were the unicellular algae Dunaliella tertiolecta, the sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) juveniles. The unicellular algae and sea urchins were used to determine the toxicological endpoint of growth inhibition and embryotoxicity, respectively, and the sea bass juveniles were tested to evaluate sublethal effect endpoints using lipid peroxidation and genotoxicity biomarkers. Elutriates of sediment inoculated with Mater-Bi for 6 and 12 months showed an absence of toxic effects in all of the model organisms exposed in this study. The Mater-Bi degradation process did not generate or transfer into the elutriates toxic substances that could cause alterations in the growth of D. tertiolecta, in the P. lividus embryo-toxicity assay or in the sensitive biomarker responses of the fish D. labrax. The tested species are considered to be representatives of different levels of the marine trophic chain. The results obtained in this study suggest that the ecotoxicological approach applied may be suitable for investigating the environmental impact of the degradation of bioplastics in marine sediments. ??

Countless microplastics, originating from fragmentation, weathering of larger objects or primary sources, pose a widespread ecological risk. In this study, the dispersion of suspended and floating microplastic particles in the East China Seas (ECSs) and adjacent seas was investigated via a coupled numerical model that included a Lagrangian particle tracking module. The role of tidal dynamics was considered in transporting the microplastic particles in the ECSs and adjacent seas. The results highlighted significant differences between the transport of suspended and floating microplastic particles. Although microplastic particles originating from different source areas followed different pathways, the Taiwan Strait, the Tokara Strait and the Tsushima Strait were identified as the major delivery channels. Of these, the Taiwan Strait played the most important role in the export of near-surface floating microplastic particles from the ECSs. The results showed that only a small fraction of the microplastic particles produced from the coastal waters of China ( 18%) and Korea ( 14%) entered the Pacific Ocean. However, nearly all of the microplastic particles originating from the west and south coasts of Kyushu Island entered the Pacific Ocean. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

However, few field studies have examined the characteristics and major influencing factors of MPs in marine zooplankton. The present study investigated the shape, color, size, chemical composition and quantity of MPs in zooplankton in the rainy and dry seasons in the Bohai Sea. Furthermore, the relationship between the MPs in zooplankton and the MPs in seawater was studied. The results showed that the MPs in zooplankton of the Bohai Sea were dominated by blue fibers. In the rainy and dry seasons, fibers accounted for 92% and 93%, respectively, of all ingested MPs, while 50% and 55%, respectively, of ingested MPs were blue. The average size of MPs in zooplankton was 1300 ?? 1520 ??m in the rainy season and 1040 ?? 1060 ??m in the dry season. Regarding the MP chemical composition, in the rainy and dry seasons, the ingested MPs were dominated by cellophane, which accounted for 53% and 68%, respectively, of MPs, followed by polyester (PET), which accounted for 18% and 20%, respectively, of MPs. The composition of MPs in zooplankton was mainly affected by the composition of MPs in seawater. No significant difference in the MP composition was observed between the two seasons or among the different zooplankton groups. The MP number was significantly higher in individual medusa than in individuals of other zooplankton groups. The mean quantity of MPs in the Bohai Sea zooplankton community in the rainy season was 2.03 ?? 2.87 piece/m3, which was significantly higher than that in the dry season, 0.41 ?? 0.38 piece/m3. The above results will provide a reference for marine ecological risk assessments based on the characteristics of MPs in natural seas. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

The study areas are well known for the high population and high industrial activities that can contribute to the plastic pollution. In this case, microplastics were sampled from the surface sediments at four different stations representing different local activities. The microplastics were extracted by the density separation method from collected samples. Each particle was identified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Furthermore, beach litters were obtained according to the adopted methodology - guidance on monitoring of marine litter in European seas. The obtained mean concentrations are 182.66 ?? 27.32 and 649.33 ?? 184.02 kg???1 sediment (DW), respectively. A detailed spatial and quantitative analysis revealed that their distribution was a function of proximity to populated areas and associated with wastewater effluents, industrial installations, degree of shore exposure and complex tidal flow patterns. Five types of microplastics were identified; the most common were fibers (70%), fragments (21%), pellets (5%), films (2%) and foams (2%). Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis showed that the main polymers detected in the studied microplastics were polyethylene (48%), polypropylene (16%), polyethylene terephthalate (14%), polystyrene (9%), butyl branham (7%), ethylene propylene (3%) and cellulose tri acetate (3%). The obtained results provided a holistic view of the abundance, distribution, and characteristics of microplastics in the Gulf of Annaba. This study confirmed the presence of microplastics in the Gulf of Annaba, albeit further studies remain necessary for better understanding of sources and fate. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

In this study, the edible seaweed nori (Pyropia spp.) was chosen as a target species. The microplastic contaminant situations in nori were analyzed in both its final commercial products and the intermediate products across different processing stages. The abundance of microplastics ranged from 0.9 to 3.0 items/g (dw) among 24 brands of commercially packaged nori samples. With the development of nori processing stages, an enlarged size fraction of greater microplastics (1?€?5 mm) was observed. Compared with commercially packaged nori samples, the proportions of polypropylene, polyethylene and poly (ethylene-propylene) copolymers increased, whereas that of polyester decreased in factory-processed nori. Additionally, we further simulated and quantified the number of fluorescent polyester fibers (concentrations: 0, 1000, 5000, 10,000 fibers/L) attach to the algal pieces of Pyropia yezoensis under laboratory conditions. The average abundance of microfibers on the nori was positively and quantitatively related to their abundances in seawater (p < 0.01). To our best knowledge, this is the first work that shows the prevalence of microplastics in the commercial seaweed nori and relates to their potential sources during the processing phase. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Since 2005, the International Pellet Watch used plastic pellets to monitor hydrophobic organic contaminants in marine environments. We examined the spatial distribution and sources of 16 PAHs and eight OCPs on microplastics (pellets, fragments, and foam) collected from eastern Guangdong beaches with the goal of evaluating the feasibility of exclusively using pellets in global monitoring of hydrophobic organic contaminants. The ???PAH and ???OCP concentrations ranged from 11.2 to 7710 ng g???1 and 2.2?€?1970 ng g???1, respectively. Although inter-site and regional differences were insignificant in fragments and foam, regional differences were observed in ???OCP concentrations on pellets samples collected at the estuary mouth and the distributary (p &lt; 0.05). No regional difference in ???PAH concentration on microplastics was observed, except between fragments from the remote beach and those from the distributary (p = 0.015) and the estuary mouth (p = 0.015). The compositional profiles of PAHs revealed that PAHs with 2?€?4 rings were more dominant than those with &gt;4 rings. Considering low molecular weight PAHs are less hydrophobic and more toxic; the results suggest low molecular weight PAHs may pose a significant risk to marine organisms. This study shows that the International Pellet Watch could offer critical data on source and transport of microplastic-associated OCPs but may overlook critical vehicles of PAHs in coastal environments such as foam. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",

To develop suitable management options and reduce microplastic emissions in treated effluent and sludge, we must first develop a reliable method to understand their transport and fate throughout the treatment process. An improved methodology was applied to determine the size, shape, polymer type and partitioning behaviour of MPs using a combination of oxidation treatment, fluorescent staining and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to detect small MPs ???20 ??m in wastewater. The mean number of MPs (<5 mm) detected using this methodology was 11.80 ?? 1.10 MP/L in raw sewage, 5.23 ?? 0.25 MP/L in degritted wastewater, 7.91 ?? 0.44 MP/L in waste activated sludge and 2.76 ?? 0.11 MP/L in the final treated effluent. An increase in MPs following primary screening suggests that WAS is a sink for several stealth microplastics, including glitter, which is returned to the effluent during the treatment process. The estimated MP removal efficiency for the studied WWTP is relatively poor compared with global data for secondary WWTPs, which is likely due to the release of partially treated effluent into the Pacific Ocean via a second discharge point. The information generated through this study can be useful to; firstly, inform on-site wastewater management practices, and secondly, reduce MP concentrations in final treated effluents discharged to the marine environment. ?? 2020",

Firstly, they may be adsorbed to the plastic surface or hydrogenous-biogenic accumulations thereon, and secondly, they may be present in the polymeric matrix as functional additives or as reaction or recyclate residues. In this study, the relative significance of these associations is evaluated with respect to Pb in beached marine microplastics. Thus, adsorbed Pb was determined in &lt;5 mm, neutrally-coloured polyethylene pellets that contained no detectable Pb added during manufacture by digestion in dilute aqua regia, while the bioaccessibility of this association was evaluated using an avian physiologically-based extraction test (PBET). Here, up to about 0.1 ??g g???1 of Pb was adsorbed to the plastic and between about 60 and 70% of the metal was accessible. Lead present as additive or residue was determined by x-ray fluorescence analysis of a wider range of beached plastics (polyolefins and polyvinyl chloride), with a selection of positive samples grated to mm-dimensions and subjected to the PBET. Here, total Pb concentrations up to 40,000 ??g g???1 and bioaccessibilities up to 16% were observed, with bioaccessible concentrations exceeding equivalent values for adsorbed Pb by several orders of magnitude. Ingestive exposure to Pb, and potentially other toxic metals, is more important through the presence of additives in historical plastics and recyclate residues in contemporary plastics than from adsorption, and it is recommended that future studies focus more on the environmental impacts and fate of metals bound in this form. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The mussel Mytilus spp. has extremely powerful immune defenses toward different potential pathogens and contaminant stressors. In particular, the mussel immune system represents a significant target for different types of nanoparticles (NPs), including amino-modified nanopolystyrene (PS-NH2) as a model of nanoplastics. In this work, the effects of repeated exposure to PS-NH2 on immune responses of Mytilus galloprovincialis were investigated after a first exposure (10 ??g/L; 24 h), followed by a resting period (72-h depuration) and a second exposure (10 ??g/L; 24 h). Functional parameters were measured in hemocytes, serum, and whole hemolymph samples. In hemocytes, transcription of selected genes involved in proliferation/apoptosis and immune response was evaluated by qPCR. First exposure to PS-NH2 significantly affected hemocyte mitochondrial and lysosomal parameters, serum lysozyme activity, and transcription of proliferation/apoptosis markers; significant upregulation of extrapallial protein precursor (EPp) and downregulation of lysozyme and mytilin B were observed. The results of functional hemocyte parameters indicate the occurrence of stress conditions that did not however result in changes in the overall bactericidal activity. After the second exposure, a shift in hemocyte subpopulations, together with reestablishment of basal functional parameters and of proliferation/apoptotic markers, was observed. Moreover, hemolymph bactericidal activity, as well as transcription of five out of six immune-related genes, all codifying for secreted proteins, was significantly increased. The results indicate an overall shift in immune parameters that may act as compensatory mechanisms to maintain immune homeostasis after a second encounter with PS-NH2. ??

Studies conducted so far have only reported effects on scleractinian species. Knowledge about its effects on other corals (e.g. Order Zoantharia) remains uncovered, and responses at biochemical levels remain poorly documented. This study aimed to assess the potential effects induced by the presence of microplastics (1 and 10 mg L???1 low-density polyethylene, LDPE MP, or polyvinyl chloride, PVC MP) in the tropical and subtropical cosmopolitan species Zoanthus sociatus (order Zoantharia. Anthozoa: Hexacorallia), at organism level (survival and behaviour), endosymbionts (photosynthetic efficiency) and the cellular level (oxidative stress, detoxification capacity and energy metabolism). In a short-term exposure (96 h), this species was more sensitive to PVC MP. The presence of this polymer at a concentration of 10 mg L???1 caused a ten-fold higher adhesion to the coral epidermis, increased photosynthetic efficiency, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant defences; without, however, inducing energetic costs. Although the observed physiological and biochemical effects did not compromise Z. sociatus survival in the short term, it does not rule out potential long-term (cumulative) effects that could endanger this and other physiologically similar species that underlie coral reefs. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

However, current toxic fabrication methods also lead to environment risks. Nanoparticle agglomeration, poor compatibility with polymer, and rapid release of Ag+ result in short-term efficacy. In this study, a facile one-pot synthesis method of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) encapsulated in polymeric urushiol (PUL) was developed. AgNPs were synthesized in situ by natural urushiol, serving as a reductant, dispersant and surfactant. Simultaneously, silver nitrate catalyzed the polymerization of urushiol into PUL. This in situ reduction method made AgNPs uniformly distributed in the polymer matrix. The binding between the AgNPs and the PUL resulted in the stable release of Ag+. Results showed the antibacterial rate of a 0.1% AgNPs coating is 100% in laboratory experiments.

In this paper, cyclic pseudo-static tests were conducted on three 1/4-scaled RC column specimens with and without retrofit by carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) fabric in order to investigate seismic performance of low-level corroded columns and the efficiency of CFRP as a retrofit measure. The first specimen was designed with normal design details of Chinese specifications, which worked as a reference. The second and third columns were both corroded with a target of low-level corrosion in the plastic hinge zone using an electrochemical method. Meanwhile, the third column was retrofitted by CFRP jackets in the plastic hinge region. The experimental results were then employed to evaluate the damage process, failure mode, displacement ductility, energy dissipation, lateral resistance strength, and residual displacement of each specimen. The results show that although low level of corrosion in the tested columns, the displacement ductility was significantly reduced due to weakened confinement of the corroded transverse rebars and reduced area of the corroded longitudinal bars. In addition, retrofitting the column using CFRP fabric jackets could significantly increase the displacement ductility and reduce the residual displacement to some extent. It is worth noting that retrofitting of corroded column using CFRP jackets did not improve the lateral strength. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

RS56U559,10.1039/c9ay02621e,A non-lethal SPME-LC/MS method for the analysis of plastic-associated contaminants in coral reef invertebrates,"Current approaches to evaluate microplastic contamination of the marine environment include the use of marine organisms as bioindicators and the detection of plastic-associated contaminants in their tissues. Liquid/liquid extraction and/or solid-phase extraction are the usual methods of choice for sample preparation. However, these methods suffer from background contamination, due to the large volume of solvents used and the ubiquity of plasticizers in laboratory environments. Moreover, organisms used in the study may belong to species that are rare or endangered and these should preferably not be sacrificed as a consequence of the relatively sizeable biological material required for exhaustive sample extractions and the destructive nature of mass spectrometry analysis. In this study, we evaluated, as a non-lethal alternative, a procedure involving solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis. Two coral reef invertebrates that may be sensitive to microplastic contamination were used for the tests, i.e., the scleractinian Danafungia scruposa and the bivalve mollusk Tridacna maxima. The results showed that the method was effective in quantifying phthalate esters within ten minutes of exposure, offering at the same time an improved control of the background contamination compared to the classical extraction procedure. ??

HE5Q3KLL,10.5194/bg-17-1975-2020,Determining how biotic and abiotic variables affect the shell condition and parameters of <i>Heliconoides inflatus</i> pteropods from a sediment trap in the Cariaco Basin,"Pteropods have been nicknamed the ""canary in the coal mine"" for ocean acidification because they are predicted to be among the first organisms to be affected by changing ocean chemistry. This is due to their fragile, aragonitic shells and high abundances in polar and subpolar regions where the impacts of ocean acidification are most pronounced. For pteropods to be used most effectively as indicators of ocean acidification, the biotic and abiotic factors influencing their shell formation and dissolution in the modern ocean need to be quantified and understood. Here, we measured the shell condition (i.e., the degree to which a shell has dissolved) and shell characteristics, including size, number of whorls, shell thickness, and shell volume (i.e., amount of shell material) of nearly 50 specimens of the pteropod species <i>Heliconoides inflatus</i> sampled from a sediment trap in the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela, over an 11-month period. The shell condition of pteropods from sediment traps has the potential to be altered at three stages: (1) when the organisms are live in the water column associated with ocean acidification, (2) when organisms are dead in the water column associated with biotic decay of organic matter and/or abiotic dissolution associated with ocean acidification, and (3) when organisms are in the closed sediment trap cup associated with abiotic alteration by the preservation solution. Shell condition was assessed using two methods: the <i>Limacina</i> Dissolution Index (LDX) and the opacity method. The opacity method was found to capture changes in shell condition only in the early stages of dissolution, whereas the LDX recorded dissolution changes over a much larger range. Because the water in the Cariaco Basin is supersaturated with respect to aragonite year-round, we assume no dissolution occurred during life, and there is no evidence that shell condition deteriorated with the length of time in the sediment trap. Light microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show the majority of alteration happened to dead pteropods while in the water column associated with the decay of organic matter. The most altered shells occurred in samples collected in September and October when water temperatures were warmest and when the amount of organic matter degradation, both within the shells of dead specimens and in the water column, was likely to have been the greatest.</p> The hydrographic and chemical properties of the Cariaco Basin vary seasonally due to the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Shells of <i>H. inflatus</i> varied in size, number of whorls, and thickness throughout the year. There was not a strong correlation between the number of whorls and the shell diameter, suggesting that shell growth is plastic. <i>H. inflatus</i> formed shells that were 40&thinsp;% thicker and 20&thinsp;% larger in diameter during nutrient-rich, upwelling times when food supply was abundant, indicating that shell growth in this aragonite-supersaturated basin is controlled by food availability. This study produces a baseline dataset of the variability in shell characteristics of <i>H. inflatus</i> pteropods in the Cariaco Basin and documents the controls on alteration of specimens captured via sediment traps. The methodology outlined for assessing shell parameters establishes a protocol for generating similar baseline records for pteropod populations globally. ?? 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

QVS95ACI,10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00017,Aliphatic Polyester-Based Biodegradable Microbeads for Sustainable Cosmetics,"Marine pollution stemming from plastic microbeads (MBs) in personal care products has been substantially increased because of their nonbiodegradability and high adsorption capacity against persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in seawater. Moreover, the manufacturing process of MBs has been based on wet processes, such as emulsification, microfluidics, and precipitation. Therefore, a green process for obtaining biodegradable MBs is urgently necessary. Aliphatic polyesters, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA, radiation-degradable) and poly(??-caprolactone) (PCL, radiation-cross-linkable), have biodegradability and melt processability. The eco-friendly melt electrospraying process is a simple and cost-effective method for the preparation of MBs without the need for organic reagents. In this study, the PLA and PCL MBs were obtained by adjusting the main processing parameters during the melt electrospraying process. The weight losses of PLA and PCL MBs in aqueous environments occurred faster than those of positive controls, and the thermal transition parameters were decreased with the hydrolytic degradation of MBs. In the POP adsorption test, the biodegradable MBs showed poor adsorption because of their low specific surface area. The results of the cleansing efficiency test indicated that biodegradable MBs have great potential as more sustainable cosmetics to replace nondegradable MBs. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

The abundance of microplastics in the cold basin affected by the Greenland Sea Gyre was 2.43 ?? 0.84 items/L. Fiber accounted for 87.2% of the total microplastics, and the proportions of transparent and 0.1?€?0.5 mm particles were 87.6% and 63.9%, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on size spectrum data revealed that the spatial pattern of microplastics was closely related to ocean currents and the station position in the ocean current. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis illustrated that the microplastics had many weathering and exfoliation sites and adsorbed heavy metals onto their surfaces. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) analysis showed that the microplastics in the Nordic Seas were mainly polyester and polyethylene. These results not only provide the latest data on microplastic pollution in the Nordic Seas, but also give evidence that ocean currents affect the transport of marine microplastics. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
VWPE3R4P,10.1021/acsami.9b22748,Highly Branched Copolymers with Degradable Bridges for Antifouling Coatings,"The antifouling properties of traditional self-polishing marine antifouling coatings are mainly achieved based on their hydrolysis-sensitive side groups or the degradable polymer main chains. Here, we prepared a highly branched copolymer for self-polishing antifouling coatings, in which the primary polymer chains are bridged by degradable fragments (poly-??-caprolactone, PCL). Owing to the partial or complete degradation of PCL fragments, the remaining coating on the surface can be broken down and eroded by seawater. Finally, the polymeric surface is self-polished and self-renewed. The designed highly branched copolymers were successfully prepared by reversible complexation mediated polymerization (RCMP), and their primary main chains had an Mn of approximately 3410 g??mol-1. The hydrolytic degradation results showed that the degradation of the copolymer was controlled, and the degradation rate increased with increasing contents of degradable fragments. The algae settlement assay tests indicated that the copolymer itself has some antibiofouling ability. Moreover, the copolymer can serve as a controlled release matrix for antifoulant 4,5-dichloro-2-octylisothiazolone (DCOIT), and the release rate increases with the contents of degradable fragments. The marine field tests confirmed that these copolymer-based coatings exhibited excellent antibiofouling ability for more than 3 months. The current copolymer is derived from commonly used monomers and an easily conducted polymerization method. Hence, we believe this method may offer innovative insights into marine antifouling applications. Copyright ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",
DTQZLPB9,10.1021/acs.est.9b07061,Microstructure Characterization of Oceanic Polyethylene Debris,"Plastic pollution has become a worldwide concern. It was demonstrated that plastic breaks down to nanoscale particles in the environment, forming so-called nanoplastics. It is important to understand their ecological impact, but their structure is not elucidated. In this original work, we characterize the microstructure of oceanic polyethylene debris and compare it to the nonweathered objects. Cross sections are analyzed by several emergent mapping techniques. We highlight deep modifications of the debris within a layer a few hundred micrometers thick. The most intense modifications are macromolecule oxidation and a considerable decrease in the molecular weight. The adsorption of organic pollutants and trace metals is also confined to this outer layer. Fragmentation of the oxidized layer of the plastic debris is the most likely source of nanoplastics. Consequently the nanoplastic chemical nature differs greatly from plastics. Copyright ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",
FS92ZEB5,10.1021/acs.est.9b07527,Transport and Burial of Microplastics in Deep-Marine Sediments by Turbidity Currents,"The threat posed by plastic pollution to marine ecosystems and human health is under increasing scrutiny. Much of the macro- and microplastic in the ocean ends up on the seafloor, with some of the highest concentrations reported in submarine canyons that intersect the continental shelf and directly connect to terrestrial plastic sources. Gravity-driven avalanches, known as turbidity currents, are the primary process for delivering terrestrial sediment and organic carbon to the deep sea through submarine canyons. However, the ability of turbidity currents to transport and bury plastics is essentially unstudied. Using flume experiments, we investigate how turbidity currents transport microplastics, and their role in differential burial of microplastic fragments and fibers. We show that microplastic fragments become relatively concentrated within the base of turbidity currents, whereas fibers are more homogeneously distributed throughout the flow. Surprisingly, the resultant deposits show an opposing trend, as they are enriched with fibers, rather than fragments. We explain this apparent contradiction by a depositional mechanism whereby fibers are preferentially removed from suspension and buried in the deposits as they are trapped between settling sand-grains. Our results suggest that turbidity currents potentially distribute and bury large quantities of microplastics in seafloor sediments. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

Here, we present the results of a sampling campaign to assess the vertical distribution of MP particles (&gt;11 ??m) at five stations of the HAUSGARTEN observatory. Water column samples were taken with large volume pumps by filtering 218-561 L of seawater at two to four depth strata (near-surface, ??&amp;circ;??300 m, ??&amp;circ;??1000 m, and above seafloor), and sediment samples were taken with a multiple corer. MP concentrations in the water column ranged between 0 and 1287 N m-3 and in the sediment from 239 to 13????331 N kg-1. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) imaging with automated data analysis showed that polyamide (39%) and ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (23%) were the most abundant polymers within the water samples and polyethylene-chlorinated (31%) in sediments. MPs ??? 25 ??m accounted for more than half of the synthetic particles in every sample. The largest MP particle recorded was in the 200 ??m size class. The concentrations of fibers were not reported, as fiber detection by FTIR imaging was not available at the time of analyses. Two- A nd three-dimensional simulations of particle transport trajectories suggest different pathways for certain polymer types. A positive correlation between MP size composition and particulate organic carbon indicates interactions with biological processes in the water column. Copyright ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",
NVCVZRP8,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b07397,Chitosan -Graft-Poly(dimethylsiloxane)/Zein Coatings for the Fabrication of Environmentally Friendly Oil- And Water-Resistant Paper,"Excessive use of synthetic nondegradable polymers has led to the proliferation of microplastics in the oceans as well as polluted landscapes. Herein, we report a new sustainable approach for the development of oil- and water-resistant paper. Chitosan-graft-poly(dimethylsiloxane) (CHI-g-PDMS) copolymers were prepared by the reaction of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) with chitosan. The CHI-g-PDMS graft copolymer was characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Zein, a coproduct of the bioethanol industry, was blended with CHI-g-PDMS in a water/ethanol solution and subsequently applied as a coating on an unbleached Kraft paper. The coated paper substrates were evaluated for their oil resistance via kit rating and oil contact angle measurements, while the water resistance was determined via Cobb60 value and water contact angle measurements. In addition, the pulp was successfully recovered from the coated paper. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to investigate the variation in the texture of the paper before and after the coating treatment. Thanks to the efficient pulp recovery and the biodegradable nature of the coating ingredients (chitosan and zein), this novel water- and oil-resistant paper will positively impact the environment by offering potential replacements for single-use plastic applications, and will thus help to minimize ocean microplastics and the burdens placed on landfills.

Much of the focus has been on the marine environment, with little information on the hazard posed by debris accumulating on beaches and adjacent vegetated areas. Here we investigate the potential for beach debris to disrupt terrestrial species and ecosystems on two remote islands. The significant quantities of debris on the beaches, and throughout the coastal vegetation, create a significant barrier which strawberry hermit crabs (Coenobita perlatus) encounter during their daily activities. Around 61,000 (2.447 crabs/m2) and 508,000 crabs (1.117 crabs/m2) are estimated to become entrapped in debris and die each year on Henderson Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, respectively. Globally, there is an urgent need to establish a clear link between debris interactions and population persistence, as loss of biodiversity contributes to ecosystem degradation. Our findings show accumulating debris on these islands has the potential to seriously impact hermit crab populations. This is important for countless other islands worldwide where crabs and debris overlap, as crabs play a crucial role in the maintenance of tropical ecosystems. ?? 2019 The Authors",

TXRCMSM9,10.3390/ijerph17082808,The complex toxicity of tetracycline with polystyrene spheres on gastric cancer cells,"Nowadays, microplastics (MPs) exist widely in the marine. The surface has strong adsorption capacity for antibiotics in natural environments, and the cytotoxicity of complex are poorly understood. In the study, 500 nm polystyrene (PS-MPs) and 60 nm nanoplastics (PS-NPs) were synthesized. The adsorption of PS to tetracycline (TC) was studied and their toxicity to gastric cancer cells (AGS) was researched. The adsorption experimental results show that PS absorbing capacity increased with increasing TC concentrations. The defense mechanism results show that 60 nm PS-NPs, 500 nm PS-MPs and their complex induce different damage to AGS cells. Furthermore, 600 mg/L PS-NPs and PS-MPs decline cell viability, induce oxidation stress and cause apoptosis. There is more serious damage of 60 nm PS-NPs than 500 nm PS-MPs in cell viability and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). DNA are also damaged by 60 nm PS-NPs and PS-TC NPs, 500 nm PS-MPs and PS-TC MPs, and 60 nm PS-NPs damage DNA more serious than 500 nm PS-MPs. Moreover, 60 nm PS-NPs and PS-TC NPs seem to promote bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) overexpression.

P3Z3BH4I,10.1080/10643389.2019.1631990,Plastic ingestion by marine fish in the wild,"Marine plastic pollution has become a prominent environmental issue in the recent years. Plastic ingestion is of special concern, as its magnitude and consequences for marine organisms and potentially humans are still largely unknown. We reviewed 93 papers on plastic ingestion by wild marine fish published since 1972. Plastic ingestion was detected in 323 (65%) of 494 examined fish species, and in 262 (67%) of 391 examined commercial fish species. These proportions are likely greater, as a detailed analysis of the sampling effort and analytical methods used in the reviewed studies suggests an underestimation of plastic ingestion in some assessments. A significant positive relationship (R = + 0.845, p = 0.004) was found between the sample size up to N = 10 and the detection of plastic ingestion. We also found significant differences in detection and frequency of occurrence (FO, %) of plastic ingestion among the three main types of analytical methods: naked-eye, microscopic analysis and chemical digestion. The chemical digestion method, which is also the most robust laboratory method, had the greatest detection (86%) and the highest FO (37.6 ?? 0.6%). To avoid the underestimation of plastic ingestion in future work, we provided recommendations for sample sizes and laboratory analysis. ?? 2019, ?? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Using the survey data of beach tourism along the East China Sea, this paper develops a theoretical model to clarify the impact of length of stay based on the travel cost model with on-site time endogenous. The result shows that the impact of marine litter on tourism revenue is statistically significant with the channel setting of length of stay. The finding remains robust even when the different regression techniques and endogeneity of length-of-stay cases are involved. Moreover, the loss of tourism revenue attributable to tourists?€? length of stay as affected by waste is considerable.

EJ5K6FCU,10.5194/gmd-13-1763-2020,On the calculation of normalized viscous-plastic sea ice stresses,"Calculating and plotting the normalized states of stress for viscous-plastic sea ice models is a common diagnostic for evaluating the numerical convergence and the physical consistency of a numerical solution. Researchers, however, usually do not explain how they calculate the normalized stresses. Here, we argue that care must be taken when calculating and plotting the normalized states of stress. A physically consistent and numerically converged solution should exhibit normalized stresses that are inside (viscous) or on (plastic) the normalized yield curve. To do so, two possible mistakes need to be avoided. First, when using an implicit solver, normalized stresses should be computed from viscous coefficients and replacement pressure calculated using the previous numerical iterate and the strain rates at the numerator calculated from the latest iterate. Calculating the stresses only from the latest iterate falsely indicates that the solution has numerically converged. Second, for both implicit and explicit (i.e., the EVP) solvers, the stresses should be normalized by the ice strength and not by the replacement pressure. Using the latter, normalized states of stress only lie on the yield curve (i.e., falsely indicating there are no viscous states of stress). ?? Author(s) 2020.

KQLISRHP,10.3390/W12040951,High-Resolution mapping of Japanese microplastic and macroplastic emissions from the land into the sea,"Plastic debris presents a serious hazard to marine ecosystems worldwide. In this study, we developed a method to evaluate high-resolution maps of plastic emissions from the land into the sea offshore of Japan without using mismanaged plastic waste. Plastics were divided into microplastics (MicPs) and macroplastics (MacPs), and correlations between the observed MicP concentrations in rivers and basin characteristics, such as the urban area ratio and population density, were used to evaluate nationwide MicP concentration maps. A simple water balance analysis was used to calculate the annual outflow for each 1 km mesh to obtain the final MicP emissions, and the MacP input was evaluated based on the MicP emissions and the ratio of MacP/MicP obtained according to previous studies. Concentration data revealed that the MicP concentrations and basin characteristics were significantly and positively correlated. Water balance analyses demonstrated that our methods performed well for evaluating the annual flow rate, while reducing the computational load. The total plastic input (MicP + MacP) was widely distributed from 210-4776 t/yr and a map showed that plastic emissions were high for densely populated and highly urbanized areas in the Tokyo metropolitan area, as well as other large urban areas, especially Nagoya and Osaka. These results provide important insights that may be used to develop countermeasures against plastic pollution and the methods employed herein can also be used to evaluate plastic emissions in other regions. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

Sediments and marine organisms are recognized as the carriers and final destinations of microplastics. However, research on the concentration and abundance of microplastics in deep-sea sediments and organisms is limited. In this study, samples of sediments and organisms were collected from deep-sea locations of the western Pacific Ocean, with the depth ranging from 4601 m to 5732 m. Microplastics were extracted from the samples and analyzed by micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The average abundance of microplastics in the sediments was 240 items per kg dry weight of sediment. The microplastics were predominantly fibrous in shape (52.5%), blue in color (45.0%), and less than 1 mm in size (90.0%). The most commonly detected polymers were poly(propylene-ethylene) copolymer (40.0%) and polyethylene terephthalate (27.5%). The concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are representatives of persistent organic pollutants, in the pore water of sediment samples were also investigated. A significant correlation between the distribution of microplastics and the PCB concentrations in sediments was found (P = 0.016). Microplastics were also detected in deep-sea organisms (i.e., Crinoidea, Pheronematidae, Ophiuroidea, and Gammaridea) in the sampling region, with an abundance of 0?€?3 items per individual biological sample. This assessment of microplastics in deep-sea sediments and benthic organisms of the western Pacific Ocean confirms that microplastic pollution exists in the deep-sea ecosystems of this region. ?? 2020 The microplastic pollution in deep-sea sediments and organisms of the western Pacific Ocean were investigated. ?? 2020",

This study monitored their in the scats (N = 205) of four pinniped species/subspecies at five different locations in the southern Pacific Ocean (Peru and Chile). Samples from all rookeries contained microplastics, and overall, 68% of the examined scats contained fragments/fibers, mostly blue colored. We confirmed that 81.5% of the fragments/fibers were anthropogenic in origin, but only 30% were polymers. Scats from Juan Fern??ndez Archipelago presented higher microplastic concentrations than continental rookeries. Also, the common diet in each location may influence the levels found in the samples.

Rising levels of microplastics (MP) in rivers and oceans are a big challenge for our economy and regulatory institutions as well as from a scientific point of view. Smaller microplastic particles, in particular, are especially hard to identify and even harder to quantify in environmental samples. Hence, we present a novel and inexpensive approach to quantify microplastics (MP) on a weight basis, relying on a thermoanalytical method. The Elemental Analysis combined with Overdetermined Equation Method (EA-OEM) was originally developed for determining the plastic content of refuse-derived fuels. It makes use of the distinct differences in the organic elemental composition (C, H, N, S, O) of plastics, biogenic and inorganic materials to calculate the (micro)plastic content on a detailed weight base. The study presented provides the first experimental results yielded from the application of the EA-OEM and two different laboratory approaches to the analysis of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) MP content in industrial effluent samples from one source.

This is placed within the context of private certification schemes and private governance as mechanisms to increase consumer conscientiousness, establish a higher environmental standard in terms of microplastic and reduce marine pollution. We find that consumers in general are very conscious about the issue, would generally prefer products that are microplastics free, but would seldom choose these when there is a price premium on the label.

Regarding the microplastics-zooplankton ratio, values were obtained between 0.002 and 0.22. In Las Canteras, the highest accumulation zone, was found twice as much microplastics as zooplankton for the 1?€?5 mm fraction in dry weight. These values highlight the potential hazard of microplastics ?€? and its associated chemical contaminants ?€? for marine biota, especially for large filter feeders. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In October, sediment and holothurian samples from seventeen sampling sites from Croatian Islands characterized by different levels of protection (Silba n = 7; Tela????ica MPA n = 10) were collected. Collected particles ranged in sediments within 113.4?€?377.8 items/kg d.w., and in holothurians within 0.6?€?9.4 items/animal, showing sizes within 1.4?€?10,493 ??m. In holothurians, cellulose and cellulose acetate (non-synthetic materials) mean percentages were within 5.0?€?12.7% of the total amount of particles. Nylon fibres ranged within 0?€?26.7%; while PP, PE, PA, and PS% were more abundant than in sediments. Among factors of variability tested, ?€?island group?€? and ?€?level of protection?€? resulted to affect plastic composition in sediments. Otherwise, other environmental factors (i.e. orientation, morphology of sampling site, P. oceanica) were significantly related to chemical composition of microplastic ingested by holothurians. ?? 2018",

Experiments exposing fishes and invertebrates to constant concentrations of microplastics often yield high variation in particle ingestion rates among individuals. Yet, despite an increasing interest in microplastic ingestion in the wild, the potential intrinsic drivers of inter-individual variation have received little attention so far. Here we assessed individual-level ingestion of Polyethylene microspheres by laboratory-reared juvenile anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris, in relation to (a) ambient particle concentrations and (b) repeatable behavioural traits. We show that microplastic ingestion is highly variable at all tested particle concentrations and that this variation can partially be explained by individual activity levels. Moreover, the relationship between ingestion and behavioural variation increased notably when only the most behaviourally consistent individuals (n = 40 out of 60) were considered in the analysis. Our findings indicate that microplastic ingestion rates in juvenile reef fishes may be less dependent on ambient concentrations than expected; instead they are to some degree phenotype-dependent. Care should thus be taken when reporting mean responses to microplastic exposure treatments, because some individuals may not be affected in the same way as others due to differential ingestion behaviour. We also discuss potential ramifications of non-random ingestion variability on population- and community-level responses. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

This is the first study to focus on adult sea urchins (Arbacia punctulata). These organisms were exposed to storm-like sediment resuspension of microplastic concentrations (9-??m polystyrene 25,000 spheres L???1) combined with salinity reductions (salinity 25 vs. 33) associated with high precipitation. Urchins were exposed to these parameters for 24 h before assessing righting times and for 48 h before assessing oxygen consumption rates. No significant impacts on urchin physiology were observed showing resilience to short-term exposures of storm-like induced microplastics and salinity. No microplastic particles blocked the madreporite pores indicating the active removal of particles by cilia and pedicellariae. Gut tissue samples indicated consumption of microplastics.

Food items of 214 individuals of Opisthonema oglinum, Bagre marinus, Cathorops spixii, Sciades herzbergii, Chloroscombrus chrysurus, Conodon nobilis, Haemulopsis corvinaeformis were analyzed. The species were classified according to their trophic guilds (zoobenthivorous or opportunistic/omnivorous). All species ingested microplastic and contamination occurred independently of the trophic guild. Of the sampled fish, 55% were contaminated by microplastic. The most consumed categories were blue (28%) and transparent filaments (20%). Raman spectroscopy measurements detected that most sampled filament corresponds to blue synthetic fiber (polyester).

The degradation of conventional and biobased materials was evaluated through a laboratory experiment for a year simulating four different conditions in the marine environment. The water column environmental compartment was simulated under euphotic and aphotic (with and without light availability) conditions. The seafloor environmental compartment was simulated with sediment under non-polluted and polluted conditions. By combining weight loss (%), spectroscopic and thermal analyses, the degradation patterns regarding the polymer structure were assessed. The studied biobased materials were polylactic acid (PLA) based materials and showed higher degradability than conventional ones. The weight loss of conventional materials was not influenced by the water column or sediment, while in PLA-based materials, the degradation rates were ca. 5 times greater in the sediment than in the water column. The absorbance (Abs) value at 3400 cm???1 for polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and carbonyl (CO) index for PET and PLA could be useful to detect early signs of degradation. The crystallization index could be a useful parameter to discriminate degradation stages. The obtained results highlight the different degradability rates of materials depending on the specific environmental marine conditions. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

However, the effects of microplastic pollution on animal behaviour and cognition are poorly understood. We used shell selection in common European hermit crabs (Pagurus bernhardus) as a model to test whether microplastic exposure impacts the essential survival behaviours of contacting, investigating and entering an optimal shell. We kept 64 female hermit crabs in tanks containing either polyethylene spheres (n = 35) or no plastic (n = 29) for 5 days. We then transferred subjects into suboptimal shells and placed them in an observation tank with an optimal alternative shell. Plastic-exposed hermit crabs showed impaired shell selection: they were less likely than controls to contact optimal shells or enter them. They also took longer to contact and enter the optimal shell. Plastic exposure did not affect time spent investigating the optimal shell. These results indicate that microplastics impair cognition (information-gathering and processing), disrupting an essential survival behaviour in hermit crabs. ?? 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Three study sites are located in the eastern waters (Pak Lap Wan, Stanley Bay, Tung Lung Chau) and the other three in the western waters (Tai Pai Tsui, Ha Pak Nai, Shui Hau Wan). The three most abundant types of microplastics were polyethylene (42.2%), polypropylene (23.3%) and polystyrene (19.5%). The median concentration of Fe (302 mg kg???1) was the highest and followed by Zn (19.6 mg kg???1) and Mn (18.6 mg kg???1).

RKED9JCP,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.113937,"Translocation, trophic transfer, accumulation and depuration of polystyrene microplastics in Daphnia magna and Pimephales promelas","In recent years, reports of plastic debris in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of fish have been well documented in the scientific literature. This, in turn, increased concerns regarding human health exposure to microplastics through the consumption of contaminated fish. Most of the available research regarding microplastic toxicity has focused on marine organisms through direct feeding or waterborne exposures at the individual level. However, little is known about the trophic transfer of microplastics through the aquatic food chain. Freshwater zooplankton Daphnia magna (hereafter Daphnia), and the fathead minnow Pimephales promelas (FHM), are well-known model species used in standard toxicological studies and ecological risk assessments that provide a simple model for trophic transfer. The aim of this study was to assess the tissue translocation, trophic transfer, and depuration of two concentrations (20 and 2000-part ml???1) of 6 ??m polystyrene (PS) microplastics particles between Daphnia and FHM. Bioconcentration factors (BCF) and bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were determined. Fluorescent microscopy was used to determine the number of particles in the water media and within the organs of both species. Throughout the five days of exposure, PS particles were only found within the GI tract of both species. The BCF for Daphnia was 0.034 ?? 0.005 for the low concentration and 0.026 ?? 0.006 for the high concentration. The BAF for FHM was 0.094 ?? 0.037 for the low concentration and 0.205 ?? 0.051 for the high concentration. Between 72 and 96 h after exposure all microplastic particles were depurated from both species. The presence of food had a significant effect on the depuration of microplastic particles from Daphnia but not for FHM. Based on the low BCF and BAF values for both species, rapid depuration rates, and null translocation of microplastic particles to organs and tissues from the GI tract, there is a low probability that microplastics will bioconcentrate and bioaccumulate under environmental conditions. Low uptake, null translocation, and short retention time, indicate a low probability that 6 ??m PS microplastics will bioconcentrate and bioaccumulate under environmentally relevant conditions. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In addition, an evaluation on the contribution from the local sewage treatment plant to MP levels was undertaken. In general, low levels of MP in water and sediments were detected, but significant differences were observed among sites. The sewage treatment plant was shown to contribute to MP levels in sediment but not in water. Species ingestion of MP was high and associated with MP in sediments.

A systemic understanding of this issue is key to reducing marine plastic waste and to avoid its irreversible effects. Reducing the inflow of waste does not necessarily reduce the waste accumulated in the ocean, unless its rate becomes smaller than the outflow (e.g., cleanup). Delays due to a wait-and-see policy will result in irreversible effects, such as animals swallowing plastic waste, and plastic waste becoming microplastics that are difficult to clean up. A questionnaire survey was conducted during workshops and poster sessions at an event for sustainability in Japan. Participants were children from fourth grade to high school (9-18 years old). Participants were shown to have a limited systematic understanding of marine plastic waste. The majority incorrectly adopted pattern matching (70.6%) and failed to draw correct inflow and outflow curves (94.1%). The majority (83.6%) did not point out delay issues.

In the marine environment, larger plastic pieces may degrade into nanoscale (<100 nm in at least one dimension) plastic particles due to natural weathering effects. We observe that the presence of 20 nm plastic nanoparticles at concentrations below 200 ppm had no impact on planktonic growth of a panel of heterotrophic marine bacteria. However, the presence of plastic nanoparticles significantly impacted the formation of biofilms in a species-specific manner. While carboxylated nanoparticles increased the amount of biofilm formed by several species, amidine-functionalized nanoparticles decreased the amount of biofilm of many but not all bacteria. Further experiments suggested that the aggregation dynamics of bacteria and nanoparticles were strongly impacted by the surface properties of the nanoparticles. The community structure of an artificially constructed community of marine bacteria was significantly altered by exposure to plastic nanoparticles, with differently functionalized nanoparticles selecting for unique and reproducible community abundance patterns. These results suggest that surface properties and concentration of plastic nanoparticles, as well as species interactions, are important factors determining how plastic nanoparticles impact biofilm formation by marine bacteria. ?? 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",

This study collected underwater videos on shelf-indenting canyons (the Gioia and Petrace Canyon) and adjacent sectors to characterize benthic litter and its distribution patterns. A high density of litter was present in the canyon thalwegs (up to 56.3 items/100 m), where ???95 % of observed debris was concentrated. Litter primarily comprised of plastic (???90 %). The presence of household objects intermingled with vegetal material indicates a strong influence of land-based sources for litter in these areas. Sedimentary gravity flow processes transported natural and anthropogenic debris downslope and may determine its burial beneath the seafloor. Another litter transport mechanism is the presence of light items, observed while drifting above the seafloor under the action of down-canyon bottom currents. This phenomenon was frequently documented within Gioia Canyon, where up to 74 drifting items were counted in one hour of video. Conversely, a lower litter concentration was found along the continental margin, where items were mostly fishing-related. Findings from this study confirm that canyons act as conduits for land-sourced debris and litter transport from coastal to deep-sea environments. The funnelling of a large amount of plastic to the deep sea through multiple processes indicates that the magnitude of this pollution may be greater than expected. This pollution could concentrate in canyons along continental margins and possibly at the mouths of canyons at the base of the slope. This issue requires urgent attention, as understanding of deep-sea litter distribution is still limited and potential impacts to benthic ecosystems are poorly understood. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Microplastics were picked, photographed and identified using FT-IR microscopy: in water samples, 57.9% of items including suspect items were selected to identify; all microplastics found in shrimp samples were identified. Microplastics were present in the surface waters of all sites, with an average abundance of 0.40 ?? 0.27 items/L.

Transcriptomic analysis revealed 191 significantly upregulated and 71 significantly downregulated genes at 7 d after microplastic exposure. Fifteen GO terms were overrepresented for these significantly upregulated genes, which were grouped into four categories including transmembrane ion transport, substrate-specific transmembrane transporter activity, calcium ion binding, and calcium-dependent cysteine-type endopeptidase activity. Thirteen of the significantly upregulated genes encode metal ion transporter and ammonium transporter, and five light-harvesting protein genes were among the significantly downregulated genes. These results demonstrate that microplastics can act as an exogenous stressor, suppress detoxification activity, nutrient uptake, and photosynthesis, elevate oxidative stress, and raise the apoptosis level through upregulating ion transport and apoptotic enzymes to repress the growth of C. goreaui. These effects have implications in negative impacts of microplastics on coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis that involves C. goreaui. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

An approach based on a mesoscale circulation model combined with a particle tracking model is applied. It is established that the litter distribution is nearly independent of the source location and is mainly controlled by the basin circulation system. The western gyre predominantly accumulates floating debris in summer. After the integration of the main cyclonic current in winter, the debris in the inner basin moves east. Retention zones along the south-western coast persist in time. The mean particle stranding time is estimated at about 200 days. Accumulation zones along the south-eastern and eastern coast are abundant in summer, and then move further northeast and north. Simulations demonstrate an increasing litter accumulation in summer on the North Western Shelf and shelf break. ?? 2020 The Authors",

In this paper, we assessed the effects of chemical pollutants, grain size and plastic litter on functional traits, biodiversity and biotic indices. The study was conducted on the benthic communities of three harbours in the central Mediterranean Sea: Malta, Augusta and Syracuse, subjected to different levels of anthropogenic stress (high, medium and low, respectively). Six traits were considered, subdivided into 22 categories: reproductive frequency, environmental position, mobility, life habit, feeding habit and bioturbation. Functional diversity indices analysed were: Functional Divergence, Quadratic Entropy, Functional Evenness and Functional Richness. To assess the trait responses to environmental gradients, we applied RLQ analysis, which considers simultaneously the relationship between three components: environmental data (R), species abundances (L) and species traits (Q). From our analyses, significant relationships (P-value = 0.0018 for permutation of samples, and P-value = 0.00027 for permutation of species) between functional traits and environmental data were highlighted. The trait categories significantly influenced by environmental variables were those representing feeding habits and mobility. In particular, the first category was influenced by chemical pollutants (organotin compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and grain size (silt and sand), while the latter category was influenced only by chemical pollutants. Pearson correlations performed for functional vs biotic and diversity indices confirmed the validity of the chosen conceptual framework for harbour environments. Finally, linear models assessing the influence of stressors on functional parameters underlined the link between environmental data vs benthic and functional indices. Our results highlight the fact that functional trait analysis provides a useful and fast method for detecting in greater depth the effects of multiple stressors on functional diversity in marine ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In this paper, the effects of different operating conditions (temperature, time, feedstock concentration, pressure) on gasification performance were discussed. The gasification kinetic of microplastics in supercritical water was calculated. The experimental results showed that the increase in gasification temperature and time enhanced the cracking reaction and free radical reaction of the microplastics to increase the gasification efficiency, while the reduction in feedstock concentration improved the gasification efficiency by increasing the gasification level of unit feedstock. The change in pressure had no significant effect on gasification due to the fact that the properties of the supercritical water were not significantly changed. It was found that the valuable results that all alkali metal salts in seawater promote hydrogen conversion, while in terms of carbon conversion, only KCl, CaCl2, NaHCO3 and seawater had a significant catalytic effect on the gasification. Seawater gasification of microplastics was a potential resource utilization method. Finally, it was considered that the PC plastic gasification conformed to the random nucleation and subsequent growth model (n = 3), and the reaction activation energy was 230.45 kJ/mol, which was smaller than that of traditional pyrolysis. ?? 2019 Energy Institute",

We tested whether anthropogenic debris ingestion influence the nutritional niches of endangered green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in estuarine and reef habitats on the Brazilian coast. Our results showed that estuarine turtles consumed diets with lower proportional wet mass composition of protein (P) and water (W) than their reef conspecifics. The amounts of debris, mostly plastics, retrieved from the digestive tracts of estuarine turtles were higher compared with those individuals from reefs. The realized nutritional niche from estuarine turtles was subject to the debris density in the environment, lack of benthic food resources available and the surface foraging behavior, likely preventing them from reaching their nutritional goals and resulting in lower fitness. The study provides critical information for the management and conservation of ecologically threatened individuals, populations, and their natural habitats. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Studies have been called to analyze the bearing performance of small-spaced row piles subjected to lateral loads. A numerical investigation of laterally loaded row piles with small pile spacing was conducted to achieve a fitted algebraic expression of the P-Y curve. Significantly different from the hyperbolic P-Y curves of a single pile reported in other studies, the P-Y curve of small-spaced row piles is similar to an elastic- perfectly plastic curve, which simply depends on the ultimate lateral bearing capacity of piles (Pu) and initial slope of curves (Ki). Parametric studies have revealed that Pu and Ki values are affected by pile spacing, depth, untrained shear strength of soil, and relative soil-pile rigidity. Algebraic expression of the P-Y curve could be employed for the subgrade reaction method and be effectively used in predicting the behavior of small-spaced row piles, such as PWFSs. ?? 2020 National Taiwan Ocean University.

The current study aims to investigate biofilm formation on plastic strips in aquatic ecosystems using a simple physicochemical method commonly used to characterize solid surfaces, namely, the diffuse reflectance UV?€?Vis spectroscopy (DRS) method. Using virgin polymers that have not being exposed to the environment as a reference, DRS peaks can be attributed to the microorganisms attached to the polymer surface with time. The polymers tested were low?€?density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). For LDPE strips for all sampling times in the field, the development of the peaks among 10 similar samples was rather uniform in terms of peak wavelength with time. For PET strips during the early sampling time, the development of the peaks among 10 similar samples was rather uniform in terms of peak wavelength but varied in terms of intensity. This last observation phased out with longer exposure times that the peaks had similar distribution in terms of peak wavelength and intensity. Similar experiments were run for longer exposure times both in an oligotrophic laboratory bioreactor and in the marine environment. In both cases, the biofilm on PET samples seems to reach a steady state faster than LDPE with similar peaks found on both samples DRS proved to be a robust and useful tool to study the formation of biofilm on plastic samples without any pretreatment and without sample destruction.

This study investigated the abundance, composition and sources of marine litter stranded on five beaches located at the bay of Durres and the Bay of Lalzi in Albania. During April 2018, a total of 3,321 marine litter items were collected, classified and recorded. Within this study the mean litter density was found to be 0.14 items/m2 and 333 items/100m stretch of beach. The sites investigated differed in terms of human-induced pressures with 2 sites being classified as semi-urban; 2 sites as urban and 1 as semi-rural. Artificial/anthropogenic polymer materials accounted for the majority of marine litter items found, with a percentage of 65%. The most abundant type of items was glass and ceramic fragments accounting for 19.7%, followed by cigarette butts and filters accounting for 17.9% of all litter collected. The vast majority of litter items (58.5%) originated from shoreline sources including poor waste management practices, tourism and recreational activities. Single-use plastics (SUPs) accounted for 48% of all items recorded ranging from 16.8% to 69.1% for the different beaches. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

A trait-based analysis on salt marsh species,"Salt marshes in urban watersheds are prone to microplastics (MP) pollution due to their hydrological characteristics and exposure to urban runoff, but little is known about MP distributions in species from these habitats. In the current study, MP occurrence was determined in six benthic invertebrate species from salt marshes along the North Adriatic lagoons (Italy) and the Schelde estuary (Netherlands). The species represented different feeding modes and sediment localisation. 96% of the analysed specimens (330) did not contain any MP, which was consistent across different regions and sites. Suspension and facultative deposit-feeding bivalves exhibited a lower MP occurrence (0.5?€?3%) relative to omnivores (95%) but contained a much more variable distribution of MP sizes, shapes and polymers. The study provides indications that MP physicochemical properties and species' ecological traits could all influence MP exposure, uptake and retention in benthic organisms inhabiting European salt marsh ecosystems. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
5F98CB6M,10.1016/j.envsci.2020.02.007,On replacing single-use plastic with so-called biodegradable ones: The case with straws,"Plastic pollution is a global environmental concern and several approaches have been implemented seeking to reduce and control releases of plastic waste, especially in marine environments. Recently, disclosure of data on occurrence of single-use plastic straws among the litter collected in beach cleaning campaigns unleashed a worldwide movement that resulted on banning of these items in several countries. The market then quickly began to offer sustainable solutions as the professed biodegradable plastic straws. However, cases of greenwashing added to current limitations related to the technical standards used to attest biodegradability of commercial plastic products may lead these measures to be largely ineffective. Herein, a case study assessing the composition of plastic straws marketed in Brazil and United States under false claims of biodegradability was used as background for discussion of this neglected issue, which goes far beyond plastics straws. Thus, although some local regulations have already banned single-use plastic products, additional actions in regional and global scales should be implemented, especially concerning proper labeling of the alleged biodegradable products. Therefore, from a multi-dimensional perspective and considering the resistance of the powerful plastic industry, multiple management strategies focused on educating people ?€? in the matters of deciding purchases based on correct labeling and properly discarding the waste ?€?, are possibly our best chance to drive a positive global environmental change. Additionally, we also suggest the inclusion of this relevant subject among the tasks proposed by the Basel Convention Partnership on Plastic Waste. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
ZRPWQ5ZM,10.1007/s00248-019-01424-5,Early Colonization of Weathered Polyethylene by Distinct Bacteria in Marine Coastal Seawater,"Plastic debris in aquatic environments is rapidly colonized by a diverse community of microorganisms, often referred to as the ?€?Plastisphere.?€? Given that common plastics are derived from fossil fuels, one would expect that Plastispheres should be enriched with obligate hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (OHCB). So far, though, different polymer types do not seem to exert a strong effect on determining the composition of the Plastisphere, and putative biodegrading bacteria are only found as rare taxa within these biofilms. Here, we show through 16S rRNA gene sequencing that the enrichment of a prominent OHCB member on weathered and non-weathered polyethylene only occurred at early stages of colonization (i.e., after 2 days of incubation in coastal marine water; 5.8% and 3.7% of relative abundance, respectively, vs. 0.6% on glass controls). As biofilms matured, these bacteria decreased in relative abundance on all materials (< 0.3% after 9 days). Apart from OHCB, weathered polyethylene strongly enriched for other distinct organisms during early stages of colonization, such as a specific member of the Roseobacter group and a member of the genus Aestuariibacter (median 26.9% and 1.8% of the community, respectively), possibly as a consequence of the availability of short-oxidized chains generated from weathering. Our results demonstrate that Plastispheres can vary in accordance with the weathering state of the material and that very early colonizing communities are enriched with taxa that can potentially degrade hydrocarbons. Given the lack of persistent enrichment and overall community convergence between materials over time, common non-hydrolysable polymers might not serve as an important source of carbon for mature Plastispheres once the labile substrates generated from weathering have been depleted. ?? 2019, The Author(s).",
R3FUFDGT,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105079,The rise and demise of plastic shopping bags in Chile ?€? Broad and informal coalition supporting ban as a first step to reduce single-use plastics,"Single-use plastic bags (SUPBs) were introduced to society as a way to facilitate our daily lives, but due to their low post-use value they are found as litter in many different environments, from urban to rural and remote, natural environments. Given the increasing awareness about environmental litter, many communities have banned SUPBs in the recent past. Here we explore an emerging economy to document the rise and demise of SUPBs in society. Through a review of scientific and grey literature (including governmental documents and media coverage) we reconstruct the timeline of SUPBs in Chile, including the development of the plastic industry and retail business within Chile, the introduction, spread and finally the demise of SUPBs. Focused on the demise phase, we document the creation and succession of municipal ordinances to reduce SUPBs in local commerce, and the development of a national law to regulate the use of SUPBs. In order to document the involvement of the general public during the demise phase, we also examined current behavior and behavioral intentions of people in (i) a local project introducing reusable cloth bags to reduce the use of SUPBs, and (ii) a consumer survey about public perception of SUPBs and their use. Plastic bags were introduced in Chile in the 1970s, then spread with the emergence of supermarkets and retail stores in the 1980s and 1990s, and were widely used in commerce by the turn of the century. During the first decade of the 21st century the first scientific studies reported large amounts of plastic litter and high proportions of single-use plastics in coastal environments, public awareness grew, and numerous initiatives aiming to reduce consumption and littering of plastics developed. The first municipal ban of SUPBs in 2013 was emulated during the following five years by 62 other Chilean municipalities and in 2018 translated into a national law, which was highly approved and supported by the population. We conclude that the ban of SUBPs in Chile was facilitated by a broad concern among the general public, which led to a bottom-up movement culminating in the national government taking stakes in the issue. Finally, we argue that this can only be a first step that must be followed by further actions to abolish single-use products in order to effectively protect the environment and in particular the world's oceans. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

At present, knowledge on basic plastic particle dynamics and the interaction with complex hydrodynamics is lacking. The present laboratory study, performed under controlled wave and wind conditions, demonstrates the dispersion of plastics in shallow waters.

The results show that both wind and waves as well as plastic properties (shape and density) govern the behaviour of plastic litter in the nearshore zone. Heavy particles behave like natural sand with accumulation in the wave breaking zone. Light particles have varying accumulation along the coastal profile depending on the wind, waves and particle shapes. More extensive characterization remains to be done in future studies. ?? 2018",

Adopting a temperature dependent elastic-perfectly plastic constitutive relation, the temperature dependent out-of-plane quasi-static compressive mechanical performance of Al5052 honeycomb is studied with the finite element method. The results show that the plateau stress, peak stress and specific energy absorption (SEA) of Al5052 honeycomb decrease gradually with increasing temperature, while the crush load efficiency (CLE) and deformation pattern are temperature insensitive. Then, based on the numerical results in this study and super folding element theory, the temperature dependent theoretical models without fitting parameters for the plateau stress and SEA of metallic honeycombs are developed, respectively. These theoretical models are successfully verified against numerical simulations and experiments.

The mechanical behaviours of axially loaded SSRCFSs were investigated. Two different parameters were considered: sea sand chloride ion (Cl-) content and recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) replacement percentage. Typical influences of sea sand Cl- and RCA contents on the bearing capacity, deformation and load-deformation curve of SSRCFS were studied. The test results showed that the typical failure mode of the SSRCFSs was similar to that of ordinary concrete filled steel tubes. The axial load-deformation curves of the SSRCFSs could be divided into elastic, plastic growth, declining and steady stages. It was found that the bearing capacity of SSRCFSs increased with decreasing RCA replacement percentage. The effect of sea sand Cl- content on the mechanical behaviour of the SSRCFSs decreased with an increase in RCA replacement percentage. The peak strain of the specimen could be enhanced due to the low modulus of the RCA, but this improvement decreased with increasing sea sand Cl- content. Finally, numerical expressions were developed to obtain the peak load and load-deformation curve of the SSRCFSs. The calculated results were in line with the experimental data. ?? 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",
WDGQS5AM,10.1016/j.jglr.2019.12.012,High levels of pelagic plastic pollution within the surface waters of Lakes Erie and Ontario,"During 2012 to 2014 five expeditions collected surface water samples for plastic pollution analysis representing the first data within Lake Ontario and the first multi-year dataset for Lake Erie. Lake Ontario had the highest abundances of any Great Lake to date with an average of over 230,000 particles/km2. Though having a considerable smaller average of 45,000 particles/km2, Lake Erie remains second only to Lake Ontario based on studies to date and averaged across all samples and years. The high levels of pelagic plastic pollution is likely owing to their position as the last two lakes in the Laurentian Great Lakes ecosystem, as well as the prominence of population centers along their shorelines. As with previous studies, most particles were found within the smallest size classification (0.355?€?0.999 mm; 73%), with fragments (63%) and pellets (26%) forming the dominant morphologies. The minor contribution of fibers/lines (4%) is consistent with previous Great Lakes studies, though not with studies within other environmental compartments (e.g., sediment, fish, atmospheric). This could be due to the negative buoyancy of polymeric fibrous materials, a hypothesis consistent with the dominance of the less dense polymers polyethylene (46%) and polypropylene (43%) (based on FTIR analysis). For the first time, the multiyear Lake Erie samples were compared to modeled plastic distributions and found to fit reasonably well. Using the sample data to calibrate the model we estimate that there are 475 million plastic particles, with a total mass of 6.45 metric tons, floating on the surface of Lake Erie alone. ?? 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research",
6B65DDYQ,10.1086/708678,Phenotypic variation in growth and gene expression under different photoperiods in Allopatric populations of the copepod Tigriopus Californicus,"Daylength is a major environmental condition that varies seasonally and predictably along a latitudinal cline, where higher latitudes exhibit greater ranges in total daylengths. Generally, the circadian clock acts as a network of genes whose expression dynamics are known to control daily rhythms in response to daylength, and it enables the control of many physiological processes such as growth and development. While well studied in many model animals, the influence of daylength variation on phenotypic evolution is poorly examined in marine species. In this study we demonstrate that two allopatric populations of the intertidal crustacean Tigriopus californicus exhibit plastic and divergent phenotypic responses to changes in daylength. Using common-garden experiments, we discovered that shorter daylengths promoted decreased adult body size and faster growth rates in the two divergent populations, suggesting a plastic response to shortened days. In addition, the higher-latitude population exhibited a faster growth rate at any daylength condition, indicating a fixed response, possibly as a result of adaptation to respective natural light regimes. Gene expression profiles of several circadian clock genes, monitored throughout the day by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, revealed that the key core clock genes reach higher daily transcription maxima in the southern population compared to the northern population, pointing to divergent strategies used to respond to changes in daylength. Many modifier genes to the circadian clock showed similar plastic responses to the different daylengths, supporting the existence of at least some conserved gene expression across both populations. Ultimately, our results suggest that photoperiod and daylength exert a potent selective pressure underexplored in marine systems and warranting further future research. ?? 2020 The University of Chicago.",

It is found that the load carrying capacity of a DTCC with SS as inner tube can be estimated as the sum of the loads carried by the outer tube with encased concrete and that by the inner SS tube. On the other hand, the load in a DTCC with FRP as inner tube could be divided as the loads carried by the outer tube with encased annular concrete and by the confined inner FRP tube with encased core concrete. Finally, based on existing analysis-oriented models for concrete fully filled tubes, theoretical models are proposed to predict the load-axial strain curves of DTCCs, which shows reasonable accuracy as verified by the experimental results. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Recent insight suggests that there are different physiological roles for DMSP based on the cellular DMSP concentrations in producers. Differential production of DMSP was tested with multiple physiological experiments that altered nitrate availability, salinity and temperature to create stressed growth and target different metabolic conditions in Emiliania huxleyi, a high DMSP producer and Thalassiosira oceanica, a low DMSP producer. Emiliania huxleyi intracellular DMSP did not respond to metabolically imbalanced conditions, while Thalassiosira oceanica intracellular DMSP was significantly correlated to stressed growth rate across all conditions tested and exhibited a plastic response on a timescale of hours in nonsteady-state. The previous assumption that proposed DMSP mechanism(s) can be universally applied to all producers is shown to be unlikely. Rather, two distinct ecological roles for DMSP likely exist that differ by producer type, where: (1) the primary role of DMSP in high producers is a constitutive compatible solute; and (2) DMSP production in low producers is a finely tuned stress response. ?? 2019 The Authors.

However, perforation could largely alter the structural responses and crashing behavior, thereby creating significant challenge in composite design. This study carried out a parametric study and design optimization on the perforation parameters for the perforated carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) square tubes to improve the structural crashworthiness. First, a finite element model was established for perforated square tube through experimental validation. Second, the support vector regression (SVR) surrogate models of the crashworthiness indices were established with respect to the perforation design variables following a parametric study. It was found that the radius of the hole had the most significant effect on crashworthiness performance of the CFRP tube, followed by the height-to-length ratio and the offset-to-width ratio of the hole. Finally, the multiobjective optimization was performed to optimize the perforated parameters by integrating the surrogate modeling technique and multiobjective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO). The optimal design enabled to enhance 100.47% in the specific energy absorption (SEA) (specifically from 29.61 J/g to 59.36 J/g) only with a minor sacrifice of 4.62% in the first peak load (Fmax) (from 81.22 kN to 84.97 kN). ?? 2020",

This study investigated the NH3 recovery potential and the related microbial community changes during thermophilic composting of shrimp pond sludges. Three sludges were collected from Malaysian shrimp farms: one was from an earthen pond, another from an earthen discharge channel adjacent to a plastic-lined pond, and one from a plastic-lined pond. The sludges were used as raw materials in examining the recovery of NH3 at three different temperatures using lab-scale composting reactors. Overall, the sludge from the plastic-lined pond produced the most NH3, 3.8 ?? 10???4 mol/g-dry of the solid sludge, 1.9?€?3.4 times and 17.2?€?24.0 times higher than those from the discharge-channel and earthen-pond sludges, respectively. The cumulative NH3 evolution was positively correlated with the volatile solid content of the sludge, clearly indicating that the amount of organic matter was the most important factor for recovering NH3 from shrimp pond sludge. High-throughput microbial community analysis revealed that the dynamics of major bacterial groups differed between sludges, possibly depending on the composition and/or the organic matter quality of the sludge. Rhodobacteraceae was dominant not only in the sludge but also during thermophilic composting of two sludges, suggesting this marine bacterium is one of the key degraders of shrimp pond sludge. Some distinct bacterial groups proliferated only in the discharge-channel sludge (e.g., Ureibacillus) or plastic-lined-pond sludge (e.g., Marinobacterium). This suggests that these bacterial groups played complementary roles in organic matter degradation and/or NH3 production during the thermophilic composting of shrimp pond sludge. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
RIUN84HC,10.24247/ijmperdapr2020114,Applications of friction stir welding and its advantages and limitations,"In this paper, the feasibility of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) of Aluminium alloy pipe with Stainless Steel plate is studied. Aluminium alloy and Stainless Steel are widely used in aerospace, automotive, marine, defense, construction etc. due to their high strength, low weight, high machinability, good conductivity of heat and electricity etc. Friction stir welding is preferred for joining these materials as it is a strong state produce welding procedure and issues related with welding of Aluminum amalgams and tempered steel can be stifled through this procedure. This welding procedure is a strong state welding method that uses a non-consumable turning device that is allowed to rub against the work piece consequently creating frictional welding. At the point when the weld requirements, for example, device or work piece turn speed, welding time, pivotal burden are ideal the contact between the work piece and the apparatus produces enough welding to make a plastic twisting layer at the weld interface. The procedure doesn't include any softening procedure and entire procedure happens in strong state through plastic disfigurement and mass stream among the work pieces. The trial examination of FSW is finished by shifting the erosion mix welding parameters, for example, work piece turn speed, welding time. The trial is finished utilizing Aluminum compound funnel of various widths, for example, Aluminum pipes with distances across 18.5 mm, 25 mm and 32 mm.

In this algorithm, soil-water interaction was simulated based on the two-phase mixture theory. Each phase of the mixture occupies part of the macroscopic mixture and satisfies its own conservation equations of mass and momentum. The Drucker-Prager model with nonassociated plastic flow rule was used to describe the constitutive behavior of soil. The water was treated as Newtonian fluid. Interaction between soil and water was modeled by the pore water pressure and the viscous drag force. The structure was considered as rigid and the interaction with soil/water was modeled by the frictional sliding contact algorithm. With this algorithm, it is possible to investigate pore water pressure, the effective stress and deformation of the soil undergoing large deformation. Moreover, the effect of the temporal and spatial evolution of soil porosity was taken into consideration. This study first examined the proposed algorithm for a U-tube seepage problem and a two-dimensional consolidation problem. Afterwards, the continuous deep penetrating process of the spudcan, which involved large soil deformation and complex soil-water-structure interaction, was simulated under axisymmetric conditions. The comparison with previous research indicates the robustness and applicability of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed approach could be a potentially efficient tool helping to reveal the mechanism of soil failure in geotechnical, costal and ocean engineering. ?? 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

The experimental results show that the incorporation of fibers can increase the compressive strength and residual strength of cement-reinforced clay as well as the corresponding axial strain when the stress peak is reached compared with cement-reinforced clay. The compressive strength of fiber-reinforced cement clay decreases first, then increases with small-composite cement at curing time 14 d and 28 d. However, fiber-reinforced cement clay?€?s strength increases with the increase of fiber content for heavy-composite cement. The compressive strength of fiber-composite cement-reinforced marine clay increases with the increase of curing time and composite cement content. The growth rate increases with the increase of curing time. The failure mode of composite cement-reinforced clay is brittle failure, while the failure mode of fiber-reinforced cemented clay is plastic failure. ?? 2020 by the authors.

JW4LUBAL,10.3390/su12072788,The drivers of sustainable apparel and sportswear consumption: A segmented kano perspective,"The steady increase of sustainable consumer behavior leads companies to strengthen their efforts to become socially and ecologically more sustainable. Particularly in the clothing and footwear industry, more and more companies are aware of their need to fundamentally adapt the way they create value. Sustainability offerings are developed, e.g., usage of upcycled materials (e.g., ocean plastic), circular business models (e.g., decomposition of returned products into components for new ones), as well as adapted product ranges (e.g., smaller or with fewer fashion cycles). However, it is frequently unclear in advance, which offerings will increase (or decrease) satisfaction and, consequently, drive (or not drive) sustainable consumption. The application of a segmented Kano perspective in an apparel and sportswear context that helps to answer these questions is presented: 17 potential offerings were assessed by a sample of 490 consumers. Our analysis demonstrates the usefulness of this methodology and that returning used products (to recycle them), discounts for buying sustainable products, sustainability level indicators, and biobased materials are highly attractive. However, the responsiveness varies across the derived consumer segments, from being decisive or attractive to indifferent or reverse. As assumed, gender and attitude towards sustainability are good predictors for segment membership. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

Based on the considerations of the mechanical properties and economic performance, the reasonable spans of various FRP cables are analyzed according to the key parametric studies by means of analytical solutions. Through applying different FRP cables at their reasonable spans, a new design for a cable-stayed bridge with a hybrid arrangement of FRP cables is proposed. The related mechanicals properties and economic performances are analyzed by a case study of a crossing sea bridge with a span of 2038 m. The analysis results indicate that the proposed bridge design of a hybrid arrangement of FRP cables can meet the static requirement of long-span cable-stayed bridges including the deflection limitation of the middle span. The seismic behavior and the wind resistance stability of the long-span cable-stayed bridge are improved by applying a cable system with a hybrid arrangement of FRP cables. In addition, according to the life cycle cost analysis, the economic performance of the cable system with a hybrid arrangement of FRP cables is better than that of the pure FRP and hybrid FRP cable systems. The cable system with a hybrid arrangement of FRP cables offers an optimum design for the long-span cable-stayed bridge with a main span of more than 2000 m. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In tsunami research, however, its applications are in their infancy and it is still rarely used. We present results for two types of organic geochemical markers, biomarkers and anthropogenic markers, present in deposits left by 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami on the Sendai Plain, Japan. As the tsunami inundated the coastal lowland up to 4.85 km inland, sediments from various sources were eroded, transported and deposited. This led to the distribution of biomarkers from different sources across the Sendai Plain creating a unique geochemical signature in the tsunami deposits. The tsunami also caused destruction along the Sendai coastline, leading to the release of large quantities of environmental pollutants (e.g., fossil fuels, tarmac, pesticides, plastics, etc.) that were distributed across the inundated area. These anthropogenic markers, represented by three main compound groups (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and halogenated compounds), were preserved in tsunami deposits (at least until 2013, prior to land clearing). Their concentrations differed significantly from the pre- and post-tsunami background contamination levels. Organic proxy concentrations can differ for sand and mud deposits due to various factors (e.g., preservation, dilution, microbial alteration). However, it can be concluded that anthropogenic markers and biomarkers have the potential to be a valuable proxy for future studies of recent tsunami deposits because of their high source specificity and relatively good preservation potential providing information about sediment sources and transport pathways (e.g., marine source, evidence of backwash). ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
WQQASUML,10.1177/1369433219886964,Mechanical performance of FRP-confined geopolymer concrete under seawater attack,"In the study, mechanical properties and durability performance of confined/unconfined geopolymer concrete and ordinary concrete specimens were investigated under ambient and seawater environments. Some of the specimens were confined by carbon fiber and basalt fiber?€?reinforced polymer fabric materials with one layer and three layers under chloride and ambient environments to observe mechanical strength contribution and durability performances of these hybrid types of materials. These fiber-reinforced polymer fabric materials were also evaluated in terms of retrofit purposes especially in the marine structures. In addition, microstructural evaluation is also conducted using scanning electron microscope on geopolymer concrete and ordinary concrete specimens to observe the amount of deterioration in microscale due to the chloride attacks. Results indicated that confined specimens exhibited enhanced strength, ductility, and durability properties than unconfined specimens, and the degree of the enhancement depended on the fiber-reinforced polymer confinement type and the number of fiber-reinforced polymer layer. Specimens confined by carbon fabrics with three layers showed superior mechanical properties and durability performance against chloride attack, while specimens confined by basalt fabrics with one layer exhibited low performance, and unconfined specimens showed the worst performance. Both fiber-reinforced polymer fabric materials can be utilized as retrofit materials in structural elements against chloride attacks. The results also pointed out that seawater attack reduced the ductility performance of the geopolymer concrete and ordinary concrete specimens. Furthermore, geopolymer concrete specimens were found more durable than the ordinary concrete specimens, and both types of concretes exhibited similar fracture properties, indicating that geopolymer concrete can be utilized for structural elements instead of ordinary concretes. ??

TPW458XH,10.1111/jfpp.14379,Shelf life prolongation of cherry tomato using magnesium hydroxide reinforced bio-nanocomposite and conventional plastic films,"This investigation elaborates the effect of storage conditions and packaging materials on the shelf life of cherry tomato stored under passive modified atmosphere packaging (PMAP) in heat-sealed pouches. The fruits were encased with 25 ??m thick continuous oriented pectin-based bionanocomposite (PBNC), polypropylene, and low density poly ethylene packages and tested at 30 ?? 2 ??C relative humidity (RH = 61.2 ?? 3%) and 10 ?? 0.5 ??C (RH = 90 ?? 2%) storage conditions, while the fruits kept without packaging were taken as control. Advancement of storage in PBNC packages indicated significant decrement (p &lt;.05) in the O2 concentration, firmness, and titratable acidity and significant increment (p &lt;.05) in CO2 concentration, physiological loss in weight, total soluble solids, chroma, and total color difference. The lycopene concentration varied erratically as the senescence progressed. The type of packaging material used had no significant effect on the physiological, physico-chemical, and biochemical properties of cherry tomato. PMAP coupled with low temperature (10 ??C) prolonged the shelf life of cherry tomatoes till 24 days of storage. Practical applications: The degradation of environment by the use of synthetic polymer based packaging materials has become a burgeoning problem. The need of biodegradable packaging materials with good mechanical and barrier properties is vital for checking sea and land pollution. The pectin-based bionanocomposite film reinforced with magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles developed in this research will be helpful for the food packaging industry for sustainable packaging of fresh produce. Based on the experimental results, reinforcing of pectin film with magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles improved its physical, thermal, and barrier properties and helped in retention of bioactive compounds during storage of cherry tomato under modified atmosphere storage. These films competed well with low density polyethylene and polypropylene, which are largely used for packaging of fresh produce. ?? 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

To date, 792 collections of various cultivated organisms from 76 countries are registered in the catalog of the World Federation for Culture Collections in the WDCM CCINFO database. This is the most extensive consolidated database of culture collections, which includes both well-known large collections and small repositories of research and educational institutions from all over the world. The database contains 47 algological collections and 80 collections of various microorganisms, which also include microalgae and cyanobacteria cultures. Only 30 biological collections are registered in Russia, from which only 13 contain algae strains. The most common technique of microalgae cultures storage is the method of their periodic re-sowing onto liquid media or agar. It is used in 127 collections (99 % of the total number in the catalog). Other methods used are: cryopreservation - in 33 collections (27 %), lyophilization - in 13 (11 %), L-drying - in 5 (4 %), freezing - in 19 (16 %), and immobilization in alginate beads - in 1 (0.8 %). However, when using these methods, there is a change in morphological and functional features of cells of the cultures stored, as well as their shredding. In addition, cultures maintaining in a viable state is time-consuming and requires expensive equipment. Preservation of microalgae, transferred to the state of anhydrobiosis by dehydration, is simple and cost-effective. Anhydrobiosis is a deep and long-term inhibition of metabolism, reversible under favorable conditions; it is a quite common phenomenon in nature. The only collection in the WDCM CCINFO database that applies the method of transferring cells to a resting state (for soil algae) is the collection of algae cultures of the National University of Kyiv (ACKU WDCM 994). Many years of experiments on the transfer of microalgae to the state of anhydrobiosis allowed us to develop a method of long-term preservation of microalgae without the use of nutrient media. This technique includes cells transfer to the state of anhydrobiosis, their preservation in a dehydrated state, and subsequent removal to an active culture. In order to preserve algological biodiversity, IBSS RAS created a repository of microalgae transferred to the state of anhydrobiosis, which can be converted to active cultures if necessary. The objects of the repository were marine unicellular algae, as well as freshwater and halobic species of lower phototrophs which are perspective for biotechnology and aquaculture. The cultures were obtained as an inoculum from IBSS RAS collection of live cultures of planktonic microalgae. The algae were grown in an accumulative mode under constant lighting. The biomass was collected during cultivation of algologically pure microalgae cultures at the growth retardation or at the stationary stage. Cells were separated from the culture medium by centrifugation or by filtering them on a plankton sieve. Then the algae were dehydrated and maintained in hermetic zipper bags placed in plastic containers of 100 to 500 ml, at a temperature of +18?€?+21 ??C in the dark in a specially equipped room. The main part of the collection is represented by strains from the phyla Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Rodophyta. The list of species, the number of isolates stored, and the information on preservation forms are provided in this article. The technological regulations for maintenance and replenishment of the storage of anhydrobiotic cultures are described. The repository is at the stage of formation. Its future lies in the fund expansion to include marine, freshwater, and halobic species. Optimization of the dehydration method will allow the transfer of microalgae belonging to different systematic phyla to the state of anhydrobiosis. ?? 2020 Kovalevsky Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas of RAS.

SITEXTIB,10.1021/acssensors.9b01882,SERS-Based Molecularly Imprinted Plasmonic Sensor for Highly Sensitive PAH Detection,"A novel hybrid plasmonic platform based on the synergetic combination of a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) thin film with Au nanoparticle (NPs) assemblies, noted as Au@MIP, was developed for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy recognition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). While the MIP trapped the PAH close to the Au surface, the plasmonic NPs enhanced the molecule's Raman signal. The Au@MIP fabrication comprises a two-step procedure, first, the layer-by-layer deposition of Au NPs on glass and their further coating with a uniform MIP thin film. Profilometry analysis demonstrated that the thickness and homogeneity of the MIP film could be finely tailored by tuning different parameters such as prepolymerization time or spin-coating rate. Two different PAH molecules, pyrene or fluoranthene, were used as templates for the fabrication of pyrene- or fluoranthene-based Au@MIP substrates. The use of pyrene or fluoranthene, as the template molecule to fabricate the Au@MIP thin films, enabled its ultradetection in the nM regime with a 100-fold improvement compared with the nonimprinted plasmonic sensors (Au@NIPs). The SERS data analysis allowed to estimate the binding constant of the template molecule to the MIP. The selectivity of both pyrene- and fluoranthene-based Au@MIPs was analyzed against three PAHs of different sizes. The results displayed the important role of the template molecule used for the Au@MIPs fabrication in the selectivity of the system. Finally, the practical applicability of pyrene-based Au@MIPs was shown by performing the detection of pyrene in two real samples: creek water and seawater. The design and optimization of this type of plasmonic platform will pave the way for the detection of other relevant (bio)molecules in a broad range of fields such as environmental control, food safety, or biomedicine. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

In addition, the fatigue problem of key components due to long-term marine alternating loads can not be ignored. The method is developed independently on processing samples of cage for testing its performance parameters, among which the fatigue Wohler curve is S = -1.022ln (N) + 22.201. By adapting the following methods: Mechanical test, Equivalent load finite element simulation and Full field finite element simulation respectively is verified each other, and the error is less than 5%. The key nodes of the stress concentration of the floating frame are mainly the welding point, the mooring point and the edge area of the I-beam frame at both sides. The damage of the cage which caused by tensile and bending loads should be considered at the same time. And the tensile strength 22.12 MPa and the bending strength 30.58 MPa could be taken as the evaluation standard for the elastic to plastic deformation. Structural fracture occurs when the elongation at break exceeds 340.18%. The fatigue of the cage is mainly because the stress is much greater than the fatigue limit 3.38 MPa. The material model test combined with structural mechanics simulation provides the basis for guiding the structural optimization design of the cage. ?? 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, there is a lack of information from a few meters from the coastline even though monitoring the nearshore is absolutely needed to fully understand the paths and magnitude of microplastic pollution, including its implications for coastal management and water quality. Traditional scientific data acquisition using conventional platforms such as research vessels or small boats is expensive and hampered by numerous limitations in the nearshore zone, ranging from too shallow (and risky) depths to the presence of swimmers. Here, we provide the scientific community with an affordable and easy to use manta trawl called paddle trawl to be attached to a paddle surf board to acquire scientific samples in the nearshore within the frame of a citizen science monitoring project with the Spanish delegation of the non-governmental organization Surfrider Foundation Europe. Our results show, as a proof of concept, that a lightweight and low-cost paddle trawl towed behind paddle surfers allows obtaining samples for microplastic characterization and quantification while raising awareness of pollution by the allochtonous particles. An average of 11.7 ?? 104 items km??? 2 was found in the nearshore, similar to those found offshore in the Mediterranean Sea. However, a comparison with offshore data obtained with a standard manta trawl shows differences in plastic size distributions. Whereas microplastics dominated in offshore waters mesoplastics and macroplastics prevailed in the nearshore. A larger variety of polymers, including high-density ones and higher average lengths nearshore shows that this area is likely to produce and export microplastics towards offshore waters. ?? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

In the environment, there are two-way interactions between the MP properties and biofilm communities: (i) microorganisms may prefer some surfaces, and (ii) MP surface properties change during the colonization and weathering. In a 2-week experiment, we studied these interactions using three model plastic beads (polyethylene [PE], polypropylene [PP], and polystyrene [PS]) exposed to ambient bacterioplankton assemblage from the Baltic Sea; the control beads were exposed to bacteria-free water. For each polymer, the physicochemical properties (compression, crystallinity, surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, and surface topography) were compared before and after exposure under controlled laboratory conditions. Furthermore, we characterized the bacterial communities on the MP surfaces using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and correlated community diversity to the physicochemical properties of the MP. Significant changes in PE crystallinity, PP stiffness, and PS maximum compression were observed as a result of exposure to bacteria. Moreover, there were significant correlations between bacterial diversity and some physicochemical characteristics (crystallinity, stiffness, and surface roughness). These changes coincided with variation in the relative abundance of unique OTUs, mostly related to the PE samples having significantly higher contribution of Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, and uncultured Planctomycetaceae compared to the other test materials, whereas PP and PS samples had significantly higher abundance of Sphingobacteriales and Alphaproteobacteria, indicating possible involvement of these taxa in the initial biodegradation steps. Our findings demonstrate measurable signs of MP weathering under short-term exposure to environmentally relevant microbial communities at conditions resembling those in the water column. A systematic approach for the characterization of the biodegrading capacity in different systems will improve the risk assessment of plastic litter in aquatic environments. ??

The reliable methods and instruments for fast analysis of microplastics (MPs) less than 5 mm are urgently needed. In this study, a new method based on custom-made portable pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (Pyr-MS) is developed, which enables rapid identification and mass related quantification of MPs. MPs are decomposed in the compact pyrolyzer and then directly analyzed in the portable MS by the chemical fingerprints of polymers including characteristic ions and their special ratio. It avoids the complex extraction and separation procedures of the pyrolysis/thermogravimetric-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Pyr/TGA-GC-MS), realizes the rapid analysis of MPs in 5 min, and thus can practically apply to a large number of MPs samples. In comparison to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Raman, this method is not limited by the shape, size, and color of MPs. Four common plastics including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were investigated to verify the feasibility of this method. The environmental MPs samples collected from a beach were successfully identified and quantified, demonstrating the simplicity and practicality of this approach. The influence of plastics aging on the chemical fingerprints and the potential of mixed plastics detection by Pyr-MS are also assessed. The portable Pyr-MS could provide a promising tool for in-field analysis of MPs such as ship-based marine MPs surveys. Copyright ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",
QQGYEY9D,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b06491,A Sustainable Blue Energy Scavenging Smart Buoy toward Self-Powered Smart Fishing Net Tracker,"Water is abundantly present on Earth. Water waves have the unique feature of being random and irregular. The impact of water waves can be utilized to derive power by employing a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). Fishing is one of the main occupations in our society, and fishermen risk their lives every day for their occupation. During fishing, they face many obstacles such as heavy wind, fog, and tides, and these scenarios force them to lose their fishing nets in the sea. The loss of fishing nets not only leads to financial damage to the poor fishermen but also adds plastic pollution to the water bodies. A low cost, user-friendly approach to finding their fishing nets is highly desirable. Here, a self-powered smart fishing net-tracking buoy is developed for identifying fishing nets via integration of a Smart Buoy-Triboelectric Nanogenerator (SB-TENG), a power management unit, Arduino, and a Bluetooth controller using a smartphone. By scavenging blue energy, the SB-TENG device generates an open-circuit voltage of 900 V, and a short-circuit current of 11 ??A and integration of multiple units of SB-TENG further enhances the performance. The SB-TENG was studied and demonstrated as a feasible power source that can commute instantaneous remote switching operation of LEDs. Moreover, by combining SB-TENG with Arduino and the Bluetooth controller, it acts as a self-powered wireless control system.

PCBZY5GU,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135432,Accumulation of microplastics in typical commercial aquatic species: A case study at a productive aquaculture site in China,"The widespread occurrence of microplastics in the marine environment has drawn global attention because microplastics may impact the populations of marine organisms. As such, aquaculture industry may suffer from microplastic pollution, especially when plastic products are widely used for aquaculture. Here, we assessed the abundance and characteristics (type, size and composition) of microplastics in sediment and typical commercial species (fish, bivalves and shrimps) in an aquaculture site at Xiangshan Bay, which has been operated intensively for decades. Satellite remote sensing images revealed that aquaculture activities were associated with microplastic pollution in sediment, where the microplastics (51?€?88 items/kg dry weight) were mostly fibres (>94%) and between 500 and 2000 ??m. Cellulose was the predominant polymer (60?€?88% of microplastic composition), followed by polypropylene. Microplastics accumulated in all the commercial species (0.95?€?2.1 items per individual), where shrimp (Parapenaeopsis hardwickii) had lower potential for microplastic accumulation than the other species. The predominance of fibres and cellulose in the commercial species implies their limited ability to recognize the type and composition of microplastics during ingestion. Given the limited accumulation of microplastics in these typical commercial species even at a productive aquaculture site, we suggest that microplastics may not increase the health risk of consuming seafood and their impacts on commercial species may be less deleterious than previously thought. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",
VHX4Y7MF,10.1016/j.watres.2019.115400,A close relationship between microplastic contamination and coastal area use pattern,"Human activity is thought to affect the abundance and contamination characteristics of microplastics (MPs) in the environment, which may in turn affect aquatic species. However, few studies have examined the impact of coastal area use pattern on characteristics of MPs in coastal regions. In this study, we investigated MP contamination of abiotic matrices (seawater and sediment) and biotic matrices (bivalves and polychaetes) in three coastal regions characterized by different types of human activity, covering urban, aquafarm, and rural areas. MP abundance was higher in sediment from the urban site than in that from the rural site, but similar to that from the aquafarm site. In the abiotic matrices, different MP polymer compositions were observed among the three sites. Diverse polymers were found in marine matrices from the urban site, implying diverse MP sources in highly populated and industrialized areas. Polystyrene was more abundant in the aquafarm site, reflecting the wide use of expanded polystyrene aquaculture buoys. Polypropylene was more abundant at the rural site, probably due to the use of polypropylene ropes and nets in fishing activity. MP accumulation profiles in marine invertebrates showed trends similar to those exhibited by abiotic matrices, reflecting coastal area use patterns. These results indicate that marine MPs are generated from both land- and marine-based sources, and that the abiotic and biotic marine matrices reflect the MP characteristics. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
AADRLHBL,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134876,Colonization characteristics of bacterial communities on microplastics compared with ambient environments (water and sediment) in Haihe Estuary,"The bacterial communities on microplastics in marine and freshwater environments have been described by many studies. However, the migration and transportation processes of bacterial communities on microplastics in estuarine areas remain unclear. In this study, the bacterial communities on three substrates (microplastics, surface water and sediment) in estuarine areas (the Haihe Estuary (HHE) in Bohai Bay, China) were investigated based on 16S rRNA sequencing. The mean OTUs of the three substrates ?€? water, microplastics and sediments ?€? were 1091, 2213 and 3419, respectively. The partitioning of the OTUs among the three substrates indicated that the microplastics could be messengers facilitating the bacterial transportation between water and sediment. According to nMDS and relative abundance analyses, it was found that the microplastics enriched the particular bacteria (e.g., Halobacteriaceae and Pseudoalteromonadaceae) and weakened the influence of environmental variation. In addition, taxonomic and metabolic-pathway analyses indicated that the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas and Bacillus) on microplastics was significantly higher than that in the ambient environment. Meanwhile, the microplastic polymer types had little effect on the abundance and structure of the bacterial communities. Compared with surface water and sediments, microplastics could be a good habitat for bacterial communities and could lead to potential ecological risks because of the high stability, pathogenicity and stress tolerance of the bacterial communities on microplastics. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

Here, we quantify the presence of MPs in fish collected from Zhanjiang mangrove wetland, the largest mangrove in South China, which provide baseline data on MPs accumulation in fish in mangrove environment as the first evidence in China. MPs were found in 30 out of 32 fish species at an average abundance of 2.83 ?? 1.84 items individual???1, ranged from 0.6 to 8.0 items individual???1 in each species. MPs were detected in gills, stomach and intestine, and not found in muscles and livers. Positive relationship was found between MPs abundance and body length or weight of mangrove fish. The dominant polymers identified by micro-FTIR were polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene and cellophane. MPs consisted primarily of fibers and with the prominent size range of 0.02?€?1 mm. The body sizes, living habitats and feeding habits of fish are important factors affecting MPs accumulation in different fish species.

This fact may be associated with the lack of cell lines from this species, excellent models for the comprehension of fish physiology, immunology, toxicology and virology, that contribute to the reduction in the number of animals used in research. We have generated, for the first time, a brain-derived cell line from mummichog, FuB-1, and evaluated its application to the fields of fish virology, immunity and toxicology. First, FuB-1 cells show epithelial morphology and neural stem/astroglial origin. Secondly, FuB-1 cells effectively supports the replication of both spring viremia carp (SVCV) and infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPNV) viruses, but not nodavirus (NNV), indicating its potential use for fish virology. Related to this, FuB-1 cells infected with NNV up-regulate the transcription of genes related to the antiviral immune response, leading to cell resistance; while they are unaltered when infected with IPNV and SVCV, facilitating viral replication. Finally, FuB-1 cells were used for toxicological purposes and we demonstrated that exposure to either polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-100) or several human-usage pharmaceuticals are cytotoxic. Additionally, PS-100 particles increase the antioxidant catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities and decrease the total non-protein thiols in FuB-1 cells. However, PS-100 particles are able to reduce the cytotoxic effects induced by the pharmaceuticals. In conclusion, we have generated a cell line from mummichog, which might represent a valuable model for fish studies in the fields of virology, immunology and toxicology. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",
SXSSQGEW,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134594,"Selectively enrichment of antibiotics and ARGs by microplastics in river, estuary and marine waters","The partition of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) between the microplastics (MPs) and the surrounding water with various salinity are still unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that adsorption of antibiotics on MPs might cause a significant change of the structure of microbial communities, diversity and abundance of ARGs on MPs and this might be further affected by change of salinity. In this study, we investigated adsorption of four common antibiotics (sulfamerazine, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and tylosin) to polyethylene (PE) MPs in river, estuary and marine waters, and the differences of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and bacterial communities on MPs and in the three waters. The results showed that MPs can enrich antibiotics, ARGs and microbes from the surrounding water. Elevated salinity could reduce adsorption of antibiotics to MPs and the abundance of ARGs. For example, MPs can concentrate more antibiotics and ARGs in the fresh river water than in the estuary and the marine waters. In addition, ARGs and bacterial communities on MPs at various salinity were significantly different under the pressure of four antibiotics. On MPs, sul1, sulA/folP-01, tetA, tetC, tetX and ermE increased significantly but a few new ARGs such as sulA/folP-01 and tetA appeared. The structure of the bacterial communities on MPs was different from the surrounding water since some bacteria species found on MPs were barely detected in the surrounding water while some genera on MPs vanished after exposure to antibiotics. As the antibiotics adsorbed and the ARGs on MPs decreased with the water salinity, the structure of the communities on MPs thus varied with salinity change. These findings are important to understand the effects of MPs on the transport, fate and ecological risk of antibiotics and ARGs in different aquatic environments. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",
NBC9FVWV,10.1016/j.watres.2019.115401,Aggregation and stability of nanoscale plastics in aquatic environment,"The widespread use and release of plastics in nature have raised global concerns about their impact on public health and the environment. While much research has been conducted on macro- and micro-sized plastics, the fate of nanoscale plastics remains unexplored. In this study, the aggregation kinetics and stability of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics were investigated over a wide range of aquatic chemistries (pH, salt types (NaCl, CaCl2, MgCl2), ionic strength) relevant to the natural environment. Results showed that salt types and ionic strength had significant effects on the stability of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics, while pH had none. Aggregation and stability of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics in the aquatic environment followed colloidal theory (DLVO theory and Schulze-Hardy rule), similar to other colloidal particles. The critical coagulation concentration (CCC) values of polyethylene nanoscale plastics were lower for CaCl2 (0.1 mM) compared to NaCl (80 mM) and MgCl2 (3 mM). Similarly, CCC values of polystyrene nanospheres were 10 mM for CaCl2, 800 mM for NaCl and 25 mM for MgCl2. It implies that CaCl2 destabilized both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics more aggressively than NaCl and MgCl2. Moreover, polystyrene nanospheres are more stable in the aquatic environment than polyethylene nanoscale plastics. However, natural organic matter improved the stability of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in water primarily due to steric repulsion, increasing CCC values to 0.4 mM, 120 mM and 8 mM for CaCl2, NaCl and MgCl2 respectively. Stability studies with various water conditions demonstrated that polyethylene nanoscale plastics will be fairly stable in the natural surface waters. Conversely, synthetic surface water, wastewater, seawater and groundwater rapidly destabilized polyethylene nanoscale plastics. Overall, our findings indicate that significant aqueous transport of nanoscale plastics will be possible in natural surface waters. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

In composite parts assembly, delamination is being a critical issue during drilling operation due to its anisotropy property. The present work aims to study the effect of delamination during drilling on Sisal-Glass Fibres Reinforced Polymer (S-GFRP) material. The experiments were planned with Taguchi's approach to determine the delamination. The damaged zone around the drilled holes was measured using a profile projector and subsequently analyzed through ImageJ software. Signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio was used to analyze and optimize the working parameters for minimum delamination. The delamination determined by the two different approaches, namely profile projector and image processing has consistent results and has good agreement with each other. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

A theoretical analysis is performed for predicting the Poisson's ratios of perforated auxetic structures, and validated experimentally. A comparison between conventional and auxetic perforated structures under compression shows that the SCF/NP specimens have higher stiffness than the NP structures and the auxetic structure can reach a NPR of about ???1. The effects of perforation geometry and material type on the mechanical properties are investigated. Results depict a decrease in nominal stress with an increase in the perforation gap, but the perforation gap increase leads to enhancement of relative density, effective strain and average Poisson's ratio. Further, SCF/NP structures have advantages over NP structures due to their higher effective strain, effective specific energy absorption (SEA) and relative Young's modulus. Subsequently, an improved auxetic structure is designed, and a comparative study between the designed structure and two common auxetic structures (with the same relative density of 0.32) shows that the designed auxetic structures have the highest SEA and relative Young's modulus with the strongest auxetic effect (smallest average Poisson's ratio). ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In this study, welding deformation due to three outside corner joints (with angles of 60, 70 and 140??) used in an aluminum catamaran hull is evaluated by considering the length and welding speed parameters. The deformation is predicted via two numerical procedures based on finite element computations. Thermal-Elastic-Plastic (TEP) analysis is applied on local 3D solid models for each of the three outside corner joints to calculate inherent strain for global shell model of an aluminum catamaran to obtain deformation elastically based on inherent deformation theory. Validations of numerical results were performed by using metallographic observations and welding distortion. For more accuracy the softening effect was investigated by Vickers Microhardness test. The results from both TEP and FE elastic analyses indicate reasonably good agreement with experimental results. Besides, in the global shell model of the catamaran, out-of-plane welding deformation will occur significantly near the maximum angle of outside corner joint (140-degree) where the maximum welding distortion is obtained. Along with the welding speed parameter has considerable influence on decreasing distortion which results in reducing time-consuming and cost in the catamaran production stage. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Although polyethylene glycol (PEG) and zwitterionic polymers have been widely used as anti-fouling materials, there still remain critical challenges for their use as protein-corona agents for drug delivery and targeting. Here, we have designed novel amphoteric natural starch-stabilized core-shell colloidal nanoparticles with more efficient protein corona-free properties, under long term circulation, at different protein concentrations and in different protein charge environments, compared to typical anti-fouling materials such as PEG and zwitterionic polymers. More importantly, the starch-coated polymer nanoparticles can be further functionalized by antibodies to achieve additional excellent targeting and cell internalization capabilities for their use in photodynamic therapy.

Multiple studies have been addressing the effects of microplastics in various organisms but, despite the increased scientific awareness, there is still a significant gap in knowledge when it comes to small-sized plastic particles of sizes below 100 nm. The aim of this study was to understand the effect of waterborne 100 nm polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs) on the marine polychaeta Hediste diversicolor, a keystone species in intertidal and coastal environments, in terms of behavior, neurotransmission, oxidative status, energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Results of PS NPs characterization showed an aggregation along the time and with increasing concentrations. Results also revealed a considerable impact of PS NPs on ecologically relevant endpoints like cholinesterase (ChE) and burrowing, but no increases in most of the parameters associated with oxidative stress. Protein carbonylation was found to be more sensitive to PS NPs effects than lipid peroxidation. Behavioral alterations induced by PS NPs may affect nutrient cycling and (endo-)benthic fauna. The data revealed in this study highlighted the potential consequences of NPs to benthic organisms and the need for further studies. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

Mangrove sediments containing vegetal litter are different from other environmental matrices such as river and marine sediments. The presence of vegetal litter leads to an under-estimation of microplastic pollution, particularly classical digestion methods are not suitable for removing this type of organic matter. The present study aims to develop a digestion method to remove vegetal litter and improve the determination of microplastic pollution in mangrove sediments. Results showed that our three-stage method with repeatedly addition of hydrogen peroxide had the highest efficiency in removing mangrove vegetal litter when compared with the three classical digestion methods. The high match scores of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy proved that the developed method had little impacts on the integrity of five polymer types of microplastics. The developed method also achieved high efficiency in extracting microplastics from mangrove sediments containing different content of vegetal litter.

From the Swiss catchment towards the North Sea,"Rivers are pivotal carriers of microplastic (MP) towards the oceans. Investigative data on MP pollution in rivers at specific timepoints is continuously compiled. However, such snapshot data can only roughly indicate the long-term extent of contamination and particle fluxes; modelling studies informed by this limited data are prone to large uncertainties. The present study sought to narrow this knowledge gap by examining the differences in MP concentrations, loads and compositions at three nival tributaries and the Rhine River in Basel, Switzerland, as well as two downstream pluvial Lower Rhine River locations in Germany over four seasons throughout 2016?€?2017. MP concentrations (>0.3 mm) correlated positively with average water discharge and catchment size of the evaluated stream locations and MP concentrations were significantly higher at the downstream pluvial than upstream nival sites. There was no coherent pattern in MP concentration fluctuations between seasons across the six sites investigated, and no correlation with recent precipitation. These findings suggest that temporal variations in MP fluxes towards the North Sea through the year are dominated by the different discharge regimes along the river course. This study also corroborates theoretical models that predict the highest MP loads move downstream the Rhine River during the European winter months. ?? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

In the present study, stranded foams were collected from an island located in South China Sea, to investigate the levels and profiles of several flame retardants (FRs) and plasticizers, including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organophosphate esters (OPEs), emerging brominated FRs, and dechlorane plus (DP). The concentrations of PBDEs and OPEs in plastic debris ranged from not detected (ND, <0.60 ng/g) to 0.46 mg/g and from ND (<0.70 ng/g) to 17.3 mg/g, respectively. The high levels of PBDEs and OPEs were expected as the fact that PBDEs and OPEs were incorporated additives in plastics. OPEs were the main chemicals in most of foams. Brominated FRs dominated in some samples. Core and surface parts in foams had similar composition profiles of pollutants. Significantly higher concentrations of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) were observed in surface samples than core samples (p < .05). TCEP and TPHP in foam surface seem to be from both incorporated additives and adsorbed chemicals from environmental matrices. The density of pollutants introduced by stranded foams in sampling area was estimated in comparison with air deposition of pollutants. The high loading of pollutants in stranded foams indicates that foams can be potential sources for organic pollutants, especially incorporated plastic additives, in islands. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

In this present work, glass fiber/epoxy (GE) composites have been fabricated with and without carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and aging has been carried out in acidic (pH = 1), seawater (pH = 8.2), and alkaline (pH = 13) solutions for 150 days. The resistance of CNF-filled GE composites toward the corrosive fluids has been evaluated in terms of alteration in the mechanical (flexural), microstructural (fractography analysis by field emission scanning electron microscope), and thermomechanical (dynamic mechanical analysis) behavior of the materials. It is revealed that as the immersion time increases, there is a continuous decrement in flexural strength and modulus, and glass-transition temperature (Tg) of all the materials in all these solutions. Compared to the 1% CNF-filled GE composite, control GE composite showed more degradation in the case of alkaline aging and seawater aging. Maximum reduction (56%) in the strength of GE composite was observed due to 150 days of alkaline aging.

The amount of plastics accumulating in the environment is growing rapidly, yet our understanding of its persistence is very limited. This Perspective summarizes the existing literature on environmental degradation rates and pathways for the major types of thermoplastic polymers. A metric to harmonize disparate types of measurements, the specific surface degradation rate (SSDR), is implemented and used to extrapolate half-lives. SSDR values cover a very wide range, with some of the variability arising due to degradation studies conducted in different natural environments. SSDRs for high density polyethylene (HDPE) in the marine environment range from practically 0 to approximately 11 ??m year-1. This approach yields a number of interesting insights. Using a mean SSDR for HDPE in the marine environment, linear extrapolation leads to estimated half-lives ranging from 58 years (bottles) to 1200 years (pipes). For example, SSDRs for HDPE and polylactic acid (PLA) are surprisingly similar in the marine environment, although PLA degrades approximately 20 times faster than HDPE on land.

Among renewable biomass, marine algae are gaining importance as third generation biomass feedstocks owing to their advantages over lignocellulose. Particularly, red macroalgae have higher carbohydrate contents and simpler carbohydrate compositions than other marine algae. In red macroalgal carbohydrates, 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose (AHG) is the main sugar composing agarose along with d-galactose. However, AHG is not a common sugar and is chemically unstable. Thus, not only AHG but also red macroalgal biomass itself cannot be efficiently converted or utilized. Here, we biologically upgraded AHG to a new platform chemical, its sugar alcohol form, 3,6-anhydro-l-galactitol (AHGol), an anhydrohexitol. To accomplish this, we devised an integrated process encompassing a chemical hydrolysis process for producing agarobiose (AB) from agarose and a biological process for converting AB to AHGol using metabolically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to efficiently produce AHGol from agarose with high titers and yields. AHGol was also converted to an intermediate chemical for plastics, isosorbide.

Particularly, microplastics below 1 mm in length, are missing in surface waters due to removal processes like ingestion by marine animals, biofouling, and sinking. Here, we studied how a species of mushroom corals (Danafungia scruposa), common in the Maldives, contributed to the removal of microplastics from the water suspension through active (ingestion) and passive (adhesion to the surface) mechanisms. We evaluated if removal rates were affected by the presence of the coral natural prey (i.e., Artemia salina) and by biofouling on the surface of the microplastic. We found that the coral quickly interacts both actively and passively with microplastics and that the probability for the coral to ingest and retain microplastics was higher when the surface of the microplastic was biofouled. We also found that passive adhesion of microplastics was the primary mechanism through which corals sequester microplastics from the water column. ??

However, the effects of environmental concentrations of MPs, singly or in combination with organic pollutants, on the early development of marine fish remain unclear. In this study, fertilized eggs of marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) were exposed to polystyrene MPs (0, 2, 20, 200 ??g/L) and/or phenanthrene (Phe, 50 ??g/L) for 28 days. The results revealed that MPs were accumulated on the chorion and ingested by larvae from 2 days post-hatching. High levels of MPs (20 and 200 ??g/L) decreased the hatchability, delayed the hatching time, and suppressed the growth, whereas Phe inhibited hatching and caused malformations in larvae. The presence of MPs at 20 and 200 ??g/L did not alter the toxicity of Phe. By contrast, combined exposure to 2 ??g/L MPs and Phe increased the hatchability by 25.8%, decreased malformation and mortality rates, and restored Phe-induced abnormal expressions of cardiac development-related genes. The reduced early developmental toxicity could be attributed to the decreased bioavailability and bioaccumulation of Phe by the low level of MPs. These findings contradicted the view that MPs would aggravate the toxicity of organic pollutants, and future studies are warranted to elucidate the ecological risks of marine MPs. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

Poly(ethylene terephthalate) microfibers (PMFs) are among the main primary microplastics (as-produced polymer microparticles).

PMFs are potentially hazardous pollutants for ecosystems and human health, being a deceiving food source for animal organisms at the base of the food chain (e.g. sediment and water filtrators, including edible shellfish and small crustaceans). This study describes a simple, sensitive and versatile procedure for quantifying the total mass of PET micro- and nano-particles in sediments. The procedure involves aqueous alkaline PET depolymerization with phase transfer catalysis, oxidation and fractionations to remove interfering species and pre-concentrate the terephthalic acid (TPA) monomer, and TPA quantification by reversed-phase HPLC. Recovery of TPA from a model sediment spiked with 800 ppm PET micropowder was 98.2 %, with limits of detection/quantification LOD = 17.2 ??g/kg and LOQ = 57.0 ??g/kg. Analyses of sandy sediments from a marine beach in Tuscany, Italy, showed contamination in the 370?€?460 ??g/kg range, suggesting that a not negligible fraction of PET microfibers released in surface waters ends up in shore sediments. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

But for inspecting hydraulic structures (for example, piles of berths), it is necessary to measure the strength of concrete under water. For this purpose, it is possible to use the method of plastic deformation using a shotgun as a percussion device for spearfishing while providing a constant (controlled) force of impact. The works described in the article on obtaining special calibration dependences allowed to successfully apply the method of plastic deformation for measuring the strength of concrete in the inspection of piles of berths in the Black, Barents and Okhotsk seas. ??

In this context, the influence of reinforcement architecture on the static mechanical performance of composite leaf spring was investigated. Reinforcement in the form of E-Glass chopped fibers, uni-directional (UD), bi-directional (2D) woven, and 3D orthogonal woven preforms were used to prepare composite leaf spring with identical fiber volume fraction and composite processing conditions. Composite leaf springs were analyzed for tensile properties, load-deflection behavior, strain rate sensitivity, hysteresis behavior (Damping), and relaxation behavior. Performance of 3D woven-based composite leaf spring was significantly better than chopped, UD, and 2D counterparts in terms of energy absorption, strain rate sensitivity, hysteresis damping (energy dissipation), and relaxation behavior. Overall 3D composite leaf spring shows a high potential for leaf spring application. ?? 2019, ?? 2019 Japan Society for Composite Materials, Korean Society for Composite Materials and Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

Tensile strength, elongation-at-break and heat deflection temperature (HDT) of the composites decreased upon the addition of CFS, however, Young?€?s modulus improved, significantly. The flexural strength, density, and hardness of the composites increased by 5%, 1%, and 11%, respectively, with increasing the CFS content. The impact strength and the melt flow index (MFI) noticeably increased with increasing CFS loading. These results signified the fact that the CFS/PP composites from CFS biowaste showed improved mechanical properties and it can be a potential alternative biomaterial for various biomedical applications. In addition, the application of CFS as a filler in polymers can be viewed as a sustainable approach that incorporates biowaste-based value-added material and can simultaneously mitigate the sewage problems in a smart manner in the marine environment. ?? 2019, ?? 2019 Japan Society for Composite Materials, Korean Society for Composite Materials and Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

We present a baseline estimate of the abundance of floating plastics around the Southern Ocean from a survey of floating macro-, meso- and microplastic pollution conducted during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition in 2016/17. A total of 40 net trawls and 626 h of observation were performed during this survey. Of these, 33 net samples and 552 h of observation were made in polar waters south of the Subtropical Front (STF). Only 5 microplastics and 17 macrolitter items were observed south of the STF, confirming the Southern Ocean as the region with the lowest concentrations of plastic pollution globally. The mean concentrations of floating macrolitter (0.02?€?0.03 items??km???2) and small plastic fragments (188 ?? 589 particles??km???2) south of the STF were one order of magnitude lower than in adjacent temperate waters north of the STF, which suggests that the STF acts as a barrier to the southward transport of floating debris. Despite their much lower density, the mass of macroplastics was similar to that of floating microplastics in the Southern Ocean. ?? 2020 The Authors",

Public understandings of plastic pollution,"This paper explores people's knowledge and understandings of microplastics; the role of media in framing perceptions and socio-cultural dimensions to popular solutions to reduce single-use plastics. We conducted 6 focus groups (2016?€?17) involving participants with no obvious knowledge of microplastics and some with special interest. Most people were unaware of microplastics though environmentally conscious participants had heard of microbeads due to media reporting concerning regulation. Few made connections between their personal use of plastics and ocean pollution. Plastic pollution was associated with macro-plastic ?€?islands?€? in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and powerful media images of charismatic wildlife entanglement remote from participants lives. The scale of microplastics (not easily detected), poor understanding of the science behind microplastics and cultural ideas about healthy and appropriate behaviour presents barriers to change. Science communicators, NGOs, industry and policy makers must take account of media representations and the culturally embedded nature of plastics in society. ?? 2018",

In order to improve the real-time monitoring ability of marine ecosystem micro-plastic pollution, a real-time monitoring method of marine ecosystem micro-plastic pollution is proposed, which is based on the fusion of marine ecosystem micro-plastic pollution data and fuzzy correlation detection of pollutants. Firstly, a data acquisition system for real-time monitoring of micro-plastic pollution in marine ecosystem is designed. On the basis of data collection, big data's statistical analysis model of micro-plastic pollution in marine ecosystem is constructed. The data fusion of marine ecosystem micro-plastic pollution is carried out by the method of block detection and gray-scale quantitative statistical analysis, and the cluster analysis and detection of marine ecosystem micro-plastic pollution monitoring data are carried out with the method of correlation feature extraction. Achieve real-time monitoring of micro-plastic pollution in marine ecosystem.

Accumulation of microplastics and associated contaminants in marine fish, may pose adverse impacts to human health via seafood consumption. This study evaluated microplastic contamination in 24 fish species collected from Beibu Gulf, one of the world's largest fishing grounds in South China Sea. Microplastics were detected in 12 fish species at an abundance of 0.027?€?1.000 items individual???1 and found in fish stomach, intestines and gills with the count percentage of 57.7%, 34.6% and 7.7%, respectively. Transparent fibers were observed as the predominant microplastics, which might be ingested accidently by fish or transferred through other animals at lower trophic levels. Majority of microplastics were identified as polyester (44%) and nylon (38%), whereas polypropylene (6%), polyethylene (6%), and acrylics (6%) were also found. Relatively, higher microplastic abundances were found in demersal fish compared to the pelagic species.

Long term dynamic based on date-prints on stranded debris,"Rivers are a major pathway for plastics between lands and the ocean. At the land-ocean interface, estuaries make the transfer dynamic of plastics complex and nonlinear. That is why very little is known about this dynamic. In this respect, a specific marker (i.e. Microlax packaging) showing date-prints was systematically investigated in different riverbanks of the Seine estuary to identify the share of ?€?old?€? and ?€?recent?€? litter transiting through the estuary toward the ocean. Up to 70% of Microlax were ?€?old?€? plastic items probably related to the meandering dynamic of the river over large time and space scales, and hydrodynamic conditions (tides) at smaller scales. This contributes together to increase the residence time of plastics into the estuary up to decades with almost endless transport, deposit and remobilization cycles. Consequently, the Seine estuary may function as a ?€?microplastic factory?€? resulting from the fragmentation of macroplastics into microplastics well before they reach the ocean. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

A total of eight MPs were retrieved from a total of 140 individual fish examined, with an average of 0.057 ?? 0.019 microplastic items per fish (excluding possible plastic fibers). On average, 5.71%, of the fish dissected contained MPs, ranging from 5 to 15% of individual fish examined containing MPs among species (Siganus canaliculatus and Rastrelliger kanagurta, respectively). Ingested plastic consisted primarily of fishing threads (1.04 ?? 0.06 mm), followed by fragments (1.16 ?? 0.11 mm). It is likely that the fibers, originated from the fisheries, recreational boating, laundry, domestic wastewater, and other human activities, which is also widespread and abundant (found in 58.58% of the fish studied).

Microplastics ultimately degrade into nano and smaller-sizes. In turn, their biological and ecological impacts become more complicated and ambiguous. Nano-plastic particles travel from freshwater systems to estuarine and oceanic regions, during which they can interact with dissolved organic matter (DOM) to form microgels. Microgel formation is ubiquitous in aquatic systems, serving as a shunt between DOM and particulate organic matter (POM), as well as playing key roles in particle aggregation/sedimentation and pollutant transport. Currently the influences and mechanisms of the aggregation behavior and environmental fate of nano-plastics in different aquatic environments is poorly understood. Here, we report that 25 nm polystyrene nano-particles in lake and river water can promote POM (microgel) formation and accelerate the DOM?€?POM transition. We also adjusted various salinities of water samples to simulate scenarios based on plastic transport in waters flowing from rivers to seas. The results indicate polystyrene nanoparticles can interact with organic matter to form large organic particles, which may undergo further settling in response to specific salinity levels. Polystyrene-induced microgel formation appears to involve the hydrophobic interactions between plastics and DOM. Our data provides much needed information for modeling and understanding the retention and sedimentation of nano-plastics. We show that nano-plastics alter the DOM?€?POM shunt to cause unanticipated perturbations in the functionality of aquatic ecosystems. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

The results revealed that low microalgae supply increased microplastic ingestion through enhancing the encounter rates, and moreover increased the retention time of 0.5 ??m microplastics. When the microalgae concentration was 1 ?? 103 cells/mL, 0.5 ??m microplastics could be observed in the copepods after depuration in clear seawater for 24 h, but almost totally excreted at 1 ?? 105 cells/mL of microalgae.

Microplastics are particularly abundant in the Mediterranean Sea, potentially exerting substantial pressures on marine organisms at different levels of organization. Ingestion of microplastics has been observed in a large number of marine species. The aim of this work is to test if microplastics produce a feeding impairment in Astroides calycularis, a shallow water, habitat-forming coral endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. Our findings suggest a lack of any avoidance mechanism allowing the polyps to discern between food items and microplastics when occurring simultaneously. Moreover, polyps spend a considerable amount of time on handling microplastic particles. As a consequence, microplastics impair the feeding efficiency in A. calycularis, since polyps may not be fully able to profit from the drifting plankton aggregations. Therefore, we suggest that microplastics can cause a reduction of fitness in A. calycularis, and presumably also in other species characterized by suspension feeding strategy. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

The thick shell mussels Mytilus coruscus were exposed to four concentrations of polystyrene microspheres (diameter 2 ??m, 0, 10, 104 and 106 particles/L) under two pH levels (7.7 and 8.1) for 14 days followed by a 7-day recovery acclimation. Throughout the experiment, we found that microplastics and ocean acidification exerted little oxidative stress to the digestive gland. Only catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) showed a significant increase along with increased microplastics during the experiment, but recovered to the control levels once these stressors were removed. No significant effects of pH and microplastics on glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were observed. The responses of digestive enzymes to both stressors were more pronounced than antioxidant enzymes. During the experiment, pepsin (PES), trypsin (TRS), alpha-amylase (AMS) and lipase (LPS) were significantly inhibited under microplastics exposure and this inhibition was aggravated by acidification conditions. Only PES and AMS tended to recover during the recovery period. Lysozyme (LZM) increased significantly under microplastic exposure conditions, but acidification did not exacerbate this effect. Therefore, combined stress of microplastics and ocean acidification slightly impacts oxidative responses but significantly inhibits digestive enzymes in mussels. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Fibers constituted the most common MPs shape and polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) were major polymer types in the samples. The distribution of MPs in the study area reflected a patchy and irregular spatial pattern implying that the higher MPs concentration are near mouth of permanent rivers and in the regions with higher level of the fishing and tourism activities. The results showed the wide occurrence of MPs in the sediments of the world's largest lake which extend the knowledge on MPs pollution in the marine system.

2NK5WS2Y,10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.104876,Adverse effects of plastic ingestion on the Mediterranean small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula),"Plastics are widely diffused in the oceans and their ingestion by marine organisms is raising concern for potentially adverse effects. The risk of harmful interactions with marine plastic pollution depends on the biology of the species as well as the distribution and abundance of the different plastic types. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of plastic ingestion by the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula), one of the most abundant elasmobranchs in the Mediterranean Sea. The expression levels of genes indicative of total immune system function were analyzed to gather preliminary data for further investigation of any potential correlations between plastic presence and immune activation. One hundred catsharks were collected during the Spring 2018 in two geographic locations in the southern region of the central Mediterranean Sea: 1) near Mazara del Vallo, SW Sicily and 2) near Lampedusa island, Italy's southernmost. Standard measurements were recorded for each specimen and its organs and sex was determined. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was preserved for plastic detection and identification. Where present, plastics (macro- and micro-) were characterized in terms of size, shape and polymer typology through microscopy and ??-Raman spectroscopy. Spleen from a subset of thirty samples was preserved for RNA extraction, then used to quantify by real time PCR the transcripts of T cell receptor beta (TCRB), T cell receptor delta (TCRD) and IgM genes. The results indicated that ingestion of plastic is widespread, with microplastics (MP, from 1 ??m to <1 mm) abundantly present in nearly all samples and macroplasticplastic (MaP, > 1 cm) in approximately 18% of the specimens collected. A significant increase in the expression of TCRB, TCRD and IgM was observed in the spleen of MaP + specimens from Mazara del Vallo waters, in parallel with 67% increase in liver weight. While the presence of MP alone is not enough to induce a strong activation of the immunity, some type of plastics falling into the MaP category may be more toxic than others and crucial in the activation of the immune response. The results of this study represent a first evidence that plastic pollution represents an emerging threat to S. canicula, the Mediterranean food web and human consumers. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
4YQQJ6LA,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113844,Sorption of PAHs to microplastic and their bioavailability and toxicity to marine copepods under co-exposure conditions,"Organic chemical pollutants associated with microplastic (MP) may represent an alternative exposure route for these chemicals to marine biota. However, the bioavailability of MP-sorbed organic pollutants under conditions where co-exposure occurs from the same compounds dissolved in the water phase has rarely been studied experimentally, especially where pollutant concentrations in the two phases are well characterized. Importantly, higher concentrations of organic pollutants on ingested MP may be less bioavailable to aquatic organisms than the same chemicals present in dissolved form in the surrounding water. In the current study, the sorption kinetics of two model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; fluoranthene and phenanthrene) to MP particles in natural seawater at 10 and 20 ??C were studied and the bioavailability of MP-sorbed PAHs to marine copepods investigated. Polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) microbeads with mean diameters ranging from 10 to 200 ??m were used to identify the role of MP polymer type and size on sorption mechanisms. Additionally, temperature dependence of sorption was investigated. Results indicated that adsorption dominated at lower temperatures and for smaller MP (10 ??m), while absorption was the prevailing process for larger MP (100 ??m). Monolayer sorption dominated at lower PAH concentrations, while multilayer sorption dominated at higher concentrations. PE particles representing ingestible (10 ??m) and non-ingestible (100 ??m) MP for the marine copepod species Acartia tonsa and Calanus finmarchicus were used to investigate the availability and toxicity of MP-sorbed PAHs. Studies were conducted under co-exposure conditions where the PAHs were also present in the dissolved phase (Cfree), thereby representing more environmentally relevant exposure scenarios. Cfree reduction through MP sorption was reflected in a corresponding reduction of lethality and bioaccumulation, with no difference observed between ingestible and non-ingestible MP. This indicates that only free dissolved PAHs are significantly bioavailable to copepods under co-exposure conditions with MP-sorbed PAHs. ?? 2019 The Authors MP-sorbed PAHs do not significantly accumulate or contribute to toxicity in marine copepods when co-exposed with the same chemicals in the dissolved phase. ?? 2019 The Authors",

They are often assumed to be microplastics, but include natural as well as synthetic textile fibres and are perhaps best treated as a separate class of pollutants given the challenges they pose in terms of identification and contamination. Microfibres have been largely ignored by traditional methods used to sample floating microplastics at sea, which use 300?€?500 ??m mesh nets that are too coarse to sample most textile fibres. There is thus a need for a consistent set of methods for sampling microfibres in seawater. We processed bulk water samples through 0.7?€?63 ??m filters to collect microfibres in three ocean basins. Fibre density increased as mesh size decreased: 20 ??m mesh sampled 41% more fibres than 63 ??m, and 0.7 ??m filters sampled 44% more fibres than 25 ??m mesh, but mesh size (20?€?63 ??m) had little effect on the size of fibres retained. Fibre density decreased with sample volume when processed through larger mesh filters, presumably because more fibres were flushed through the filters. Microfibres averaged 2.5 times more abundant at the sea surface than in water sampled 5 m sub-surface. However, the data were noisy; counts of replicate 10-L samples had low repeatability (0.15?€?0.36; CV = 56%), suggesting that single samples provide only a rough estimate of microfibre abundance. We propose that sampling for microfibres should use a combination of <1 ??m and 20?€?25 ??m filters and process multiple samples to offset high within-site variability in microfibre densities. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Information on the occurrence and characteristics of microplastics in Australia is limited and their interactions with chemical contaminants have not been addressed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to generate baseline information on the physical and chemical characteristics of microplastics on Australian shorelines to facilitate further detailed risk assessment. Field collected microplastics were categorised by colour, shape and polymer type. Plastic particles were primarily clear, blue, white and green and consisted mainly of fragments (57.80%) and pellets (30.68%). Polymer characterisation revealed that shoreline microplastics were polyethylene (53.17%), polypropylene (35.17%), polystyrene (6.61%) and polyethylene terephthalate (1.85%). Analysis of metal(loid)s found that concentrations of Mn, Cr, Cu, As, Zn and Pb were significantly higher on microplastics associated with industrial locations compared with other land uses, indicating that aged microplastics have the potential to adsorb toxic metals and that metals levels may be location-dependent. ?? 2020",

In particular, marine predators are often exposed to accidental plastic ingestion, that may negatively affect survival due to the concentration of debris in the digestive tract. Among the species most vulnerable to plastic ingestion, seabirds are of major interest for conservation because of their wide foraging areas, long generation time and extended lifespan. We analysed stomach contents of 90 seabird specimens from 12 different species collected in New Caledonia to assess the local prevalence of plastic ingestion. Overall, we found plastic debris in 14.4% of sampled individuals, exclusively in procellariids: Gould's Petrel (41.2%, highest incidence), Tahiti Petrel (33.3%) and Wedge-tailed Shearwater (7.7%). To our knowledge, this study is the first characterization of plastic ingestion in seabirds from New Caledonia and our results show an overall lower ingestion prevalence compared to other assessments in the tropical Pacific. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
VM4SRCZN,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113766,Distribution and characterization of microplastic particles and textile microfibers in Adriatic food webs: General insights for biomonitoring strategies,"This study provided a comprehensive characterization on ingestion of different typologies of microplastics in several fish and invertebrate species from the Adriatic Sea, considered as a preferential area of plastic accumulation in the Mediterranean. Almost 500 organisms were sampled in the three sectors of Northern, Central and Southern Adriatic, testing the hypothesis that area of collection, habitat and feeding strategy might influence the occurrence of plastic particles in biota. In this study, the overall characterization considered separately plastic microparticles (MPs) from textile microfibers (MFs) which also included natural and semi-synthetic ones. Ingestion of MPs was a widespread phenomenon, but their number (typically 1 or 2) did not reveal any significant relationship with biometric values, geographical areas or ecological features of the species. Conversely, the frequency of ingestion, ranging from 13 to 35% of organisms containing MPs, appeared a more reliable index to highlight such differences, revealing higher values in species from Central and Southern basins compared to the Northern one, as well as in benthopelagic compared to benthic or pelagic organisms. Geographical differences also occurred in terms of size and typology of ingested particles, suggesting the importance of local river runoffs and surface currents dynamics. Textile microfibers (MFs) were also abundant in Adriatic food webs occurring in all the analyzed species with average numbers (3?€?10) and frequencies (40?€?70%) higher than those reported for MPs; further, an elevated percentage of MFs (>80%) was of natural or semi-synthetic origin. Overall, this study provided general insights toward the harmonization of a common biomonitoring strategy, as in the context of MSFD, including the suggestion of a frequency-based index and of a multi-species approach to increase the ecological relevance of assessment, as well as the comparability between different areas and trophic webs. An extensive characterization revealed the distribution of microplastic particles and textile microfibers in several fish and invertebrates from the Adriatic Sea. Frequency of ingestion appeared a more reliable index than number of ingested particles to reveal geographical differences which occurred in terms of size and typology of particles. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

A comparison between aerial photography and observer-based methods to monitor floating marine litter and marine mega-fauna,"Pollution by marine litter is raising major concerns due to its potential impact on marine biodiversity and, above all, on endangered mega-fauna species, such as cetaceans and sea turtles. The density and distribution of marine litter and mega-fauna have been traditionally monitored through observer-based methods, yet the advent of new technologies has introduced aerial photography as an alternative monitoring method. However, to integrate results produced by different monitoring techniques and consider the photographic method a viable alternative, this ?€?new?€? methodology must be validated. This study aims to compare observations obtained from the concurrent application of observer-based and photographic methods during aerial surveys. To do so, a Partenavia P-68 aircraft equipped with an RGB sensor was used to monitor the waters off the Spanish Mediterranean coast along 12 transects (941 km). Over 10000 images were collected and checked manually by a photo-interpreter to detect potential targets, which were classified as floating marine macro-litter, mega-fauna and seabirds. The two methods allowed the detection of items from the three categories and proved equally effective for the detection of cetaceans, sea turtles and large fish on the sea surface. However, the photographic method was more effective for floating litter detection and the observer-based method was more effective for seabird detection. These results provide the first validation of the use of aerial photography to monitor floating litter and mega-fauna over the marine surface. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

In Svalbard, for example, plastics are found on the shorelines, in the water column, on the ocean floor and in the ice. Organisms have been observed to be entangled in nets and ingestion of plastics has been documented in a range of organisms. Notably almost all Arctic bird species have been found to have ingested plastic, with Northern fulmars being particularly affected, with 89 % of samples recorded as having ingested plastic. Identification and valuation of ecosystem services affected by marine plastic pollution can provide input for decision makers in evaluating and comparing management policies concerning this unique environment. This study employs the contingent valuation method (CVM) for eliciting the willingness to pay (WTP) of Norwegian households for reducing marine plastic pollution around the archipelago of Svalbard. An Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model (ICLV) is employed to explore attitudinal determinants of WTP. We find an average WTP for an initiative to reduce marine plastics of NOK 5,485 (USD 642) per household per year. The ICLV results reveal that people who are relatively more concerned about marine plastic pollution and who deem the proposed initiative effective are willing to pay more (up to 85 % and 50 %, respectively). The use of ICLV models in CVM and recommendations for future research are discussed. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

Assessing marine plastic pollution directly is challenging, and an alternative is to use seabirds as bioindicators. Our analyses of long time-series (26-years) revealed substantial variation in the amount, characteristics and origin of marine debris (mainly macroplastics and mesoplastics, and excluding fishing gear) associated with seabirds at South Georgia, and, for two species, long-term increases in incidence since 1994. Annual debris recovery rates (items per capita) were 14 ?? higher in wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans, and 6 ?? higher in grey-headed albatrosses Thalassarche chrysostoma and giant petrels Macronectes spp., than in black-browed albatrosses T. melanophris, partly related to differences in egestion (regurgitation), which clears items from the proventriculus. Although some debris types were common in all species, wandering albatrosses and giant petrels ingested higher proportions that were food-related or generic wrapping, gloves, clear or mixed colour, and packaged in South America. This was highly likely to originate from vessels, including the large South American fishing fleets with which they overlap. Debris associated with the two smaller albatrosses was more commonly shorter, rigid (miscellaneous plastic and bottle/tube caps), and packaged in East Asia. Grey-headed albatrosses are exposed to large and increasing amounts of user plastics transported from coastal South America in the Subantarctic Current, or discarded from vessels and circulating in the South Atlantic Gyre, whereas the lower debris ingestion by black-browed albatrosses suggests that plastic pollution in Antarctic waters remains relatively low. Current plastic loads in our study species seem unlikely to have an impact at the population level, but the results nevertheless affirm that marine plastics are a major, trans-boundary animal-welfare and environmental issue that needs to be addressed by much-improved waste-management practices and compliance-monitoring both on land and on vessels in the south Atlantic. ?? 2020 The Authors",

Previous studies have addressed this environmental problem in either the marine or continental environment, but ignored the water bodies in between. Coastal lakes are transitional aquatic systems and may play an important role in transport, reworking and redistribution of plastics across catchment scale. Here, we report results of our investigation of plastic pollution in sediment of a coastal lake, the Dishui Lake, in Shanghai, China. The lake is located in coastal Shanghai and connected to the East China Sea via a 7-km long canal. Sediment samples were collected from around the lake and the canal. Plastic particles were detected in the sediment with various shapes, colors and compositions. The total particle count in the canal sediment was orders of magnitude higher than in the lake sediment. Polypropylene was the dominant polymer in the sediment. Our results suggest that coastal lakes can serve as a reworking zone for accumulation and reworkings of plastic particles, and a buffer zone contributing to plastic pollution in the marine environment. This study addresses the most understudied area of plastic pollution, i.e., reworking and redistribution of plastic debris at catchment scale across the marine and continental environment. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

However, the influence of microplastics on the uptake, depuration and toxicity of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) in marine organisms is unclear. We exposed the marine scallop Chlamys farreri to polystyrene microplastics (PS; 125 ??g/L) combined with BDE-209 (10 and 100 ??g/L) to determine their toxicokinetics, cellular toxicity and histopathological effects. The results showed that PS acted as both a carrier and a scavenger for the bioaccumulation of BDE-209. Importantly, the carrier role of PS was greater than scavenger one. PS increased the negative effect of BDE-209 (100 ??g/L) on hemocyte phagocytosis, and ultrastructural changes in gills and digestive gland of scallops due to their carrier role for the bioaccumulation of BDE-209. However, PS did not increase the DNA damage of BDE-209 on the hemocytes. These findings are evidence of microplastics transferring adsorbed pollutants to marine organisms, and increasing their toxicity. Greater carrier role of PS than scavenger one for accumulation of BDE-209 led to their increased negative effect on phagocytosis and ultrastructural changes in scallops. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Both observations are the northernmost record of the species found in the Colombian Caribbean Sea. The above finding opens a new door that suggests that larval dispersion alone may not be the only process responsible for the presence of this invasive suspension-feeder bivalve because this species needs specific vectors for its dispersal. Some organisms such Perna viridis can persist in the marine environment, but they do not necessarily have a rafting capability that allows them to move over long distances. Floating structures as well as marine debris can serve as optimal substrates in the marine environment, contributing to an increase in the problems of non-native species on sites with a high degree of susceptibility to species invasion. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Traditional monitoring programs are based on in-situ visual census, which require human effort and are time-demanding. Therefore, it is crucial to implement innovative mapping strategies to improve the environmental monitoring of marine litter on the coast. This work presents a procedure for an automated Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-based marine litter mapping on a beach-dune system. A multidisciplinary framework, which comprises photogrammetry, geomorphology, machine learning and hydrodynamic modelling, was developed to process a block of UAS images. The work shows how each of these scientific methodologies can be complementary to improve and making more efficient the mapping of marine litter items with UAS on coastal environment. The very high-resolution orthophoto produced from UAS images was automatically screened by random forest machine learning method, in order to characterize the marine litter load on beach and dune areas, distinctively. The marine litter objects were identified with a F-test score of 75% when compared to manual procedure. The location of major marine litter loads within the monitored area was found related to beach slope and water level dynamics on the beach profiles, suggesting that UAS flight deployment and post-processing for beach litter mapping can be optimized based on these environmental parameters. The described UAS-based marine litter detection framework is intended to support scientists, engineers and decision makers aiming at monitoring marine and coastal pollution, with the additional aim of optimizing and automating beach clean-up operations. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

However, how floating plastic debris is transported to coastal lagoons and marine conservation units is still poorly understood. This work determined the level of contamination due to floating plastic debris in Acara?? Lagoon by establishing density distribution patterns along the lagoon ecocline in the winter and summer. Four areas were chosen that followed the estuarine gradient of the lagoon (external, lower, middle, and upper), and in each area, three samples of were collected by trawling with a plankton net. The plastic debris was classified into paint fragments, hard solids, plastic filaments, and soft plastics, and the plastic debris density and surface area were determined in each sampling area. The concentrations of the plastics in the downstream and upstream areas resulted from the high density of debris that occurred during the winter due to the absence of rain and the entry of coastal waters into the lagoon. The reduced abundance and surface area of the plastics in the summer were related to the substantial output of water from the interior of the lagoon to the mouth of the lagoon due to high rainfall during this season. The absence of plastic waste management actions and developed areas at the mouth of the lagoon that were associated with the spatial and temporal fluctuations in the environmental variables favored the occurrence and high abundance of plastic debris in the water column, contaminating the entire system of Acara??

In 2016, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and made a call for further research testing hypotheses about ecological effects. In the subsequent years, the amount of relevant research has risen tremendously. Here, we reassess the literature to determine the current weight of evidence about the effects of plastic pollution across all levels of biological organization. Our data spans marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. We extracted data from 139 lab and field studies testing 577 independent effects across a variety of taxa and with various types, sizes, and shapes of plastic. Overall, 59% of the tested effects were detected. Of these, 58% were due to microplastics and 42% were due to macroplastics. Of the effects that were not detected, 94% were from microplastics and 6% were from macroplastics. We found evidence that whether or not an effect is detected, as well as the severity and direction of the effect, is driven by dose, particle shape, polymer type, and particle size. Based on our analyses, there is no doubt that macroplastics are causing ecological effects, however, the effects of microplastics are much more complex. We also assessed the environmental relevancy of experimental studies by comparing the doses used in each exposure to the concentrations and sizes of microplastics found in the environment. We determined that only 17% of the concentrations used in experimental studies have been found in nature, and that 80% of particle sizes used in experiments fall below the size range of the majority of environmental sampling. Based on our systematic review and meta-analysis, we make a call for future work that recognizes the complexity of microplastics and designs tests to better understand how different types, sizes, shapes, doses, and exposure durations affect wildlife. We also call for more ecologically and environmentally relevant studies, particularly in freshwater and terrestrial environments. ?? 2019 by the Ecological Society of America",

The megafauna accounted for 3444 specimens referred to 133 taxa (91 invertebrates and 42 fishes), for a biomass of 102 kg and including species of wide ecological and commercial interest. Metrics of community structure yielded high values. The NIPS, hence, is characterized by a high biodiversity.

The putative origin of most items was land-based (83.6%), whereas sea-based litter accounted for 16.4%. More than 50% of the litter items found showed colonization by invertebrates and/or molluscan egg masses. Marine benthic litter, thus, locally constitutes a complex issue since litter items hosted complex communities of fouling organisms.

In the present study, the enantioselective environmental behaviors of methamphetamine co-exposed with microplastics through an aquatic food chain (from Chlorella pyrenoidosa to Cipangopaludian cathayensis) have been investigated in a laboratory environment. It was found that the acute toxicity of methamphetamine against these two species was significantly increased in the presence of microplastics: Chlorella pyrenoidosa showed an EC50 shift from 0.77 to 0.32 mg L???1, while cipangopaludian cathayensis showed an LC50 shift from 4.15 to 1.48 mg L???1, upon the addition of microplastics as a co-contaminant with methamphetamine.

The main source of fragmented polyethylene is the generally used mechanical peelings. Methods: The analysis included 130 scrub-type cosmetic preparations available in the Polish market. Proportional shares of the preparations with polyethylene, natural or mixed abrasive ingredient were determined. The types and frequencies of using natural abrasive materials and biodegradable polymers were characterised. It was analysed if the professional and generally available products differ in this respect. Results: Among the analysed cosmetics, 72 (55%) included polyethylene, and for professional cosmetics, this proportion was 100. Compositions of drugstore cosmetics are varied, with many abrasive substances of natural origin, and only sometimes with polyethylene. Conclusions: The differences observed between generally available cosmetics and professional cosmetics are surprising and indicate a greater ecological awareness of individual clients. The problem will be raised in the coming years more and more frequently, and, as proved by this analysis, manufacturers of professional cosmetics are not ready for this yet, and they have no alternative ecological solutions. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

Numerical modeling of plastic debris transport and accumulation throughout Portuguese coast. In: Malv??rez, G. and Navas, F. (eds.), Global Coastal Issues of 2020. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 95, pp. 1252-1257. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Microplastic (MP) accumulation and dispersal is a growing problem at a global marine scale. The accumulation of MPs in aquatic systems is increasing due to their high perseverance and inadequate management, affecting all marine environments and could adversely affect ecosystem services and even human health. The study of these contaminants, namely their concentration and spatial distribution, as well as their physical characteristics, is fundamental, to mitigate and reduce the associated risks. Due to the high population density living on the Portuguese coast, this area is a zone of high contamination by MPs, being the rivers their main transport mode to coastal waters. In order to understand the distributions of MPs and the way they evolve in space and time, is essential to develop studies in this area. Thus, the purpose of this study is to simulate the transport and accumulation of MPs along the Portuguese coast and adjacent waters. The methodology followed comprised the development and implementation of a three-dimensional model using the Delft3D suite, coupling the Flow and particle-tracking (D-WAQ PART) models. Modeling predictions show that all MPs move to north following the local hydrodynamics. The higher density MPs with diameters of 5 mm tend to sink more than those of lower density with 10 mm diameters, which in turn tend to travel longer distances.. The main factors that influence the distribution and accumulation of MPs in the study area are the local hydrodynamic and geomorphology, and the MPs diameter. These results have a large number of applications, including detecting optimal removal locations, reducing the impact on the ecosystem, and understanding the flows of MPs pollution. ??

Despite its plastic waste import ban in 2017, this populous economy inevitably generates a large amount of waste, including plastic waste, a considerable part of which has become marine litter. Data from the 2018 National Coastal Cleanup and Monitoring Project, the largest beach litter monitoring activities using the citizen science approach in China, have been retrieved and analyzed to understand spatial patterns, composition, and original usage of marine litter. Within this project, 24 beaches were surveyed every two months. As a result, the mean density was 3.85 ?? 5.39 items m???2, much higher than that reported by previous studies in China. There were great differences in the spatial distribution of litter. The highest densities appeared in the runoff-affected area of the Yangtze River, which was another difference from previous studies. Low-density, easy-to-transport foamed plastics were the major contributor to marine litter in these areas. Along China's coast, approximately 90% of litter was from land-based sources, and over half of that originated from domestic sources. Including foamed plastic products, plastic litter with low recycling value dominated. Both natural and human factors influencing the spatiotemporal distribution and composition of litter are discussed. Socioeconomic factors, such as the lifestyle and consumption levels of citizens and local waste management systems, are possible explanations for the low-value characteristic of marine litter. The deviation between previous data and citizen science data in this study may be caused by many factors. Based on the discussion on these factors, some suggestions for citizen science research in China are also put forward. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
K4K3XBNC,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.110910,Numerical modeling of the beach process of marine plastics: A probabilistic and diagnostic approach with a particle tracking method,"A model of the beach process of marine plastics was proposed based on the assumption of the beaching and backwashing flux balance, and its applicability was examined by means of time-invariant linear system analysis and particle tracking experiments with respect to the ratio between the residence time of plastics on a beach (??r) and the period of nearshore current variability (T0). Based on the theory, the balance was expected to hold when ??r/T0 was much smaller than 1; however, good agreement was obtained between the theory and the particle tracking method for much larger values of ??r/T0. The parameters, which are diagnostically given in the model, will be prognostically decided by the coastal dynamics in the future to develop robust beach process models. Nevertheless, we believe that a diagnostic approach would be another pillar in the strategy for estimating the amounts and distributions of marine plastics in the coming years. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

While it has been suggested that the immune responses of aquatic organisms could be hampered by exposure to microplastics and POPs, the synergistic immunotoxic impact of these two types of pollutants remain poorly understood. In addition, little is known about the mechanism behind the immunotoxic effect of microplastics. Therefore, in the present study, the immunotoxicity of microplastics and two POPs, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and 17??-estradiol (E2), were investigated alone or in combination in a bivalve species, Tegillarca granosa. Evident immunotoxicity, as indicated by alterations of haemocyte count, blood cell composition, phagocytic activity, intracellular content of ROS, concentration of Ca2+ and lysozyme, and lysozyme activity, was revealed for both microplastics and the two POPs examined. In addition, the expression of six immune-, Ca2+ signalling-, and apoptosis-related genes was significantly altered by exposure of clams to the contaminants studied. Furthermore, the toxicity of POPs was generally aggravated by smaller microplastics (500 nm) and mitigated by larger ones (30 ??m). This size dependent effect on POP toxicity may result from size dependent interactions between microplastics and POPs. Data obtained in this study also indicate that similar to exposure to B[a]P and E2, exposure to microplastics may hamper the immune responses of clams through a series of interdependent physiological and molecular processes. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

The main intent of this article is to share an example of good practice about the use of this case study in geography lessons in Czechia. The aim of the study was twofold: to develop an understanding about how plastics contribute to ocean pollution, as a serious and current ecological topic in Global Education; as well as to show how the characteristics and movement of ocean water are related to the topic of ocean pollution. The main research goal was to study how pupils were able to put their skills and knowledge in practice by fulfilling the objective of the teaching activity to understand global ocean pollution. The teaching activity is based on methods which develop principles of critical thinking, learning by living, brainstorming, discussion, and group teaching. The te aching activity also allows for cross curricular links to occur between school geography and other subjects including biology, physics, civic education, ecological education, and personal and social education. The teaching activities for the 'New Age Atlan tis' case study is aimed at pupils aged between 12 to 15 years. The case study results confirm that as pupils collaborate and communicate with their peers and teachers, they learn to critically accept the opinions of others and, at the same time, to defend their own opinions. All of the pupils were able to understand and recognize the problem at hand. ?? RIGEO.",
29CJTCIQ,10.1002/rhc3.12180,Can the Global Problem of Marine Litter Be Considered a Crisis?,"Marine plastic litter and microplastics pollution is a global governance problem with unknown and potentially dire consequences. Efforts to promote individual-centered solutions to the problem are increasingly necessary but are insufficient to tackle the root causes of the problem. Therefore, a concerted policy response at the global level is imperative. The success of such efforts necessarily depends on the way in which the problem is framed and understood, including its degree of urgency. This paper engages with this problem by considering the nature of the issue in light of the crisis term and argues that the global problem of marine litter may be more productively considered a ?€?creeping crisis?€? given the complexity, scope, and spatio-temporally fragmented nature of the problem. ?? 2019 Policy Studies Organization",

Microlitter was extracted from sediment using a concentrated hypersaline solution (1.2 g cm???3), filtered with 0.45-??m porosity and black grid membranes and examined using a binocular microscope. Items were counted, dimensionally measured and classified according to type, shape, colour and appearance. A total of 56 torrent and sea sediment samples revealed the presence of 4,302 items. The mean concentrations were 1.5 items cm???3?? 1.3 standard deviation (SD) and 1.6 items cm???3?? 1.3 SD for torrent samples and sea sediment samples, respectively. Transparent fibres predominated, followed by fragments. The most common colour was white-cream. In total, 1.8% of items were analysed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) 2D imaging, using a focal plane array (FPA) detector to identify their composition. Nylon was the most common plastic polymer type; however, approximately 50% of the analysed samples consisted of cotton transparent fibres. The influences of human activities (cities, port and discharges) on microlitter composition were highlighted and torrents were confirmed as a vector of microlitter from land to sea. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

A component of plastic litter and debris is single-use, expanded polystyrene (EPS) food service ware. Reducing the consumption of EPS food service ware is challenging because reuse is not feasible, recycling is not eco-nomically viable, and composting is not possible. In the absence of national action to reduce EPS in the USA, local governments have taken the lead on enacting or-dinances to eliminate or reduce EPS food service ware. This paper examined the variety of policy instruments that can or have been used by local governments in the USA to reduce EPS food service ware. Because of the inabilities to reuse, recycle, and/or compost EPS, the most frequently used policy instrument has been a ban. As of December 2019, there were 249 local bans in the USA covering 12.85% of the nation?€?s population: of these bans, 9.6% were partial bans restricting distribution only on government and public property, 65.9% were narrow bans that ban distribution by restaurants and food providers, 8.8% were full bans that include the narrow ban and also ban using EPS food packaging by grocery stores, and 15.7% adopted an expanded ban that includes the full ban and also baned other single-use plastic food ware related items including the selling or distributing of EPS coolers and single-use plastic utensils, straws, stirrers, lids, cups, plates, and containers. ?? 2019 Cisa Publisher.",

To solve this, tight sandstones taken from borehole CSDP-2 of the Permian Longtan (P2l) Formation were systemically investigated with high-precision pore-throat characterization methods. The results show that pore-throat structures of tight sandstones in the Longtan Formation can be classified into three categories with synthesis considerations of pore-throat type, size, and connectivity; these pore-throats are denoted lattice-like, tubular, and isolated, respectively. The lattice-like pore throats with relatively larger radii (&gt;0.1 ??m) and higher connectivity exhibit the best performance for reservoir quality, followed by tubular pore-throat structures, while isolated pore throats have almost no capacity to migrate or store fluids. In the formation mechanism of various pore-throat structures, both the plastic component content and complex diagenesis play a significant role. Strong compaction results in a loss of nearly half of the initial porosity (av. 49.81%) during the initial diagenetic stage. Then, clay mineral cements partially occlude pores and throats, which are the dominant factors in the transition of pore-throat structures from lattice-like to tubular. Silica and carbonate cementation are the key processes that fill the primary pore throats, secondary dissolution pores, and microfractures, leading to the formation of isolated pore-throat structures and low-porosity, ultra-low-permeability reservoirs. Feldspar dissolution cannot take place on a large scale due to the early densification of the sandstone, and it does not significantly improve the reservoir quality; it increases the porosity by less than 4.0%. This research provides constructive insights into the coupled evolution of pore-throat structures and diagenetic processes, which can aid in further understanding the formation mechanism of tight sandstones. In practice, this work also provides a scientific basis for identifying effective reservoirs, and promotes petroleum exploration in the South Yellow Sea Basin, China. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

In this study, we studied (i) whether the presence of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microparticles may affect cadmium (Cd) uptake in mussel (Mytilus edulis); and (ii) the biological effects of PVC microparticles exposure alone or in combination with Cd. Significant Cd uptake in digestive gland was observed following Cd exposure. However, PVC did not significantly increase Cd uptake compared with Cd alone treatment. In terms of biological impacts, significantly lower neutral red retention (NRR) time and elevated expression of Metallothionein isoform 20-IV (MT-20) were observed in mussels exposed to Cd alone, or combined with microplastics, yet there was no significant difference between them. catalase (CAT) expression only showed a significant increase in mussels exposed to Cd alone.

Less selective responses to habitat cues by settling larvae can lead to broader distributions of species and potentially successful introduction to new geographic locations. This study tested whether marine biofilms, which serve as habitat cues for many invertebrates, enhance settlement and metamorphosis (molting) of megalopae of the invasive Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus. Biofilms were allowed to develop on plastic mesh netting deployed in coastal locations with abundant rocky substrate (adult habitat) and estuarine locations with few rocks. Molting rates of laboratory-reared megalopae maintained with biofilm-covered netting were determined. Controls consisted of mesh netting without field-derived biofilms and seawater without netting. Experiments were also conducted with megalopae of a native species of estuarine mud crab, Dyspanopeus sayi, for comparison of responses. Both species molted faster in response to field biofilms regardless of habitat of biofilm development, although the response to biofilms compared to netting without biofilms was stronger for H. sanguineus than D. sayi. The broad response of megalopae of both species to biofilms suggests that positive responses to biofilms and physical structure could be important for successful colonization of crab species in general. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

In this study, we investigated the relative importance of shear forces and surface hydrophobicity on biofilm development by two coccoid cyanobacteria with different biofilm formation capacities. The strong biofilm-forming Synechocystis salina was used along with the weaker biofilm-forming Cyanobium sp. Biofilms were developed in defined hydrodynamic conditions using glass (a model hydrophilic surface) and a polymeric epoxy coating (a hydrophobic surface) as substrates. Biofilms developed in both surfaces at lower shear conditions contained a higher number of cells and presented higher values for wet weight, thickness, and chlorophyll a content. The impact of hydrodynamics on biofilm development was generally stronger than the impact of surface hydrophobicity, but a combined effect of these two parameters strongly affected biofilm formation for the weaker biofilm-producing organism. The antibiofilm performance of the polymeric coating was confirmed at the hydrodynamic conditions prevailing in ports. Shear forces were shown to have a profound impact on biofilm development in marine settings regardless of the fouling capacity of the existing flora and the hydrophobicity of the surface. ?? 2020 by the authors.

Mechanical recycling is an important alternative to decrease the volume of polymeric waste. However, the mixture of different thermoplastic and other materials on the same object depreciates the properties of the recycled polymer due to the formation of immiscible blends. The aim of this study has been to evaluate the recycling of the post-industrial low-density polyethylene waste (LDPE waste) in presence of polypropylene using thermomechanical processing and thermochemical treatment of the material. For it, blends of LDPE waste and virgin polypropylene (PP) containing until 30 wt% of PP has been prepared with incorporation of zeolite ZSM-5 and Ziegler?€?Natta catalysts and submitted to the thermal treatment under controlled conditions of temperature and nitrogen flow. The results show the action of zeolite catalyst as modifier of the polymeric structure during step of the thermomechanical processing of the material. The catalysts have caused considerable changes on properties of the LDPE/PP blends, depending of the experimental conditions. The treatment of polymeric waste in presence of catalyst presents potential for recycling of polymeric materials with high contamination by other polymers and can generate recycled materials with improved properties. ?? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

Three-point bending tests were first conducted for pure Al tubes and Al/CFRP hybrid tubes with different wrapping angles. Experimental results showed that the enhancement effect of CFRP wrapping on energy absorption efficiency of hybrid structures was affected by several factors. Numerical analyses were then carried out by ABAQUS/Explicit, and good agreements were achieved between the simulation and experimental results. The validated numerical model was further employed to investigate the effects of the partial wrapping, wrapping angle and ply thickness on the crashworthiness of Al/CFRP hybrid tubes. Results showed that the increase of wrapping angle and ply thickness could enhance the bending resistance and delay or avoid the fracture of CFRP in the bottom flange. The Al/CFRP tube with appropriate partial wrapping could achieve 7.9% higher specific energy absorption (SEA) than the entirely wrapped counterpart. In addition, the sequential response surface method (SRSM) was adopted to optimize the structural parameters and to further improve the crashworthiness of the hybrid tubes. The SEA of the Al/CFRP tube was increased by up to 30.3% by the RSM optimization. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), almost one-third of the total food produced annually is wasted. This poses serious concern as not only there is loss of rich resources; their disposal in environment causes concern too. Food waste is rich in organic, thus traditional approaches of land-filling and incineration could cause severe environmental and human health hazard by generating toxic gases. Thus, employing biological methods for the treatment of such waste offers a sustainable way for valorization. This review comprehensively discusses state-of-art knowledge about various sources of food waste generation, their utilization, and valorization by exploiting microorganisms.

The average AL abundance was 6.05 items/m2, plastic items being the most common reaching a total percentage of 88.9% with an average density of 5.38 items/m2. Application of 3 evaluation indices, based on the AL data, placed most of the beaches into the status of unacceptable conditions of cleanness (Dirty to Extremely Dirty), and into mediocre to unsatisfactory environmental status. Hazardous anthropogenic litter (HAL), occurred in considerable amounts with hazardous items reaching a high of 7% (502 items of 7563 total items collected), and an average of 0.40 items/m2. Beaches were statistically grouped into four specific types that ranged from beaches in good environmental conditions (Group A) to beaches in extremely adverse environmental conditions (Group D). The typology and magnitudes of AL found along the study area suggest a combination of sources that are associated with the multiple usages developed along this region's coast. Anthropogenic litter is mainly related to land-based sources, and these generating source activities can be found in nearby basins and/or on the same beaches where the litter remains.

Our study investigated the survival and infectivity of the IJs on five different sponges compared to that in an aqueous suspension (control). The sponges were Oasis?? floral, Nanosponge, ScotchbriteTM, or Lysol?? and natural sea sponge. EPN species tested were Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Steinernema carpocapsae and S. feltiae. The recovery efficiency of the IJs from sponges was initially assessed. Subsequently, IJs were stored in the sponges and placed in plastic bags or Falcon tubes and incubated at 10?? or 27 ??C for 8 months or 11 weeks, respectively. IJ survival and infectivity were monitored monthly for the 10 ??C and weekly for 27 ??C in these sponge types. The IJs were recovered from the sponges, and their survival was based on observing their movement under a dissecting microscope, and infectivity was based on larval mortality in Galleria mellonella. Recovery efficiency of IJs was best for the Oasis floral sponge for all nematode species ranging between 83 and 91%. The survival and infectivity of stored IJs in all sponge types and control for both 10?? and 27 ??C gradually decreased over time. IJs stored in Scotchbrite, Lysol, and Nanosponge had the best survival and infectivity, whereas Oasis floral and natural sea sponges showed the poorest results. After 8 months at 10 ??C in plastic bags, the survival ratio of all IJs in these three sponges (Scotchbrite, Lysol, and Nanosponge) was approximately 55%. IJs in Scotchbrite and Nanosponge were also able to survive and retain their infectivity at 27 ??C for 3 months. IJs stored in Falcon tubes had survival that ranged from 26 to 53% at 27 ??C and 55 to 77% at 10 ??C. H. bacteriophora IJs lost their infectivity when stored at 27 ??C after 10 weeks. However, S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae exhibited 85% infectivity when stored in Scotchbrite and 50% in Nanosponge, respectively. Overall, sponges made from polyurethane (Scotchbrite) followed by melamine (Nanosponge) and cellulose (Lysol) are recommended for long-term nematode storage and transportation of nematode samples. However, Oasis floral sponge may be preferred for short-term IJ formulation for field applications because of easier recovery of IJs. ?? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",

However, PEG is prone to oxidation, which limits its practical use in the marine environment, and thus an alternative hydrophilic material would be desirable in the future development of amphiphilic coatings. In this regard, zwitterionic materials are emerging as a promising class of hydrophilic antifouling material, which we hypothesized would be a suitable alternative to PEG within amphiphilic coatings. To test this hypothesis, cross-linked amphiphilic films consisting of commercially available perfluoropolyethers and the zwitterionic monomer sulfobetaine methacrylate were developed and studied. The difficulty in formulating these chemically incompatible species was overcome by careful choice of solvents and a series of prototype cross-linked films were prepared in which increasing quantities of zwitterion were systematically incorporated. The fouling-release performance of these films was tested against the diatom Navicula incerta, a common microfouling organism responsible for the formation of so-called ?€?slime?€? layers, and antifouling performance with cypris larvae of two barnacle species, Balanus amphitrite, and Balanus improvisus. To expand the scope of the study, the clinically-relevant biofilm-forming pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, which is a major culprit in the infection and failure of millions of indwelling medical devices, was also evaluated. Results indicate that the incorporation of zwitterion into perfluoropolyethers leads to significant improvements in fouling-release performance and these amphiphilic coatings display potential in fouling-release applications. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

A grave ecological hazard in Cochin estuary, India","Distribution and ecological risks of Phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are poorly studied in estuarine environments in India. An attempt is made to chart the sources and assess the ecological risk of six PAE congeners (???6PAEs), present in dissolved and particulate forms in a tropical ecosystem (Cochin Estuary, India). Terrestrial input, as attested by a clear seasonality with substantial enrichment during monsoon (2?€?28 ??g/L and 31?€?1203 ??g/g; dissolved and particulate PAEs respectively) and post-monsoon (1?€?7 ??g/L and 7?€?321 ??g/g; dissolved and particulate PAEs respectively), was identified as the primary source. DnBP (di-n-butyl phthalate) and DEHP (diethylhexyl phthalate) were found to be the dominant species except for dissolved PAEs at pre-monsoon season. Statistical analysis identified two major clusters, in the ???6PAEs, composed of medium to high molecular weight PAEs (derived from plastic products) and low molecular weight PAEs (derived from cosmetic products). Calculated Risk Quotient (RQ) indicated values indicated moderate to high ecological risk for DnBP and DEHP congeners is a grim pointer to their detrimental effects on human health through consumption of contaminated organisms. Although substantial enrichment of suspended matter gets flushed out of the estuary during monsoon, there is a net PAE accumulation in the estuary during post-monsoon following an increased sedimentary restitution. Data of PAEs generated herein raises a challenge for immediate enactment of statutory legislation to curb and regulate hazardous contamination of estuaries by phthalic acid esters. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
34SC6J33,10.3390/ma13061381,Artificial neural network and response surface methodology based analysis on solid particle erosion behavior of polymer matrix composites,"Polymer-based fibrous composites are gaining popularity in marine and sports industries because of their prominent features like easy to process, better strength to weight ratio, durability and cost-effectiveness. Still, erosive behavior of composites under cyclic abrasive impact is a significant concern for the research fraternity. In this paper, the S type woven glass fibers reinforced polymer matrix composites (PMCs) are used to analyze the bonding behavior of reinforcement and matrix against the natural abrasive slurry. The response surface methodology is adopted to analyze the effect of various erosion parameters on the erosion resistance. The slurry pressure, impingement angle and nozzle diameter, were used as erosion parameters whereas erosion loss, i.e., weight loss during an erosion phenomenon was considered as a response parameter. The artificial neural network model was used to validate the attained outcomes for an optimum solution. The comparative analysis of response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models shows good agreement with the erosion behavior of glass fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites. ?? 2020 by the authors.

In this study, microcapsules containing biopolymers from cashew gum and gum Arabic have been prepared by interfacial polymerization. The prepared microcapsules were individually and combinatorially embedded into epoxy coatings and the resulting composite coatings were then applied on Q235 steel substrates. The performance of the composite coatings was evaluated by immersing both scribed and unscribed coatings in simulated seawater. Surface analytical (SEM), physico-chemical (FTIR, XRD, XPS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques were used to investigate self-healing and corrosion resistance effectiveness of the polymer composite coatings. The obtained results revealed that cashew gum and gum Arabic could heal the scribed coating surface and subsequently suppressed corrosion reaction, without the aid of any catalyst or co-reactant. The performance was observed to be higher when the two gum exudates were combined. Thus, cashew gum and gum Arabic have demonstrated that they possess properties required for potential utilization in the formulation of marine anticorrosion and self-healing epoxy coatings. ?? 2020, The Polymer Society, Taipei.",
YFQA8DT9,10.1002/aah.10097,"The Formation, Persistence, and Resistance to Disinfectant of the Erysipelothrix piscisicarius Biofilm","Erysipelothrix piscisicarius is an emergent pathogen in fish aquaculture, particularly in the ornamental fish trade. Very little is known on the biology of this pathogen; however, the recurrence of infection and disease outbreaks after removing the fish from a system and disinfecting the tank suggest its environmental persistence. Moreover, biofilm lifestyle in E. piscisicarius has been suspected but not previously shown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the formation of biofilms on an abiotic surface in Erysipelothrix spp. We used hydroxyapatite-coated plastic pegs to demonstrate the attachment, growth, and persistence of E. piscisicarius on abiotic surfaces in both fresh and marine environments and to investigate the susceptibility of this pathogen to different disinfectants that are used in the aquaculture industry. E. piscisicarius formed biofilms that persisted significantly longer than planktonic cells did in both freshwater and saltwater over a period of 120 h (P = 0.004). The biofilms were also more resistant to disinfectants than the planktonic cells were. Hydrogen peroxide was the most effective disinfectant against E. piscisicarius, and it eradicated the biofilms and planktonic cells at the recommended concentrations. In contrast, Virkon and bleach were able to eradicate only the planktonic cells. This information should be taken into consideration when developing biosecurity protocols in aquaculture systems, aquariums, and private collections. ?? 2020 American Fisheries Society",
LKBFTNJG,10.1016/j.porgcoat.2019.105483,Designed preparation of silicone protective materials with controlled self-healing and toughness properties,"Silicone elastomers with adjustable self-healing and mechanical properties have been prepared by the step-by-step synthesis procedure that 4,4?€?-methylenebis-(cyclohexyl isocyanate) (HMDI) and isophthalaldehyde (IPAL) sequentially cross-linked with aminopropyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (AP-PDMS). The characteristic imine and urea groups that related to self-healing ability and toughness have been detected in the silicone elastomers. The tensile stress of elastomers increases from ???3 KPa to ???1.0 MPa as increasing the ratio of urea to imine groups (0.35?€?3.3), while the elongation at the break still keeps in the range of 700???800 %. It was verified that the hydrogen bonding network exists in the self-healing polymers, which is responsible for its enhanced mechanical properties. The dynamic interaction of imine groups decreases with the increase of urea groups due to the limited movement of the polymer chain by hydrogen bonds, resulting in the degeneration of self-healing properties. Expectedly, the self-healing polymer (PDMS-UI-2) exhibits outstanding protective ability against corrosion of carbon steel in 3.5 % NaCl solution, owing to its rapid self-repairing property. Therefore, this work provides a facile and effective method to fabricate the self-healing silicon materials with adjustable self-repairing capability and mechanical property, which can be potentially used as protective coatings in the marine environment. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

In this study, integrated core, log, and production data from the Eocene basin-floor-fan turbidite reservoir demonstrates a new method to identify flow unit using factor analysis (FA) and supervised-mode self-organizing-map neural network (SSOM). The reservoirs were classified into four types of flow units (I, II, III and IV). Five principal factors were extracted through factor analysis on thirteen evaluation parameters for reflecting the characteristics of basin-floor-fan turbidite reservoirs. Then using the five principal factors as the input, the flow unit prediction model was established based on SSOM. The prediction results of flow unit based on FA-SSOM are consistent with the results of core analysis and test oil conclusion, which have a good classification effect. Therefore, the prediction model based on FA and SSOM provides an effective way for fine reservoir interpretation. The established FA-SSOM model is further compared with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Back Propagation (BP) neural network and has the best prediction. This study also sheds light on the remaining oil development by linking the identified flow unit type with daily production data. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

The wetlands of coastal zones represent transitional ecosystems that are affected by these conditions, although little is known about the hydrogeochemistry of wetlands, especially coastal wetlands. In the present study, the hydrogeochemical characterization of coastal freshwater herbaceous wetlands in the Ci??naga del Fuerte Protected Natural Area in Veracruz, Mexico, in the American tropics was carried out per plant community. Four herbaceous wetlands (alligator flag, saw grass, cattail, and floodplain pasture) were monitored to understand the origin of the water feeding these ecosystems, the hydrogeochemical composition of groundwater, and the relationship between the groundwater and ecology of these ecosystems during dry and rainy seasons. The results indicate that Ci??naga del Fuerte is located in a regional discharge area and receives local recharge, so it is fed by both regional and local flows. The chemical composition varied temporally and spatially, creating unique conditions that determined the habitat occupied by the hydrophytic vegetation. The spatiotemporal behaviour of groundwater is one factor that, along with the hydroperiod, determines wetland dynamics and affects wetland biota (ecohydrogeochemistry). Generalist plant communities established in zones of local recharge, whereas other more specialized and/or plastic communities inhabited zones receiving regional flows with greater ion concentrations. This information forms the basis for establishing an appropriate scale (municipal, state, or larger regions) for the sustainable management of goods and services provided by the wetlands. ?? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
3QXN4DKM,10.3391/AI.2020.15.1.06,Encapsulation as a biosecurity tool for managing fouling on recreational vessels,"Hull fouling is a dominant vector in marine systems, with recreational vessels playing an important role in intra-regional transfer of biota. Encapsulation (i.e. the wrapping of a structure in plastic to deprive biota of oxygen and food, ultimately causing their death), offers promise as a tool for treating vessel fouling in situ. However, there is currently no standardised approach with detailed field application recommendations. In recognition of this gap this study aimed to: 1) use laboratory experiments to establish a timeframe for the effective encapsulation of yachts, 2) test this approach in the field and 3) consider the practicalities associated with implementing an encapsulation program. Laboratory experiments exposed the ascidian Ciona robusta, the mussel Semimytilus algosus and fouling communities to four treatments: aerated control in seawater, encapsulation in seawater, aerated seawater with 4% acetic acid and encapsulation in seawater with 4% acetic acid. All biota in acetic acid died in 24 hours regardless of encapsulation, while in encapsulated seawater mortality of all taxa occurred within three days. In the field four yachts and five pontoons with high (80?€?100%) and low (30?€?50%) fouling cover were encapsulated. It took more than three days to achieve mortality on all structures (pontoons high cover 3.7 days (?? 0.48 SD); pontoons low cover 3.8 days (?? 0.42 SD) and yachts 4.3 days (?? 0.5 SD)). The discrepancy between laboratory and field results likely reflects an unavoidably higher water to fouling biomass ratio in field systems. These results suggest that five days may be sufficient for successful encapsulation of yachts. However, in recognition of the limited sample size of yachts in this study, it is recommended that these findings be used as a basis for further developing region specific protocols through adaptive management. Logistical considerations around the implantation of national encapsulation programs are also discussed. ?? Keanly and Robinson.",

The experimental program examines the flexural behavior of full-diameter T700/X4201 pipes under four-point bending and the tensile behavior of filament wound coupon specimens cut from the pipes. The tests show that the composite layup significantly influences the deformation, flexural resistance, and failure mechanisms of the composite pipes. The CFRP pipe with the optimal complex layup [(90/??15/90/??453)5/??453] design has higher ultimate resistance in bending than other designs with layups of [??45]28 and [90]56. Coupon tests show similar effects of composite layup on the tensile behavior of coupon specimens. The numerical effort evolves a three-dimensional progressive damage model to predict the failure in the CFRP coupons and pipes. The damage model incorporates a nonlinear in-plane shear behavior of the T700/X4201 composite material prior to damage initiation and uses a continuum damage mechanics approach to model the matrix and fiber damage progression in the composite pipes. The combined experimental-numerical work provides a more complete understanding of the bending behavior of large-scaled composite pipes, showing distinct failure modes for filament wound pipes with different layups. The load-displacement curves, ultimate bending resistance and failure modes of the composite pipes with different layups are accurately captured using the proposed damage model, demonstrating the capability for the failure analysis of large-scaled composite pipes such as composite risers in offshore applications. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

In this article, the modified viscoelastic model coupling with the thermodynamic model was established to describe the dynamic process of polymerization-induced phase separation in TP/TS blends system, in which the effects of TS curing reactions, the chain-length asymmetry, and molecular dynamic asymmetry between TP and TS were considered. Based on developed model, simulations were implemented to study phase morphology formation in phenolphthalein poly(ether ether ketone) (PEK-C)/epoxy blends system, and the influences of different factors, including initial PEK-C volume fraction, bulk modulus of PEK-C resin, curing reaction of epoxy resin, and curing temperature, on the phase separation behavior were investigated. Also, the experiments were carried out to verify the simulation results. The results revealed that there was an induction period before phase separation started; afterward, the bi-continuous structure appeared in mixtures, in which small concentration differences existed between two phases. As the initial PEK-C concentration increased, the final phase morphology experienced a gradual transition from the islands-sea structure to the bi-continuous structure, and finally formed the phase-inverted structure. Moreover, it was found that the phase morphology evolution was influenced by viscoelastic effect of polymer molecules. As the bulk modulus of PEK-C increases, the blends system tended to organize into a bi-continuous structure and the phase-inverted morphology at a lower initial content of PEK-C. ??

FVCCR4YT,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2019.100836,Increasing the efficiency of computational welding mechanics by combining solid and shell elements,"This paper emphasizes the benefits encountered when solid and shell elements are combined in a single 3-D finite element analysis (FEA) thermomechanical model - simulating a typical problem of computational welding mechanics. In order to clearly obtain the aforementioned benefits, FEA models containing only solid elements are compared with FEA models containing a combination of solids and shells. More specifically, in the current paper the post-weld heat treatment of a typical marine structure is simulated by using four different 3-D finite element analysis models. In the first model (model I), thermoplastic solid elements were used, whereas in the second model (model II), a mix of thermoplastic and thermoelastic solids was employed. In order to investigate whether the combination of solids with shells can substantially increase the computational efficiency, and therefore reduce the duration of the analyses and the model sizes, two more models were set up by combining thermoplastic and thermoelastic solid elements with thermoelastic shells: constant (model III) and varying aspect ratio (model IV). As expected, these four models presented equivalent results as far as the calculation of the thermally induced temperatures, displacements and stresses was concerned however, severe differences in computational efficiency were observed. The aim of this paper is to quantitatively present the benefits encountered from the combination of solids with shells in thermal and thermal stress analyses and to discuss the computational efficiency increase that was observed as a result of this element scheme. Important numerical issues like position of the solid to shell transition area, coupling of solids and shells, and aspect ratio of the elements, which affected the overall efficiency, are also discussed. As a result, increase in computational efficiency was observed when solid elements were combined with shells of varying aspect ratio, the latter modeling the far field area of the weld. This combination proved to be very beneficial in computational welding mechanics and is expected to facilitate the simulation of thermal and thermal stress analyses of large scale welded structures using the finite element method. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
ISQVSGZB,10.1016/j.petrol.2019.106732,Constrained clustering approaches to identify hydraulic flow units in petroleum reservoirs,"Hydraulic flow units (HFUs) are recognized as volumetric regions that favor the flow of reservoir fluids. Their determination is made possible through correlations between data that are transferred from miscroscale to reservoir scale by upscaling. However, the strong dependence on microscale parameters inherited by commonplace analytical methods based on flow indicators is still less tractable to achieve models having uniform continuity of HFUs at reservoir scale. This paper is intended to propose a class of partitioning algorithms to deal with the problem of identifying hydraulic flow units in petroleum reservoirs. As a result, a novel viewpoint inspired on constrained clusterwise linear regression is presented to describe the identification problem. We have studied the micro-to-macroscale correspondence through a mathematical isomorphism that maps the sample domain onto the reservoir domain by using the so called flow zone indicator (FZI) as underlying parameter. Each HFU is theoretically identified by a partition of FZI points that must lie on a straight line of unitary slope in a log?€?log plot of two quantities: porosity and reservoir quality index (RQI). By setting up constrained clustering approaches with different must-link hard constraints, we have found multiple HFUs directly from the dataset without resorting to usual conversion formulae. Pros and cons of each approach are discussed from analyses performed over the UNISIM-I-D dataset (a reservoir model for the Namorado oilfield, Campos Basin, Brazil), as with their feasibility to devise new data-driven workflows turned to reservoir modeling and characterization, especially at the interest of exploration and production oil industry upstream. Besides, a short overall comparison by taking a correlative flow zone indicator (namely, FZI*) as underlying parameter is appended to the text. We point out that an existent tradeoff between analytical and physical requirements is a limiting factor to properly identify hydraulic flow units at reservoir scale regardless the flow indicator. In particular, it turns out that algorithms that find highly correlated partitions indicate HFUs that lack of uniform continuity and are less physically meaningful. Oppositely, algorithms that produce less correlated partitions determine HFUs with satisfactory local continuity and compactness, being more physically acceptable. Additionally, we show that a inter-clustering process is recommended when selecting data points associated to representative volumes and local spots characterizing HFUs. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

Considerable concern relates to their reported xenoestrogenicity and consequently, microbial-based attenuation of environmental PE concentrations is of interest to combat harmful downstream effects. Fungal PE catabolism has received less attention than that by bacteria, and particularly fungi dwelling within aquatic environments remain largely overlooked in this respect. We have compared the biocatalytic and biosorptive removal rates of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP), chosen to represent two environmentally prominent PEs of differing structure and hydrophobicity, by marine-, freshwater-, and terrestrial-derived fungal strains. Bisphenol A, both an extensively used plastic additive and prominent environmental xenoestrogen, was included as a reference compound due to its well-documented fungal degradation. Partial pathways of DBP metabolization by the ecophysiologically diverse asco- and basidiomycete strains tested were proposed with the help of UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis. Species specific biochemical reaction steps contributing to DBP metabolism were also observed. The involved reactions include initial cytochrome P450-dependent monohydroxylations of DBP with subsequent further oxidation of related metabolites, de-esterification via either hydrolytic cleavage or cytochrome P450-dependent oxidative O-dealkylation, transesterification, and demethylation steps - finally yielding phthalic acid as a central intermediate in all pathways. Due to the involvement of ecophysiologically and phylogenetically diverse filamentous and yeast-like fungi native to marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats the results of this study outline an environmentally ubiquitous pathway for the biocatalytic breakdown of plastic additives. Beyond previous research into fungal PE metabolism which emphasizes hydrolytic de-esterification as the primary catabolic step, a prominent role of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-catalyzed reactions is established. ??

This study is the first to describe how aquatic animals interact with this type of microplastic, and the resultant physiological responses. We analysed ?€?regular foam?€? microplastics generated from petroleum-derived phenol-formaldehyde plastic, and ?€?biofoam?€? microplastics generated from plant-derived phenol-formaldehyde plastic. Regular foam and biofoam microplastics showed similar FTIR spectra. Both types of microplastics were consumed by all six invertebrate species tested: the freshwater gastropod Physa acuta, the marine gastropod Bembicium nanum, the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis, adults and neonates of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, the marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa, and nauplii of the marine crustacean Artemia sp. For all species, the occurrence of ingestion was similar for regular foam and biofoam microplastics. Biofoam microplastics leached more than twice as much phenolic compounds than regular foam microplastics. The leachates from regular foam and biofoam microplastics showed the same acute toxicity to Artemia nauplii (24-h LC50 = 27.4 mg mL??? 1 and 22.8 mg mL??? 1, respectively) and D. magna (48-h LC50 = 17.8 mg mL??? 1 and 15.3 mg mL??? 1, respectively). However, biofoam microplastic leachate was twice as toxic to embryos of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, compared with leachate from regular foam microplastic (96-h LC50 = 43.8 mg mL??? 1 vs 27.1 mg mL??? 1). Using M. galloprovincialis, we show that regular foam microplastic leachate and the physical presence of the microplastics exerted separate and cumulative effects on catalase (CAT) activity, glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activity and lipid peroxidation. Microplastic ingestion did not affect the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE).

Due to the limited of data available regarding MPs pollution in Indonesian waters, we investigated the occurrence, spatial distribution, characteristics, and potential ecological impacts of MPs in sediments from 25 stations in the Banten Bay, a shallow and semi enclosed bay located on the northwestern coast of Java, Indonesia. The bay has experienced very high population pressure due to increasing coastal development in the last decade. MPs were extracted by flotation methods, observed under a stereomicroscope, and identified by FTIR imaging. This study showed that MPs pollution is prevalent in the Banten Bay, where all sediments contained MPs with an average concentration of 267 ?? 98 particles/kg dw sediment. The most common shape, size, and polymer type were foam (38% of the observed MPs), size between 500 and 1000 ??m (>50%), and extended polystyrene, respectively. The particles were found to be more highly distributed in the stations with fine sediment grain sizes and in locations near the river mouth of the island than in areas offshore, which suggests that the impact of the MPs currently in the sediments might be harmful to the benthic community and potentially increase the magnitude into the pelagic community.

All MPs were rapidly colonized by the microbial community within 2 weeks of incubation, when approximately 1010 16S rRNA gene copies cm??? 2 were detected on PVC, 109 copies cm??? 2 on PE, and 108 copies cm???2 on PET, PP and PS. A greater biofilm growth on PVC pellets than other MPs was confirmed by quantification of the reducing sugars of the EPS and biofilm staining with crystal violet. Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) revealed that the biofilm community on MPs significantly differed from the sediment community, being enriched of chemoorganotrophic fermenting species, and was significantly affected by the type of polymer. The presence of sorbed PCBs did not significantly affect the overall community composition, and mainly resulted in the enrichment of Dehalococcoidia, i.e., of the organohalide respiring members of the community. Reductive dechlorination of PCBs sorbed to MPs was observed after 2 weeks of incubation, when the average number of chlorines per biphenyl molecule was reduced from 5.2 to 4.8?€?4.3, and was faster (35.2 ?? 1.9 to 61.2 ?? 5.8 ??mol of Cl removed kgMP ??? 1 week??? 1) than that of sediment-sorbed ones (33.9 ?? 9.1 ??mol of Cl removed kgsediment ??? 1 week??? 1), which started only after 10 weeks of incubation.

CN57UTTE,10.1021/acsomega.9b03278,Effect of Agitation Method on the Nanosized Degradation of Polystyrene Microplastics Dispersed in Water,"Reports of marine organisms ingesting microplastics - formed from large plastic litter drifting in the marine environment by mechanical forces such as waves and photochemical processes initiated by sunlight, particularly ultraviolet rays - are increasing. However, the degradation process from microplastics to nanoplastics that are easily consumed by plankton located in the lower part of the food chain is not clear. Therefore, 200 nm diameter polystyrene (PS) latex particles - nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) calibration particles - dispersed in ultrapure deionized water were subjected to three types of agitation: rotation mixing, shaking, and flowing in addition to standing without agitation, and the physical degradation caused by agitation for 1 week at room temperature (23 ??C) was evaluated. The degradation of the particles into nanosized particles was assessed by particle size distribution measurement using NTA and shape observation using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). In addition, the ratio of particle aggregation during incubation was calculated from the number of particles present in the region exceeding the particle size distribution range of the monodisperse particles before agitation with respect to the total number of particles. A shape change to a particle size of 100 nm or less was observed for the rotating and flowing of samples, and the influence of aggregation was suppressed to within 21% of the total particles calculated by NTA at the maximum. These results show that chemically stable PS can be degraded from micro- to nanosize with simple agitation in ultrapure deionized water. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",
L2ZSTKZM,10.1016/j.cub.2019.12.037,In Vivo Accumulation of Plastic-Derived Chemicals into Seabird Tissues,"Plastic debris is ubiquitous and increasing in the marine environment [1]. A wide range of marine organisms ingest plastic, and its impacts are of growing concern [2]. Seabirds are particularly susceptible to plastic pollution because of high rates of ingestion [3]. Because marine plastics contain an array of hazardous compounds, the chemical impacts of ingestion are concerning. Several studies on wild seabirds suggested accumulation of plastic-derived chemicals in seabird tissues [4?€?7]. However, to date, the evidence has all been indirect [4?€?7], and it is unclear whether plastic debris is the source of these pollutants. To obtain direct evidence for the transfer and accumulation of plastic additives in the tissues of seabirds, we conducted an in vivo plastic feeding experiment. Environmentally relevant exposure of plastics compounded with one flame retardant and four ultraviolet stabilizers to streaked shearwater (Calonectris leucomelas) chicks in semi-field conditions resulted in the accumulation of the additives in liver and adipose fat of 91 to 120,000 times the rate from the natural diet. Additional monitoring of six seabird species detected these chemical additives only in those species with high plastic ingestion rates, suggesting that plastic debris can be a major pathway of chemical pollutants into seabirds. These findings provide direct evidence of seabird exposure to plastic additives and emphasize the role of marine debris ingestion as a source of chemical pollution in marine organisms. Tanaka et al. show that feeding additive-laced plastic pellets to seabirds results in the accumulation of chemical additives in liver and adipose tissue at 101?€?105 times above baseline. These findings demonstrate seabird exposure to plastic additives and additives?€? importance as emerging pollution sources. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Awareness of the potential damage to the world's oceans has grown but there is less attention given to freshwater ecosystems. Yet, rivers are the dominant source of plastic pollution to the marine environment, as well as a potential sink, accumulating plastic from multiple sources. Actions to reduce the presence of macroplastics in rivers is fundamental to conserving both freshwater and marine environments, but there is limited understanding of potential pollution sources, vectors and storage. Importantly, there are only a handful of studies examining the typologies of freshwater macroplastic pollution, often using different categories and collection methods. This impedes setting priorities for scientific investigation and mitigation measures. The present study identifies the most prevalent macroplastic items in freshwater environments in Europe, with a focus on consumer plastic items, i.e. those that could potentially be reduced by targeted actions by the public, as well as industrial and government intervention. Our analysis addresses the differences between reported macroplastics in freshwater and marine environments as well as those estimated from litter rates. Our results identify a macroplastic ?€?top ten?€?, i.e. those dominant plastic typologies that require a more focused effort to reformulate their use and management, as well as setting a common baseline for a more consistent data gathering and reporting approach. ?? 2019 The Author(s)",

Stormwater runoff has been identified as one of the main pollutant contributors to water bodies. Seven sites were sampled to identify and quantify microplastics in stormwater runoff in Tijuana, Mexico. The median microplastic abundance found in the samples was between 66 and 191 particles L???1, the highest abundance being recorded in an industrial land use site. The estimated annual total microplastic loads were between 8 ?? 105 and 3 ?? 106 particles ha???1. The most abundant microplastic shape and identified polymer type were fibers and polyethylene, respectively. The highest microplastic abundances were observed in events with higher rainfall. The results have shown that stormwater runoff is an important source of microplastic to water bodies. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

The existing research on SSC columns confined with FRP jackets, however, is rather limited. Most of the limited research has focused on the axial compressive behavior of SSC columns confined by conventional FRP jackets (made from carbon and glass FRP composites). This paper presents results from the first-ever experimental study on the behavior of axially loaded circular SSC columns confined by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) FRP jackets, which are composed of a new and more promising type of FRP composites with a bilinear stress-strain response and a large rupture strain. Parameters varied between the tests presented in this paper included the type and thickness of FRP jackets and the type of mixing water used for casting the SSC. A modified analysis-oriented model was developed in which a new dilation equation was proposed for the PET FRP-confined SSC. The reliability and accuracy of the analysis-oriented model were then examined by comparisons between the predicted results and the test results of the FRP-confined SSC. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

The cover thicknesses were set as 10 mm and 20 mm, the immersion temperatures were room temperature (???28 ??C), 40 ??C, and 60 ??C, and the immersion media were an alkaline solution and distilled water. A set of bare glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars was used for comparison. After one year, the mechanical properties of the bare BFRP bars immersed in a 60 ??C alkaline solution deteriorated the most, and the tensile strength decreased from 954.2 MPa to 762.3, 594.7, and 515.5 MPa for the bare BFRP bars and the 10 mm and 20 mm cement mortar-covered specimens immersed in distilled water at room temperature, respectively. The results indicated that alkalinity is a key factor causing the degradation of BFRP and that deterioration is more evident in large-sized cement mortar. In addition, an alkali?€?aggregate reaction (AAR) of SiO2 in the basalt fibre was evidenced by the presence of a white gel at the interface between the BFRP bars and cement mortar. Thus, AAR is detrimental to the mechanical properties of the cement mortar-covered BFRP specimens in the initial stage. With an increase in immersion time, the cement mortar layer exhibited a protective effect, particularly for the small-sized cement mortar-covered specimens. The BFRP bars are more durable than the GFRP bars owing to the higher fibre volume fraction of GFRP. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
H77LHDLZ,10.1021/acs.est.9b04850,"Underestimated Microplastic Pollution Derived from Fishery Activities and ""Hidden"" in Deep Sediment","Fishery activities are an important source of microplastic pollution in coastal areas but have received little attention. The Beibu Gulf, a traditional fishing ground of China and the China-Indo Peninsula, was selected in this study, and the focus was on the impacts of fishery activities on the horizontal distribution of microplastics in sediment. The results showed that the dominant contaminants (polypropylene fibers and polyethylene fibers) might originate from the abrasion of fishing gear and contributed to 61.6% of the total abundance of microplastics in surface sediment. The abundance of polypropylene fibers and polyethylene fibers exhibited a strong correlation (R2 = 0.8586, p = 0.015) with values of fishery yields of different districts, which highlighted the effects of different fishery activities on microplastic contamination in marine sediment. Microplastics could be ""hidden"" in deep sediment to a depth of 60 cm. The estimated storage of microplastics in deep sediment (185 tons) was 5 times that in surface sediment. The assessment of microplastic storage worldwide might be underestimated because most previous studies only examined surface sediment. The abundance distribution and size distribution of microplastics in the sediment core suggested long-term burial of microplastics in deep sediment. Bioturbation might be responsible for the vertical transport of microplastics, leading to ""fresh microplastics"" preservation in ""old sediment"". ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",
LF3H98JJ,10.1021/acs.est.9b05228,Plasticizer Degradation by Marine Bacterial Isolates: A Proteogenomic and Metabolomic Characterization,"Many commercial plasticizers are toxic endocrine-disrupting chemicals that are added to plastics during manufacturing and may leach out once they reach the environment. Traditional phthalic acid ester plasticizers (PAEs), such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and bis(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), are now increasingly being replaced with more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC). While the metabolic pathways for PAE degradation have been established in the terrestrial environment, to our knowledge, the mechanisms for ATBC biodegradation have not been identified previously and plasticizer degradation in the marine environment remains underexplored. From marine plastic debris, we enriched and isolated microbes able to grow using a range of plasticizers and, for the first time, identified the pathways used by two phylogenetically distinct bacteria to degrade three different plasticizers (i.e., DBP, DEHP, and ATBC) via a comprehensive proteogenomic and metabolomic approach. This integrated multi-OMIC study also revealed the different mechanisms used for ester side-chain removal from the different plasticizers (esterases and enzymes involved in the ??-oxidation pathway) as well as the molecular response to deal with toxic intermediates, that is, phthalate, and the lower biodegrading potential detected for ATBC than for PAE plasticizers. This study highlights the metabolic potential that exists in the biofilms that colonize plastics - the Plastisphere - to effectively biodegrade plastic additives and flags the inherent importance of microbes in reducing plastic toxicity in the environment. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

The global proliferation of plastic objects permeates not only the deep sea, but also our kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms and bodies. This essay examines a series of case studies crystallizing some thoughts towards a dark ecology of plastic performativity. First, I develop a theoretical framework of plastic ecologies with reference to Kelly Jazvac's (2013-19) sculptural ?€?Plastiglomerate readymades', naturally occurring mineral assemblages of melded plastic debris and geological sediment, and Pinar Yoldas's (2014) ?€?Organs of the plastisphere', speculative biological adaptions for post-human creatures to sense and digest plastic. Then, I turn to Allison Cobb's (2015) Plastic: an autobiography, a creative non-fiction text based upon a durational, research-based process of uncovering links between the writer's embodied experience and plastic's history and materiality. Acknowledging the presence of microplastic particles within her body, Cobb speaks for plastic because she is plastic: the autobiographical individual subject becomes a plural, porous subject, an assemblage of vital materialities with distributed agency. Next, I discuss Claudia Borgna's (2015) performance art piece When I breathe you breathe, when you breathe I breathe, in which the artist breathes into a plastic bag. Borgna?€?s work explores ambivalent human affects towards plastic and subverts the common-sense assumption that plastic is toxic to humans by linking plastic with the breath, with what we need to survive. Finally, I theorize plastic subjectivity, suggesting that microplastics and nanoplastics activate a queer form of biological performativity. An ecological awareness of our bodies becoming-plastic may allow us to relinquish our illusions of individual sovereignty, and let ourselves slip into the ebb and flow of the sea of actants within us. ?? 2020, ?? 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

In this study, pH-sensitive poly(2-diisopropylaminoethyl methacrylate)-b-poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PDPA-b-PMPC) and cationic polylysine (PLYS) chains are grafted on tannic acid (TA). The resulting PLYS-TA-PDPA-b-PMPC can be anchored in ""one-step"", via coordination chelation of TA, on substrate surfaces to impart the latter with switchable antimicrobial and antifouling functionalities. The PLYS-TA-PDPA-b-PMPC functionalized stainless steel (SS) surface exhibits significant antimicrobial (S. epidermidis and E. coli) activity as well as resistance to protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and microalgal (Amphora coffeaeformis) attachment. The reversible transition between antimicrobial and antifouling effects is achieved in response to pH changes of the surrounding environment. Decrease in pH arising from bacterial adhesion/deposition switches the antimicrobial polymer brush coatings to the antifouling mode with ""self-defensive"" (fouling-release/self-cleaning) capability. The functional polymer coatings exhibit low cytotoxicity. They are sustainable over 30 days of stationary exposure to filtered seawater or 14 days under flowing seawater. Therefore, the switchable antimicrobial/antifouling polymer brush coatings, with environmentally benign TA anchor and environmentally responsive fouling-release ability, are potentially useful for biofouling inhibition in biomedical and marine environments.

Several lab studies demonstrated adverse effects induced by exposure to different MP polymers toward diverse marine species. However, the information regarding toxicity of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs is largely unknown. The present study was aimed at investigating the adverse effects induced by 7-day exposure to two concentrations (0.125 or 12.5 ??g/ml) micronized, irregular shaped and variable size PET microparticles (PET-MPs) toward Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum). Histological analyses were performed to assess tissue damage on digestive glands, gonads, gut and gills, whereas oxidative stress-related effects, including the concentration of pro-oxidant molecules, activity of antioxidant (superoxide dismutase?€?SOD, catalase?€?CAT and glutathione peroxidase?€?GPx) and detoxifying (glutathione S-transferase?€?GST) enzymes, as well as levels of lipid peroxidation, were determined in gills and digestive gland. Our results showed that clams ingest and egest micronized PET-MPs, but no marked histological alterations to bivalve tissues occurred. Although PET-MPs did not produce oxidative stress in the digestive gland, these materials significantly altered oxidative status of gills, leading to lipid peroxidation. No apparent clear indication of a weakness of bivalve health status was obtained in this study. ?? 2020, ?? 2020 Taylor & Francis.",

This study focused on a multi-step approach for microplastic analysis combining grain size fractionation, density separation and identification by ??-FTIR-spectroscopy. Eight widely used polymers (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polystyrol (PS), polyethylenterephthalate (PET), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyurethane (PU) and polyamide (PA)) were fractionated into four groups of grain sizes (0.1-5 mm). Thereafter, sea sand was spiked with these particles to test a ZnCl2-based density separation for the polymer types and the various grain sizes. The obtained recovery rates were close to 100% showing that ZnCl2-based density separation is suitable to separate the polymer particles from a sandy matrix. This approach was extended on three further environmental matrices and recovery rates for two of them (sandy-silty and fine-grained sediment) also provided reliable values (94-106%). Lastly, the developed multi-step approach was verified by analyzing an environmental sample (sediment from river Tiran??, Albania) characterized by smaller grain size and moderate organic matter content. Identification of two polymer types in different grain size classes verified the suitability of the developed approach for microplastic analyses on particulate matter such as soils and sediments. ?? 2020 IWA Publishing.

The effect of operating conditions on gasification was investigated. Inspired by marine microplastics, the artificial seawater was provided to gasification. A detailed gasification model of PET microplastics was established to reveal the gasification path. The results showed that the increase in gasification temperature and time improved gasification efficiency, but the increase in reaction pressure had little effect on the characteristics of the supercritical water so that gasification efficiency did not change significantly. The carbon conversion of 98.00 wt% was obtained at 800 ??C for 10 min. The metal salts contained in seawater promoted the gasification of plastics, which meant that seawater was an efficient utilization route to the plastic gasification.

After one year, the mechanical properties of the uncovered BFRP immersed in 60 ??C simulated seawater showed the most degradation, followed by the concrete-covered BFRP in the laboratory immersion. Concrete-covered BFRP showed more deterioration than uncovered BFRP in the ocean water. The results indicated that the alkalinity is the key factor causing the degradation of BFRP, especially for standing water in the laboratory environment. In addition, an alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR) of SiO2 in basalt fiber was found at the interface between the BFRP bars and concrete. The degradation of the resin matrix and sizing led to the direct exposure of basalt fiber to alkaline solution, which established the foundation of the AAR. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Three-way ANOVA analysis reveals that all parameters, including polymerization time, UV irradiation time, and temperature are significant. The results show that by lowering the temperature below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAAm, the microorganisms wholly detached from the surface.

In this paper, impacts of carbon fibre/epoxy composite specimens with solid (steel) and fragmenting (ice) spherical projectiles are studied extensively, using a combination of non-invasive analysis techniques to assess their dynamic deformation behaviour and resultant damage. The velocity magnitudes of high-intensity impacts varied between 70 and 90 m/s for solid projectiles and between 300 and 500 m/s for fragmenting ones, resulting in three consistent and comparable levels of structural damage for both cases. A new in-depth deformation analysis method based on high-speed digital image correlation was utilised to assess the effect of both the projectile type and impact velocity, resulting in a deeper understanding of the specimen's deformation behaviour allowing detailed observation of its stages during the impact event.

Compressive and flexural strength were measured to determine the optimum mix proportion of the composites. The sulfate resistance properties were evaluated by strength loss, mass loss, microstructure and pore structure changes after sulfate exposure. The experimental results show that the two groups containing 1% of PP + 1% of PVA and 2% of PVA +15% of WS, respectively, exhibit the highest compressive strength and flexural strength compared to non-reinforced mixtures. After sulfate exposure, the decreased compressive strength and mass loss are correlated to the concentration of sulfate and exposure period. In the simulated extreme marine environment, the deterioration of composites induced by high concentration of sulfate after 28 days of exposure reaches to the maximum level or a threshold. The average pore size and porosity increase after the sulfate exposure. The role of fibers in mechanical properties and microstructure after sulfate exposure were also investigated.

Apart from the importance of reducing the amount of plastic entering the ocean, clearing the rivers from debris is important for societal concerns, such as flood risks. Plastic waste accumulation at trash racks leads to a rise in upstream water level and may increase urban flood risk. Until now, most studies of riverine debris accumulation predominantly focused on organic accumulations at trash racks and bridge piers. In this study, flume experiments were used to study the behavior of plastic and mixed debris accumulations. One of the key findings from this study is that plastic debris causes a faster blockage than organic matter, as the plastic blockage contains fewer voids and therefore has a higher blockage density. In addition to the flume experiments, field measurements were performed in the Cikapundung River (Indonesia). This river is one of the tributaries of the Citarum River, which is considered one of the world?€?s most heavily polluted rivers. Combining the results of the flume experiments and field measurements demonstrated that a backwater rise of 1 m/h is plausible for a blocked trash rack in the Cikapundung River, illustrating the additional flood risk caused by plastic pollution. Our results emphasize the need for further quantifying riverine (plastic) debris and investigating its relation to changes in the water system behavior, including its influence on urban flood risk. ??

Polyethylene (PE; 38.46%) followed by cellulose (CE; 23.08%), rayon (RY; 15.38%), polyester (PL; 15.38%) and polypropylene (PP; 7.69%) were the major contributors in the fish ingested microplastic composition. A broad range of heavy metals, metalloids and other elements that are potentially indicative of hazardous chemicals were present in microplastics collected from the beaches of Kerala. These results enhance our understanding on the sources, transport pathways and the associated environmental risks of microplastics to marine ecosystems. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",
9EFKMASR,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135024,Bacterial interactions of microplastics extracted from toothpaste under controlled conditions and the influence of seawater,"Microplastics have become a global concern due to their increasing use and discharge into the environment. These ubiquitous particles are known to have extremely low degradation rates and accumulate mostly in the marine environment. The evidence for bioaccumulation and indicators of stress linked to microplastics is also stated in the literature. However, the real environmental impact of microplastics has not yet been revealed. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the interaction mechanisms between microplastics and (micro)organisms under controlled (standard) laboratory conditions and environmentally relevant conditions to reflect the true environmental -situation. In this study, we aimed to understand how microplastics extracted from commercially available toothpaste samples interacted with four types of bacteria under both standard and seawater conditions. For this purpose, bacterial inhibitions were examined, and mechanisms of inhibition were evaluated by biochemical parameters (total protein, lipid peroxidase, total antioxidant capacity, and extracellular carbohydrate levels) of bacteria and physicochemical properties (zeta potential, particle size, surface chemistry) of microplastics. Results showed that gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa were affected in controlled and sea water media, respectively. The inhibition of the bacteria relied on the high zeta potentials of the microplastics, and, biochemically, protein and lipid peroxidase activity of bacteria were important in both media. On the other hand, while biochemical responses were similar in both media, the difference between the cell wall and microplastics surface charge was important only in seawater. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

Effluent waters from secondary wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) into Todos Santos Bay (TSB) were investigated as sources of MPs. MPs were detected in all analyzed matrices and presented variable morphologies. MPs from surface water samples (n = 18) varied from 0.01 to 0.70 plastic particles/m3 (pp/m3). Fragments (47 ?? 23%) and fibers (47 ?? 23%) were the most abundant particles found in the surface water samples. In sediment samples (n = 11), MPs varied from 85 to 2494 pp/0.1 m2. Sediment samples showed fragments of 70 ?? 19%, fibers 28 ?? 18% in mean. The range of MP values from WWTP effluents (n = 24) was 81 to 1556 pp/m3, and fibers (65 ?? 28%) were the most abundant MP particles. Several synthetic polymers (polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene-propylene, polyvinyl chloride, cellophane), and natural fibers (cotton and wood) were identified. The surface currents and the parameters that modulate them, are the main factors that dominate the distribution of MPs in surface waters. While in the sediments the parameters such as bathymetry and grain size distribution have more influence on their distribution in the marine environment, where the effluent waters from WWTPs only contributes MPs to the TSB. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

For this, the biopolymers were dissolved in a trifluoroacetic acid-trifluoroacetic anhydride mixture and blended in different percentages, simulating those found in natural woods. Free-standing and flexible films were obtained after the complete evaporation of the solvents. By varying xylan and hydrolyzed lignin contents, the physical properties were easily tuned. In particular, higher proportions of hydrolyzed lignin improved hydrodynamics, oxygen barrier, grease resistance, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties, whereas a higher xylan content was related to more ductile mechanical behavior, comparable to synthetic and bio-based polymers commonly used for packaging applications. In addition, these bioplastics showed high biodegradation rates in seawater. Such new polymeric materials are presented as alternatives to common man-made petroleum-based plastics used for food packaging. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

Here, the processing, physical properties and marine AF performance of a fluorinated coating based on a thermoplastic (non-crosslinked) fluorinated polymer are reported. It was found that the addition of lubricating oil and hydrodynamic drag reducing microstructures improved the AF properties substantially, i.e. the settlement of a marine biofilm, containing mixed microalgae including diatoms, was reduced to low levels. More importantly, the remaining fouling was removed from the coatings at low hydrodynamic shear rates and promising AF properties were obtained.

In the present study, an antifouling (AF) coating was developed by adding a non-toxic AF compound (butenolide) to a bio-based and biodegradable poly(lactic acid)-based polyurethane. Mass loss measurement showed that the polymer degraded in seawater at a rate of 0.013mg cm???2day???1. Measurements showed that butenolide was released from the coatings into seawater over a period of at least three months. Both the concentration of butenolide in the coatings and the ambient temperature determined the release rate of butenolide. The results further demonstrate that incorporating rosin into the coatings increase the self-renewal rate of the polymer and facilitated the long-term release of butenolide from the coating. The results show that poly(lactic acid)-based polyurethane is a suitable polymer for butenolide-based AF coatings. ?? 2020, ?? 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

To create an experience that could be playful enough to attract and engage people, while still subtly conveying a serious message, we chose the game of hopscotch as a backdrop for a playful experience, revealing at each step the journey a plastic bottle goes through during its lifecycle. Accordingly, we named the work Rayuela, which is the Spanish word for hopscotch. We built Rayuela as a modular system consisting of 11 light boxes, each telling a different fact about the plastic bottle's journey. Each time people jumped on a box, it turned the next one on, thus progressively revealing the story. As the work was designed for exhibition in a very large public festival lasting about a month, design considerations ranged form aesthetic and interactive aspects to robustness and reliability. In this paper, we describe the conceptual rationale for Rayuela, its design and building process, and the methods for automated data gathering we implemented. We then present the results of the field study, and discuss preliminary findings, as well as implications for future design. ?? 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",

These relationships can vary among species and environments, allowing organisms to acclimatize to their local thermal regime. This study quantified the seasonal variation in the thermal performance of several coral and symbiont-dominated physiological traits for the thermally tolerant coral species Porites cylindrica and the thermally sensitive coral species Acropora valenciennesi. Photosynthesis rates, respiration rates, maximum photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield and electron transport rates were measured in winter and summer on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and decrease up to 5??C above and below the average seawater temperature in each season. Results showed that colonies of A. valenciennesi acclimated primarily by shifting their optimal temperature to a higher temperature in summer, whereas colonies of P. cylindrica had broader thermal breadth during summer. For symbionts within both species, performance was higher at all temperatures in summer, while the thermal optima and performance breadth remained unchanged. Despite these changes in thermal performance, the thermal optima of most traits did not match the ambient environmental temperature, but fell between the summer and winter temperatures. Overall, these results showed that both coral species were physiologically plastic in response to temperature change, but that there are constraints on the rate or capacity for acclimation that prevent a perfect match between the average temperature of the environment and the thermal optimum of the species. ??

The fate of the missing plastic and its impact on marine life remains largely unknown. To address these unknowns, we irradiated post-consumer microplastics (polyethylene, PE; polypropylene, PP; and expanded polystyrene, EPS), standard PE, and plastic-fragments collected from the surface waters of the North Pacific Gyre under a solar simulator. We report that simulated sunlight can remove plastics from the sea surface. Simulated sunlight also fragmented, oxidized, and altered the color of the irradiated polymers. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is identified as a major byproduct of sunlight-driven plastic photodegradation. Rates of removal depended upon polymer chemistry with EPS degrading more rapidly than PP, and PE being the most photo-resistant polymer studied. The DOC released as most plastics photodegraded was readily utilized by marine bacteria. However, one sample of PE microplastics released organics or co-leachates that inhibited microbial growth. Thus, although sunlight may remove plastics from the ocean's surface, leachates formed during plastic photodegradation may have mixed impacts on ocean microbes and the food webs they support. ?? 2019 The Authors",

This study therefore investigated the occurrence, abundance and distribution of micro-, meso- and macro-plastic debris along shores and sediment of northern Lake Victoria. The abundance of micro-, meso- and macro-plastics measured as particles/kg dry sediment were in range of 0?€?1102, 0?€?218 and 0?€?100 respectively in shoreline sediment and 0?€?108, 0?€?33 and 0?€?77 respectively in lake sediment. The mean abundance of micro-, meso- and macro-plastic debris at fish landing beaches (75.2 ?? 50.0, 16.7 ?? 8.1 and 18.1 ?? 4.6 respectively) were higher than what was recorded at recreational beaches (1.5 ?? 0.6, 3.1 ?? 3.1 and 3.8 ?? 3.8 respectively).

Films, filaments, fragments, foam and pellets were the plastic types, with the shoreline sediment dominated by films (>54%) while lake sediment was dominated by filaments (>55%), across size groups (micro-, meso- and macro-plastics). Spearman's rank correlation indicated strong and significant correlation between abundance of micro- and meso-plastics for total plastic, film plastic and fragment plastic in shoreline sediment. Significant correlation between macroplastics in shoreline sediment and microplastics in lake sediment for total plastics was observed. The FTIR analysis revealed that polyethylene, polypropylene, Polyethylene Terephthalate, Polyamide (nylon), and polyvinyl chloride were the major polymers.

Concentrations of microplastics (&lt;5 mm) ranged from 0 to 213 particles/kg dry weight sediment with higher values in sites directly under the influence of the fish farms. Most particles (27.8%) were within the size fraction from 1.1 to 2.0 mm and fibre was the most common shape with 62.2%.

Under the effect of several abiotic factors, macro plastic wastes (or plastic wastes with macro sizes) are fractionated into microplastics (MP) and finally reach the nanometric size (nanoplastic NP). To reveal potential toxic impacts of these NPs, two microalgae, Scenedemus subspicatus (freshwater green algae), and Thalassiosira weissiflogii (marine diatom) were exposed for up to 48 h at 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 ??g/L to reference polyethylene NPs (PER) or NPs made from polyethylene collected in the North Atlantic gyre (PEN, 7th continent expedition in 2015). Freshwater filter-feeding bivalves, Corbicula fluminea, were exposed to 1000 ??g/L of PER and PEN for 48 h to study a possible modification of their filtration or digestion capacity. The results show that PER and PEN do not influence the cell growth of T. weissiflogii, but the PEN exposure causes growth inhibition of S. subspicatus for all exposure concentrations tested. This growth inhibition is enhanced for a higher concentration of PER or PEN (10,000 ??g/L) in S. subspicatus. The marine diatom T. weissiflogii appears to be less impacted by plastic pollution than the green algae S. subspicatus for the exposure time.

The results showed no difference in emergence likelihood or emergence latency related to microplastic abundance, sex, or treatment. However, L. littorea size did have a significant effect on emergence likelihood and emergence latency, with smaller individuals emerging faster and more frequently. This study shows that microplastics, at their current environmental levels, do not seem to affect L. littorea emergence behaviour. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

The results show that as compared to high tide, a significantly higher number and quantity of marine debris, mainly consisting of plastics, flows towards the sea during low tide conditions. A higher magnitude (both number and weight) of the debris was transported to sea at tidal height <2 m compared to >2m. It is evident from the findings that the water channel traversing through the thickly populated catchment areas transport a considerable quantity of marine debris consisting of a substantial quantity of plastics to the sea. The quantity of microplastic was negligible (1-2g/Kg debris), indicating that water channels connected to the sea mostly transport macro- and mega plastic, which may disintegrate to form microplastic in due course of time. ?? 2020",

The study was conducted by collecting samples from the sea surface area, at 50 cm and 170 cm depths, while seawater and sediments were collected from six stations. The results showed an early stage of degradation because of abiotic factors. The surface morphology of plastic changed, indicating the disorientation of the plastic. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that organic carbon decreased by 3.15%, 6.67%, and 16.76% for the PP applied on surface water, at 50 cm depth and at 170 cm depth, respectively. From six stations, PP microplastic was the dominant type, where microplastic in sediment was bio-fouled fiber ranging in size from 255.23 to 1245.71 ??m; however, in seawater, it was 7?€?111 particles/10 mL and ranged from 270.27 to 1279.12 ??m in size. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
BGX9XM5S,10.1029/2019JC015583,Influence of Barotropic Tidal Currents on Transport and Accumulation of Floating Microplastics in the Global Open Ocean,"Floating plastic debris is an increasing source of pollution in the world's oceans. Numerical simulations using models of ocean currents give insight into the transport and distribution of microplastics in the oceans, but most simulations do not account for the oscillating flow caused by global barotropic tides. Here, we investigate the influence of barotropic tidal currents on the transport and accumulation of floating microplastics, by numerically simulating the advection of virtual plastic particles released all over the world's oceans and tracking these for 13 years. We use geostrophic and surface Ekman currents from GlobCurrent and the currents caused by the four main tidal constituents (M (Formula presented.), S (Formula presented.), K (Formula presented.), and O (Formula presented.)) from the FES model. We analyze the differences between the simulations with and without the barotropic tidal currents included, focusing on the open ocean. In each of the simulations, we see that microplastic accumulates in regions in the subtropical gyres, which is in agreement with observations. The formation and location of these accumulation regions remain unaffected by the barotropic tidal currents. However, there are a number of coastal regions where we see differences when the barotropic tidal currents are included. Due to uncertainties of the model in coastal regions, further investigation is required in order to draw conclusions in these areas. Our results suggest that, in the global open ocean, barotropic tidal currents have little impact on the transport and accumulation of floating microplastic and can thus be neglected in simulations aimed at studying microplastic transport in the open ocean. ?? 2020.

This study investigated the microplastic presence of estuarine and barrier island beaches in the states of Virginia and North Carolina, USA. Seventeen sediment cores were collected at four study sites and initially tested for microplastic presence by pyrolysis-gas chromatography?€?mass spectrometry. For the extraction, microplastic particles were first separated from the sediment using a high-density cesium chloride solution (1.88 g/mL). In a second step, an oil extraction collected the remaining microplastic particles of higher densities. Under the light microscope, the extracted microplastic particles were classified based on their morphologies into fragments and fibers. Raman microspectroscopy chemically identified a subset of microplastic particles as polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, poly(4-vinylbiphenyl), polystyrene, polyethylene, and nylon. The results show a concentration of microplastic particles (1410 ?? 810 per kg of dry sediment) even in protected and ostensibly unpolluted estuarine and beach sediments of Virginia and North Carolina. ?? 2019",

To determine the current state of microplastic pollution on four popular sandy beaches of the coast of Lima, Peru, a sampling campaign was carried out in both intertidal and supralittoral zones. Microplastic abundance, type, size, color and distribution were recorded. The overall microplastic abundance was of the same order of magnitude as previous data obtained in Peru. Foams were the most abundant (78.3%) microplastic type. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences between sites and zones. High variability of microplastic abundance was found among adjacent beaches and zones. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed that all foams were identified as polystyrene. The present results revealed an alarming level of microplastics present on Peruvian sandy beaches, but information about the sources, local dynamics and impacts of microplastics in this region are scarce, and thus further research is needed. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

These novel plastic debris types have only recently been described for the first time from Madeira island (NE Atlantic Ocean) and the United Kingdom, respectively. While ?€?plasticrusts?€? are generated by sea waves smashing plastic debris against intertidal rocks, ?€?pyroplastic?€? derives from (un)deliberately burnt plastic waste. Using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, we identified the ?€?plasticrust?€? material as polyethylene (PE) and the ?€?pyroplastic?€? material as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). These polymers are widely used in everyday products and, therefore, contribute heavily to plastic pollution in aquatic and terrestrial environments worldwide. Furthermore, our field surveys suggest that ?€?plasticrust?€? abundance is related to wave-exposure and that the ?€?pyroplastic?€? derived from beverage bottles which we frequently found along the Giglio coast.

A novel multianalytical approach was adopted for the detection and quantification of microplastics with size &lt; 2 mm in the sediments of the volcanic lake of Bracciano, Italy. Simple analytical techniques such as solvent extraction/fractionation (for polyolefins and polystyrene) or depolymerization (for polyethylene terephthalate, PET), along with chromatographic detection (SEC and HPLC), allowed quantitative and qualitative determination of the main synthetic polymer contaminants. In particular, PET microplastic concentrations of 0.8-36 ppm were found, with variability related to the sampling site (exposure to incoming winds and wave action). Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transformed InfraRed (ATR-FTIR spectroscopic investigations supported the identification and chemical characterization of plastic fragments and polymer extracts. The average molecular weight of solvent extractable polymers was evaluated from 2D 1H-NMR diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments. The proposed, easily accessible multianalytical approach can be considered as a useful tool for improving our knowledge on the nature and the concentration of microplastics in sediments, giving insights on the impact of human activities on the health status of aquatic ecosystems. ?? 2020 by the authors.",

R6M2TXL2,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113569,Details of plastic ingestion and fibre contamination in North Sea fishes,"This study combines published datasets with unpublished data on plastic ingestion in several North Sea fish species. The combined dataset of 4389 individuals from 15 species allows the analysis of spatial distribution and temporal variability of plastic uptake in fish. Airborne fibre contamination was observed to be the main contributor to fibres encountered in the samples. The number of fibres in samples was strongly related to the time needed to process a sample, not to the number of individual fishes in the sample. Accurate correction for secondary fibre contamination was not possible, but corrections required would be similar to fibre numbers observed in the samples. Consequently, all fibres were omitted from further analysis. The frequency of occurrence and the average number of plastics in fish is generally low (1.8% and 0.022 pieces per organism respectively), with only cod having a higher prevalence (12.3%). While latitude of catch locations influences plastic uptake in fish, no correlation with the distance to the coast was found. Slightly less plastics were ingested in winter, and a decrease in plastics ingested was observed between 2009 and 2018. These factors should be considered when fish species, catch location and time are discussed as indicators for plastic pollution in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive. We recommend considering demersal cod and pelagic sprat as two species suitable for monitoring plastic ingestion in biota, both on the seafloor and in the water column. Although ingested plastic in fish from the North Sea is low, some species are suitable for monitoring programs. Fibre contamination during analysis contributes substantially to fibres found in samples. ?? 2019 The Authors",

Plastic input in coastal ponds, lagoons, river deltas and estuaries, could be driven by a wide range of human activities such as agriculture, waste disposal, municipal and industrial wastewater effluents, aquaculture, fishing and touristic activities and urban impacts. However, it remains unknown what the impact of plastic input in these TWEs could have on natural capital and, therefore, the ability for an ecosystem to provide goods and services to human beings. Given the large interest with regards to the conservation of transitional water ecosystems and the clear exposure risk to plastic and microplastic pollution, this study aims to perform: (i) a bibliometric analyses on existing literature regarding the levels of marine litter in such environments; (ii) a selection among the available literature of homogeneous data; and (iii) statistical analyses to explore data variability. Results suggest that: (i) research on microplastics in these ecosystems did not begin to be published until 2013 for lagoons, 2014 for river mouths and 2019 for coastal ponds. The majority of articles published on studies of microplastics in lagoons did not occur until 2019; (ii) sediments represent the matrix on which sampling and extraction variability allow the statistical analyses on data reported by the literature; (iii) the Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) test two-way evidenced that the level of protection of marine and terrestrial areas produced similar values while the habitat type showed low significance in terms of its effect on microplastic levels, shape and size in sediments. ?? 2020 by the authors.",
REZSF8QR,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113606,Microplastic fibers transfer from the water to the internal fluid of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus,"Microplastics (MPs) are small plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter. MPs in the form of microfibers (MFs) are widely detected in aquatic habitats and are of high environmental concern. Despite many reports on the effects of MFs on marine animals, their effect on sea cucumbers is still unclear. In addition, our previous filed study has shown that MFs may transfer to the coelomic fluid of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (A. japonicus). Here, we show how MFs transfer to the coelomic fluid of the sea cucumber. We captured the MFs during their transfer from the water to the coelomic fluid through the respiratory tree. A. japonicus ingested in the MFs along with the water during respiration; the MFs got stuck in the respiratory tree or transferred to the coelomic fluid. The transferred MFs increased during 72 h of exposure and persisted for 72 h after the transfer to clean water. Among the immunity indices, lysozyme (LZM) levels increased in response to the transferred MFs, which confirms the defensive role of LZMs against strange substances. Additionally, non-significantly decreased levels of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), malondialdehyde (MDA), peroxidase (POD) and phenol oxidase (PPO) were observed at 24 h and 48 h post-exposure, suggesting minimal oxidative imbalance. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in the speed and the total distance moved by A. japonicus post MFs transfer. This study revealed that MFs transfer and accumulate in the coelomic fluid of A. japonicus. Synthetic microfibers transfer from the water to the coelomic fluid of the sea cucumber and may increase over time. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

To identify the potential sources of PAEs in this area, seawater at different water depths and sediment were investigated. The highest level of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), which is primarily used in plastic polymers, was observed in the accumulation zone of plastic debris. Moreover, DEHP exhibited not only the highest levels in the bottom layer of water column but also a significant correlation between bottom water layer and bed sediment, which strongly suggests a continuous flow of PAEs from the seafloor to the seawater column in this area. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Oreochromis mossambicus [Peters, 1852], Terapon jarbua [Forssk??l, 1775], Ambassis dussumieri [Cuvier, 1828] and Mugil sp.), within four mangroves along the east coast of South Africa. Microplastics were isolated from whole fish using a proteinase K digestion method, and then quantified and characterised in terms of shape, chemical nature (plastic type), colour and length. Fibres (68%) and fragments (21%) were the dominant shapes found. Of the 174 fish sampled, 52% contained microplastic particles, with 0.79 ?? 1.00 particles per fish. The average number of particles per fish did not differ significantly across species within sites and across sites but was higher than in juvenile fish of other species sampled in oceanic habitats. The main plastic types collected using 10 ??m filters and identified with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), were rayon (70.4%), polyester (10.4%), nylon (5.2%) and polyvinylchloride (3.0%). Particle length ranged from 0.1 to 4.8 mm, averaging 0.89 ?? 0.77 mm, but irrespective of length, particles were mostly blue in colour. This study provides evidence that juvenile fish inhabiting mangroves are consuming significant quantities of microplastics. Importantly, it should be noted that rayon, though the most abundant plastic type found, is a semi-synthetic fibre made from regenerated cellulose that is commonly reported in studies of this nature. The habitats studied serve as nurseries for numerous fish species; however, more detailed studies are needed to assess whether microplastic ingestion could compromise the health of these fish or whether these effects are dependent on species, feeding habit and/or plastic type.

CWGXZWPY,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124855,Effects of food presence on microplastic ingestion and egestion in Mytilus galloprovincialis,"Plastic wastes are widespread pollutants in marine environments and several studies have focused on their impacts on different ecosystems. Microplastics (MPs, < 5 mm) have been the focus of a particularly extensive investigation because of their ubiquity, large surface area, interactions with organisms, and the challenges they present in terms of disposal and management. However, studies regarding their fates and life cycle in ecosystems are still limited. This study examined the effects of presence of food (the green microalga Dunaliella salina) on egestion rate of polyethylene MPs in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Ingestion and egestion rates were calculated after 6, 12, 18, and 24 h of depuration. The results suggest that MPs exposed to algal food persisted in the mussels. A single exposure of MPs without food induced relatively rapid excretion by the mussels compared to MPs exposure with food. This could be attributed to the ability of mussels to distinguish between nutritive foods and unusable suspended particles. Thus, environmental factors, such as food abundance, can affect the cycle or fate of MPs in marine environments. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

The average density of microplastics ranged from 80 to 480 particles/kg dry weight sand. There was no apparent seasonal difference but there were significant spatial differences among sampling sites. No significant difference in microplastic levels was observed among the west, south, and east coasts, but microplastic density was higher on beaches with higher tourism activity levels. The most abundant type of microplastics was fiber (>97%) and the most common color was white/transparent (57%). In addition, using a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer we identified microplastics as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP).

Knowledge on the potential effects of micrometer scale plastics on marine microalgae remains limited. It remains unknown whether the micrometer scale plastics also affect microalgal growth, lipid accumulation and resistance to organic contaminants? In addition, the role of polymer-size on the potential hazardous effects of MPs on microalgae is unknown. In the present study, cell populations of a marine diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, were treated with micrometer scale polyethylene (PEMP, 150 ??m) and unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVCMP, 250 ??m) powders in the laboratory. Growth was assessed using a hemacytometer and neutral lipid concentrations were evaluated using the Nile Red staining method under short-term (four days) and long-term (nine days) exposure. The effects of combined PEMP and phenanthrene (Phe), and uPVCMP and Phe exposures over four days on growth were investigated. Importance scores and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to assess the contributions of seven factors in exposure systems to the hazardous effects of MPs on microalgae using a machine-learning prediction based on 165 data sets. Both MP types did not influence algal growth and lipid accumulation but minimized algal inhibition by the action of Phe at four days. In addition, lipid accumulation was induced at nine days. Both importance scores and SHAP values indicated that MP polymer-size was the key factor influencing MP toxicity in microalgae. In conclusion, MPs had adverse effects only in chronic tests and the potential adsorption of MPs could have led to the lower levels of toxicity in a combined MP?€?Phe exposure system. Compared to nanoplastics, MPs in the hundred-micrometer range do not significantly affect growth and their adsorption would not be influenced by size. Therefore, MP size is the most critical factor that should be considered in future laboratory tests and eco-toxicological risk assessments for microalgae. This study revealed the effects of two types of MPs on P. tricornutum and that polymer size was the key factor influencing MP toxicity based on a machine-learning prediction. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

This study examined the feeding ecology of the spider crab Libinia ferreirae, which is commonly associated with the jellyfish Lychnorhiza lucerna during part of its life cycle, especially the juvenile stage. In the adult phase, the crab is a host for many epibionts that live on its carapace. The crabs were collected in 1 year, and the stomach contents were analyzed by the percentage points and the frequency of occurrence of the food items. We identified ten food items (food in the advanced stage of digestion was unidentifiable) and microplastic particles in the gastric contents of the crabs. The food items with high abundances were sediment, crustaceans, and cnidarians. We found niche partitioning of the spider crab?€?s diet during the benthic (free-living) and planktonic (L. lucerna association) phases. The fact that microplastic is part of the diet of L. ferreirae is concerning and shows how environmental contamination with plastic material has been incorporated into the marine food chain as a whole. ?? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

Abundance of the litters increased with number of pleasure crafts in active in summer. Pleasure crafts contributed most abundantly with the personal wares to the total litter, particularly in the coasts of Mu??la. Litters were differentiated with interaction of region ?? bottom depths. The litter composition and abundance were different between region of Antalya in active mostly by tour boats and region of Mu??la by private yachts. The litter types were however correlated with sea surface temperature. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

During the study, 84 different types of litter were determined and a total of 17015 items weighing 168.9 kg were collected. Litter density ranged between 1.22-4.17 items.m-2 and 11.78-37.47 gr.m-2. Plastics comprised 84-91% of total litter. The most common three types of litter were foam (17%), 2.5-50 cm plastic/polystyrene pieces (15%) and caps/lids (10%). Fouling organisms found on litter belonged to Mollusca, Arthropoda and Bryozoa. Litter density showed significant seasonal differences with the highest in summer (P<0.05). Matrix Scoring Technique showed that river runoff (22%), landfill/dumping (21%) and fisheries (18%) were the major sources of the litter. According to Clean Coast Index, the beach was very dirty in all seasons. This study provides further evidence that there is a significant litter pollution in the Southeastern Black Sea and that the main component are plastics, which pose a great treat to Black Sea environment. This call for a scientific understanding of the fate and effects of plastics, as well as actions to reduce the amount of plastics entering Black Sea. ?? 2020, Central Fisheries Research Inst.

MUTVPRYU,10.1371/journal.pone.0228209,Sinking of microbial-associated microplastics in natural waters,"Degraded plastic debris has been found in nearly all waters within and nearby urban developments as well as in the open oceans. Natural removal of suspended microplastics (MPs) by deposition is often limited by their excess buoyancy relative to water, but this can change with the attachment of biological matter. The extent to which the attached biological ballast affects MP dynamics is still not well characterised. Here, we experimentally demonstrate using a novel OMCEC (Optical Measurement of CEll colonisation) system that the biological fraction of MP aggregates has substantial control over their size, shape and, most importantly, their settling velocity. Polyurethane MP aggregates made of 80% biological ballast had an average size almost twice of those containing 5% biological ballast, and sank about two times slower. Based on our experiments, we introduce a settling velocity equation that accounts for different biological content as well as the irregular fractal structure of MP aggregates. This equation can capture the settling velocity of both virgin MPs and microbial-associated MP aggregates in our experiment with 7% error and can be used as a preliminary tool to estimate the vertical transport of MP aggregates made of different polymers and types of microbial ballast. ?? 2020 Nguyen et al.

XLCM2UKM,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109913,Bioavailability and toxicity of microplastics to fish species: A review,"The prevalence of microplastics in aquatic environments has raised concerns about their availability and risks to aquatic biota. Since fish is an important source of animal protein for human beings, the occurrence and potential impacts of microplastics in fishes deserve special attention. Although there have been an increasing number of studies concerning microplastics ingestion and effects in fish, review papers specifically focusing on this issue are few. This review summarized the current knowledge about the bioavailability and toxicity of microplastics to fish species. By collating literatures, it can be concluded that microplastics contamination could occur in almost all types of aquatic habitats around the globe. Both field and laboratory studies suggest that fishes are very susceptible to microplastics ingestion. Compared with marine species, freshwater fishes have been less studied. Microplastics alone or in combination with other contaminants could cause various health problems to fish after exposure. There still exist some debates over the environmental relevance of the laboratory-based effect studies and the relative contribution of microplastics in increasing the exposure of fish to hazardous chemicals. Hopefully, this review could extend the current knowledge on the ecotoxicological impacts of microplastics contamination to fish and provide guidance for future research. ?? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

The 96 h-IC50 value of DBP was 2.41 mg L???1. Polystyrene microplastics exhibited size-dependent inhibitory effect to C. pyrenoidosa, with the 96 h-IC50 at 6.90 and 7.19 mg L???1 for 0.1 and 0.55 ??m mPS respectively, but little toxicity was observed for 5 ??m mPS. The interaction parameter ?? based on the response additive response surface (RARS) model varied from ???0.309 to 5.845, indicating the interaction pattern varying with exposure concentrations of chemical mixtures. A modified RARS model (taking ?? as a function of exposure concentration) was constructed and could well predict the combined toxicity of mPS and DBP. More than 20% reduction of DBP was observed at 20 mg L???1 mPS, while 1 mg L???1 mPS had no significant effect on the bioavailability of DBP at different sampling time points. Volume, morphological complexity and chlorophyll fluorescence intensity of microalgal cells were disturbed by both DBP and mPS. The antagonistic effect of high concentrations of mPS might be partially attributed to the combination of hetero- and homo-aggregation and the reduced bioavailability of DBP. The overall findings of the present study profiled the combined toxic effects of mPS and DBP on marine phytoplankton species which will be helpful for further evaluation of ecological risks of mPS and DBP in marine environment. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

WE4CIFS8,10.1007/s11356-018-3497-6,Accumulation and immunotoxicity of microplastics in the estuarine worm Hediste diversicolor in environmentally relevant conditions of exposure,"The presence of plastic debris < 5 mm called microplastics (MPs) which results mainly from macroplastic?€?s fragmentation has been reported in aquatic ecosystems. Several studies have shown that MPs are persistent and their accumulation was observed in various aquatic species. However, the majority of studies focused on marine species, and much less on continental and estuarine biota. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of a mixture of two types of MPs (polyethylene and polypropylene), frequently found in natural environments, towards the ragworm Hediste diversicolor to determine their accumulation in organisms exposed through the water phase or sediment. Two concentrations of exposure were selected for medium and heavily contaminated areas reported for water phase (10 and 100 ??g/L) and sediment (10 and 50 mg of MPs/kg). To study the potential toxic effect of MPs, immune parameters were selected since they are involved in many defense mechanisms against xenobiotics or infectious agents. An average number of MP items/worm ranging from 0 to 2.5 and from 1 to 36 were identified in animals exposed to the lowest and the highest concentration of MPs through water exposure. In worms exposed through sediment, less than 1 MP/worm was found and a greater number of particles were identified in depurated sediment. For immunotoxic impact, MP exposure induced a decrease in coelomocytes viability, but no alteration of phagocytosis activity, phenoloxydase, and acid phosphatase was measured. This study brings new results on the potential accumulation and immunotoxicity of MPs for the ragworm H. diversicolor who plays a key role in the structure and functioning of estuarine ecosystem. ?? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

A survey of foam macrodebris collected on beaches indeed revealed high concentrations of hexabromocyclododecanes (??HBCDD) in polystyrene (PS) samples (up to 1940 ??g g???1). Results also showed that PS fragments can still leach over 150 ng g???1 d???1 of ??HBCDD (primarily as the ??-isomer) for relatively long durations, and that these additives are readily bioaccumulated and well-retained by corals. Despite significant HBCDD bioaccumulation in coral tissue, short-term exposure to HBCDD or PS leachate had no considerable effect on coral photosynthetic activity, symbiont concentration and chlorophyll content. Exposure to the PS leachate did however cause consistent polyp retraction in nubbins over the 5-day exposure. This response was not observed in animals exposed to HBCDD alone, suggesting that another constituent of the leachate stressed corals. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

As such, chemical additives may be released into the environment, which can affect marine organisms; however, studies of the effects of such additives are lacking. We assessed the effects of leachate from EPS on the photosynthetic activities of four microalgal species (Dunaliella salina, Scenedesmus rubescens, Chlorella saccharophila, and Stichococcus bacillaris). They were exposed to EPS leachate for seven days and their photosynthetic activities were analyzed based on seven parameters. Overall, leachate exposure increased photosynthetic activity in all four species, albeit to different degrees and showing slightly different trends among the seven parameters. Based on chemical analysis, hexabromocyclododecane concentrations were higher in small-fragment leachate, whereas UV326 concentrations were higher in low-concentration-large-sphere leachate; bisphenol-A and total organic carbon showed no major differences among leachates. Thus, we speculate that exposure to trace chemicals influenced microalgal photosynthesis and overall growth. These results support further investigation of the impacts of plastic debris and chemical additives on marine ecosystems and organisms. ?? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",
DZMEWCJH,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113571,Marine invertebrate larvae love plastics: Habitat selection and settlement on artificial substrates,"Global urbanization and plastic pollution has increased the availability and variety of substrates for sessile organisms, and are intensively used by invasive species for settlement. Despite extensive literature describing the strong association between artificial structures and invasive species, little effort has been directed towards identifying the larval traits that favor this selection. Larval selection and settlement are crucial as larvae actively search and interpret environmental cues to identify suitable habitats to settle. The aim of this research was to investigate if invertebrate larvae have a preference for a particular anthropogenic substrate, and how pre-settlement behaviors vary when encountering different substrates. We used two invasive bryozoan species, Bugula flabellata and Bugula neritina, which are commonly found in urbanized areas around the world. Energy expenditure during planktonic and benthonic stages, pre-settlement swimming/exploring behaviors, settlement and larval selectivity were quantified under laboratory conditions on different substrates (concrete, wood, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate). The energy expenditure measured was higher in planktonic larvae than in early settled larvae. Larvae of both species swam less and explored more when exposed to plastic surfaces, suggesting a preference for this substrate and resulting in lower energy expenditures associated with searching for habitat. Larvae actively chose to settle on plastics rather than on wood or concrete substrates. The results suggest that for Bugula larvae, the likelihood of colonizing plastic surfaces is higher than other materials commonly found in urbanized coastal areas. The more quickly they adhere to artificial substrates the lower the energy expenditure, contributing to higher fitness in these individuals. The strong preference of invertebrate larvae for plastics can potentially extend the distribution range of many invasive marine species as they are able to travel long distances attached to floating debris. This phenomenon will likely exacerbate the introduction of exotic species into novel habitats. The larvae of the bryozoan Bugula neritina and Bugula flabellata preferred plastics as settlement surface when compared with concrete and wood. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
4HJ239ZG,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113553,Laundering and textile parameters influence fibers release in household washings,"Synthetic fibers represent one of the main forms of microplastics in marine environment and recently were related to household washings as a source. Although other types of fiber, like natural, do not rely under this classification, there is a potential for them to act as a vector of toxic substances to biota in the same way as microplastics do. Consequently all types of fiber have the potential to cause variable ecologic and socioeconomic impacts. In this scenario, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of washing parameters in the emission of fibers on textiles with different characteristics and fiber content: cotton, acrylic, polyester and polyamide. For this purpose individual garments were sequentially washed with and without detergent. Results showed that the use of a detergent reduced significantly the mass of particles emitted from synthetic garments but not from cotton, which, in relative terms, was responsible for the highest emissions. Textile characteristics such as mass availability and fiber cohesion influenced results, where shorter irregular fibers and lower tenacities dealt to higher releases. For all types of garments tested, 10 sequential cycles decreased particles' release, with peaks in three firsts washes (from 37% to 76%). Taking into account a regular washing machine filter, a considerable mass of fibers (from 40% to 75%) was not retained by this device, indicating a potential for improvement. Together, simple solutions as the use of detergents, three pre-washes and superimposed filter meshes, could diminish >53% of this type of pollution. Besides this potential reduction, globally, in one year, domestic washing machines would still contribute with around 15 thousand tonnes of cotton and synthetic fibers. A structured and sustained solution for this problem should advance in an interdisciplinary approach, fomenting responsibility from plural actors, taken in all stages of products' life cycle. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

The current study assessed the chemical content of freshwater and marine leachates produced from car tire rubber (CTR), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics, and their adverse effects on the microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata (freshwater) and Skeletonema costatum (marine) and the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. A combination of non-target and target chemical analysis revealed a number of organic and metal compounds in the leachates, including representing plasticizers, antioxidants, antimicrobials, lubricants, and vulcanizers. CTR and PVC materials and their corresponding leachates had the highest content of tentatively identified organic additives, while PET had the lowest. The metal content varied both between polymer leachates and between freshwater and seawater. Notable additives identified in high concentrations were benzothiazole (CTR), phthalide (PVC), acetophenone (PP), cobalt (CTR, PET), zinc (CTR, PVC), lead (PP) and antimony (PET). All leachates, except PET, inhibited algal growth with EC50 values ranging from 0.5% (CTR) and 64% (PP) of the total leachate concentration. Leachates also affected mussel endpoints, including the lysosomal membrane stability and early stages endpoints as gamete fertilization, embryonic development and larvae motility and survival. Embryonic development was the most sensitive parameter in mussels, with EC50 values ranging from 0.8% (CTR) to 65% (PET) of the total leachate. The lowest impacts were induced on D-shell larvae survival, reflecting their ability to down-regulate motility and filtration in the presence of chemical stressors. This study provides evidence of the relationship between chemical composition and toxicity of plastic/rubber leachates. Consistent with increasing contamination by organic and inorganic additives, the leachates ranged from slightly to highly toxic to mussels and algae, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the overall impact of plastic-associated chemicals on aquatic ecosystems. ?? 2019 The Authors",
SH8HZLZF,10.1007/s11356-019-07274-5,"Comparison between manta trawl and in situ pump filtration methods, and guidance for visual identification of microplastics in surface waters","Owing to the development and adoption of a variety of methods for sampling and identifying microplastics, there is now data showing the presence of microplastics in surface waters from all over the world. The difference between the methods, however, hampers comparisons, and to date, most studies are qualitative rather than quantitative. In order to allow for a quantitative comparison of microplastics abundance, it is crucial to understand the differences between sampling methods. Therefore, a manta trawl and an in situ filtering pump were compared during realistic, but controlled, field tests. Identical microplastic analyses of all replicates allowed the differences between the methods with respect to (1) precision, (2) concentrations, and (3) composition to be assessed. The results show that the pump gave higher accuracy with respect to volume than the trawl. The trawl, however, sampled higher concentrations, which appeared to be due to a more efficient sampling of particles on the sea surface microlayer, such as expanded polystyrene and air-filled microspheres. The trawl also sampled a higher volume, which decreased statistical counting uncertainties. A key finding in this study was that, regardless of sampling method, it is critical that a sufficiently high volume is sampled to provide enough particles for statistical evaluation. Due to the patchiness of this type of contaminant, our data indicate that a minimum of 26 particles per sample should be recorded to allow for concentration comparisons and to avoid false null values. The necessary amount of replicates to detect temporal or spatial differences is also discussed. For compositional differences and size distributions, even higher particle counts would be necessary. Quantitative measurements and comparisons would also require an unbiased approach towards both visual and spectroscopic identification. To facilitate the development of such methods, a visual protocol that can be further developed to fit different needs is introduced and discussed. Some of the challenges encountered while using FTIR microspectroscopic particle identification are also critically discussed in relation to specific compositions found. ?? 2019, The Author(s).",
KW6RLVU4,,Automatic segregation of plastic waste for recycling industries,"Plastic waste has been a primary environmental concern nowadays due to the increase in its consumption. It is a chemical compound manufactured by adding various chemicals and toxic agents. It is a known fact and at the same time, hard truth that plastic is non-biodegradable, and it causes multiple hazards to the environment and the living beings. Improper disposal of plastic leads to soil pollution, clogging of water on the surface of the earth, death of aquatic species and even more severe impacts on the environment. In our project, segregate the plastic waste without any human intervention. It helps in reducing the man's work, and it also makes the segregation process easier. The only way to eliminate the adverse effects of plastic waste is to recycle it properly such that the amount of waste is reduced and recycled material can be remade as useful plastic products. The plastic products are recycled based on its physical parameters such as size and colour. The process of segregation of plastic based on size and colour is at present is done by labourers at recycling units, which is a prolonged process and also leads to long term health hazards. The slow rates of reuse and recycling, most of them end up in landfills, beaches, oceans and remain there for hundreds of thousands of years. ?? IJSTR 2020.",

The ephyra stage of the jellyfish Aurelia sp. was exposed to both environmental and high concentrations of fluorescent 1?€?4 ??m polyethylene MP (0.01?€?10 mg/L). After 24 and 48 h, MP accumulation, acute (Immobility) and behavioral (Frequency pulsation) endpoints were investigated. MP were detected by confocal and tomographic investigations on gelatinous body and mouth, either attached on the surface or ingested. This interaction was responsible for impairing ephyrae survival and behavior at all tested concentrations after 24 h. Acute and behavioral effects were also related to mechanical disturbance, caused by MP, triggering a loss of radial symmetry. Contaminated ephyrae exposed to clean seawater showed full recovery after 72 h highlighting the organisms without the microspheres, attached on body jellyfish surface around the mouth and lappets. In conclusion, short-term exposure to MP affects ephyrae jellyfish health, impairing both their survival and behavior.

This study analysed spatial and temporal patterns of sea turtle bycatch, and estimated the direct initial mortality rate of these animals, in the industrial double-rig-bottom trawl fishery in south-eastern Brazil. This is also the first attempt to relate bycatch/at-sea mortality in bottom trawling to stranded turtles found along the adjacent coast. The fishery was monitored from October 2015 to April 2018 through data collected voluntarily by the captains of eight industrial double-rig trawlers. Two hundred and one sea turtles were captured during 9362 tows (43,657.52 trawling hours), resulting in a catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 0.0025 ?? 0.0032 turtles h???1 with a standard net of 30.5 m headrope, with no significant difference between the estimated CPUEs for licensed shrimp and demersal fish trawlers. Caretta caretta (52.24%) and Lepidochelys olivacea (38.81%) were the most frequently captured species. According to Generalized Linear Models, C. caretta bycatch was significantly higher during winter, at lower latitudes (???24?? to ???23??) and higher longitudes (???42?? to ???40??), while the L. olivacea bycatch was significantly higher at higher latitudes (???23?? to ???21??). The direct initial mortality rate of sea turtles in the shrimp trawlers was 7.65 ?? 3.85%. However, none of the dead individuals subsequently released with plastic tags (n = 10) were found stranded on the coast. Mortality was not significantly related to the depth or duration of the trawling. The results of this study suggest the need for improvements to the current management of the bottom trawl fishery in Brazil, moving from a species-based to a spatial and seasonal-based approach.

A quantitative survey was conducted for approximately 3 months (May to July 2018) to assess the weight and quantity of various types of SWD. Nine types of SWD from Shilaoren Beach, all of which measured more than 3 cm, were weighed. Total SWD data were estimated and determined to be 11,528 items weighing 218 kg. Similarly, the average composition and weight of SWD were estimated to be 720 items per km and 14 kg per km, respectively. Findings showed that plastic debris were the most dominant (estimated to be 56.69% of all the items per km), followed by paper (14.41%), and then food (7.40%). The weight of plastic debris was also the greatest (4.8 kg per km), followed by those of paper and food (1.65 kg per km). Plastic items were significantly higher (p<0.05) than any other type of debris on the beach during all the 3 months.

2F2FXDHW,10.1007/s11356-018-3345-8,Juvenile fish caging as a tool for assessing microplastics contamination in estuarine fish nursery grounds,"Estuaries serve as nursery grounds for many marine fish species. However, increasing human activities within estuaries and surrounding areas lead to significant habitat quality degradation for the juveniles. In recent years, plastic pollution has become a global environmental issue as plastic debris are found in all aquatic environments with potential adverse impacts on marine biota. Given the important ecological role of estuaries and implications of microplastics (MP) in ecosystems, here we assess the occurrence, number, size, and polymer types of MP ingested by wild and caged juvenile European flounder (Platichthys flesus). We deployed caged fish for 1 month at five sites in three estuaries in the eastern English Channel. The Seine estuary, heavily impacted by manmade modifications and one of the most contaminated estuaries in Europe, was compared to two smaller estuaries (Canche and Liane) less impacted by industrial activities. We found that juvenile flounders (7?€?9 cm) were vulnerable to plastic ingestion. Seventy-five percent of caged fish and 58% of wild caught fish had the presence of MP items in their digestive tract. Fibers (69%) dominated in the fish?€?s digestive tract at all sites. An average of 2.04 ?? 1.93 MP items were ingested by feral juvenile flounder and 1.67 ?? 1.43 by caged juvenile flounder. For the caged fish, the three sites impacted by wastewater treatment plant (Liane, Le Havre harbor, and Rouen) were those with the highest percentage of individuals that has ingested MP items. Most of the isolated items were fibers and blue in color. Polymers identified by micro Raman spectroscopy were polycaprolactam, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyurethane. Although other environmental factors may have affected caged fish condition and mortality, we found no significant correlation with the number of ingested MP.

GI9BGY3L,10.3390/polym12020262,Flexural creep behavior of high-density polyethylene lumber and wood plastic composite lumber made from thermally modified wood,"The use of wood plastic composite lumber as a structural member material in marine applications is challenging due to the tendency of wood plastic composites (WPCs) to creep and absorb water. A novel patent-pending WPC formulation that combines a thermally modified wood flour (as a cellulosic material) and a high strength styrenic copolymer (high impact polystyrene and styrene maleic anhydride) have been developed with advantageous viscoelastic properties (low initial creep compliance and creep rate) compared with the conventional WPCs. In this study, the creep behavior of the WPC and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) lumber in flexure was characterized and compared. Three sample groupings of WPC and HDPE lumber were subjected to three levels of creep stress; 7.5, 15, and 30% of the ultimate flexural strength (Fb) for a duration of 180 days. Because of the relatively low initial creep compliance of the WPC specimens (five times less) compared with the initial creep compliance of HDPE specimens, the creep deformation of HDPE specimens was six times higher than the creep deformation of WPC specimens at the 30% creep stress level. A Power Law model predicted that the strain (3%) to failure in the HDPE lumber would occur in 1.5 years at 30% Fb flexural stress while the predicted strain (1%) failure for the WPC lumber would occur in 150 years. The findings of this study suggest using the WPC lumber in structural application to replace the HDPE lumber in flexure attributable to the low time-dependent deformation when the applied stress value is withing the linear region of the stress-strain relationship. ?? 2020 by the authors.",
WU34W3BF,10.1007/s10853-019-04025-2,Protective action of semi-fluorinated perfluorocyclobutyl polymer coatings against corrosion of mild steel,"This study examines perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) aromatic ether polymers and demonstrates, for the first time, their potential as corrosion-resistant coatings. PFCB polymers are a distinct class of semi-fluorinated polymers that are based on thermal cyclopolymerization of aromatic trifluorovinyl ethers. They combine the flexibility and thermal stability of aromatic ethers with strong fluorocarbon linkages. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic scans reveal that PFCB coatings display protective barrier properties against corrosion attack nearly equal to that of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coatings. The PFCBs also show excellent adhesion to metal surfaces and nonstick properties comparable to that of PVDF. Combined with their high thermal resistance, PFCBs may lead to new corrosion-resistant coatings in marine, oil and gas, and other applications. ?? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

The failure mechanism, mechanical parameters, and modified constitutive model are obtained. The virtual tests using numerical simulation were carried out in different penetration velocities based on quasi-static experimental constitutive parameters. Influence of projectile shape, face-sheet thickness, core thickness, and core densities on the residual velocity and plastic deformation of sandwich plates are discussed, while typical penetration failure modes and deformation mechanism are presented and analyzed. The failure modes of sandwich plates are different for hemisphere- and blunted-nosed projectile and the projectile shape influence is significant for ballistic performance when the penetration velocity approaches ballistic limit. The ballistic limit increases with increase of face-sheet or core thickness, core density and which shows an approximate linear relationship. ?? The Author(s) 2019.",

In the present study, three types of hexagonal reinforced honeycomb-like structures were developed and analyzed subjected to out-of-plane compression, namely triangular honeycomb (TH), double honeycomb (DH) and full inside honeycomb (FH). Theoretical formulas of average force and specific energy absorption (SEA) were constructed based on the energy minimization principle. To validate, corresponding numerical simulations were carried out by explicit finite element method. Good agreement has been observed between them. The results show that all these honeycomb-like structures maintain the same collapsed stages as conventional honeycomb; cell reinforcement can significantly promote the performance, both in the average force and SEA; full inside honeycomb performs better than the general, triangular and double schemes in average force; meanwhile, its SEA is close to that of double scheme; toroidal surface can dissipate higher plastic energy, so more toroidal surfaces should be considered in design of thin-walled structure. These achievements pave a way for designing high-performance cellular energy absorption devices. ?? 2020, Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

Under wave troughs, the effective stress in the seabed could be reduced significantly due to the upward seepage caused by vertical pore-pressure gradients. To investigate the influence of wave loading on the vertical soil resistance to a buried pipe, a plane-strain poro-elastoplastic model is proposed and verified with the existing pipe-soil interaction test results and DNV GL predictions. The model is capable of sequentially simulating the pore-pressure generation in a sandy seabed under waves and the plastic-zone development while uplifting the pipe. Numerical results show that the presence of wave troughs could not only reduce the soil effective stress, but also generate an additional uplift force on the buried pipe due to non-uniform distribution of pore-pressures along the pipe periphery. The normalized additional uplift force generally increases linearly with normalized amplitude of wave pressures at seabed mudline. Parametric study is then performed to examine the influence of wave parameters and soil properties. Moreover, to qualitatively characterize the effect of wave loading, a resistance-reduction coefficient is introduced and found to decrease linearly with the increase of normalized amplitude of wave pressure at seabed mudline. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
57Z479EF,10.1111/oik.06698,Long-term warming affects ecosystem functioning through species turnover and intraspecific trait variation,"Effects of climate change on natural ecosystems can be mediated by ecological processes, but also by rapid evolutionary adaptations and/or non-heritable trait changes in organisms. So far, most studies testing the importance of inter- versus intraspecific changes for how communities and their functioning responds to climate change are either short-term laboratory experiments in highly controlled (artificial) environments, or long-term field surveys suffering from lack of experimental manipulation. Here, we quantified how community composition and functioning has changed in response to long-term warming, including the potential direct and indirect effects via immediate and delayed physiological, non-heritable plastic, ecological, evolutionary and eco-evolutionary responses. We used a site-for-time approach, sampling sites in an artificially heated basin and a nearby area to quantify how >30 years of experimental warming in situ affects benthic grazer communities and traits of grazer taxa, as well as their contribution to a key ecosystem function: grazing on filamentous algae. The community composition shifted with warming, because a non-native species was highly common, and taxa with higher mobility, became more common in the heated areas compared to the control sites. Warming altered community functioning but the underlying mechanisms varied between traits: increased metabolism was caused by intraspecific trait change, while increased grazing rate was mainly driven by species turnover. Our results suggest that both population- and community-level processes mediate the responses of natural communities to long-term environmental change, and that the ongoing warming of coastal waters is likely to alter the functioning of key marine ecosystems. ?? 2019 Nordic Society Oikos.

Here, we use high-resolution three-dimensional thermo-mechanical numerical modeling to characterize the evolution of the structural style associated with varying geometries of oblique rifting in a layered continental lithosphere. Automatic analysis of the distribution of active extensional shear zones at the surface of the model demonstrates a characteristic sequence of deformation. Phase 1 with initial localization of deformation and development of wide moderately oblique en-??chelon grabens limited by extensional shear zones oriented close to orthogonal to ??3 trend. Subsequent widening of the grabens is accompanied by progressive rotation of the phase 1 extensional shear zones to an orientation sub-orthogonal to the plate motion direction. Phase 2 is characterized by narrowing of active deformation resulting from thinning of the continental mantle lithosphere and development of a second-generation of extensional shear zones. During phase 2 deformation localizes both on plate motion direction-orthogonal structures that reactivate rotated phase 1 shear zones, and on new moderately oblique structures parallel to ??2. Finally, phase 3 consists in the oblique rupture of the continental lithosphere and produces an oceanic domain where oblique ridge segments are linked with highly oblique accommodation zones. We conclude that while new structures form and trend parallel to ??2 in an oblique rift, progressive rotation and long-term slip along phase 1 structures promotes orthorhombic fault systems, which accommodate upper crustal extension and control oblique passive margin architecture. The distribution, orientation, and evolution of frictional-plastic structures observed in our models consistent with documented fault populations in the Main Ethiopian Rift and the Gulf of Aden conjugate passive margins, both of which developed in moderately oblique extensional settings. ?? 2019 The Author(s)",
49FKVTWI,10.3390/ijerph17030777,Modeling of the concentrations of ultrafine particles in the plumes of ships in the vicinity of major harbors,"Marine traffic in harbors can be responsible for significant atmospheric concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFPs), which have widely recognized negative effects on human health. It is therefore essential to model and measure the time evolution of the number size distributions and chemical composition of UFPs in ship exhaust to assess the resulting exposure in the vicinity of shipping routes. In this study, a sequential modelling chain was developed and applied, in combination with the data measured and collected in major harbor areas in the cities of Helsinki and Turku in Finland, during winter and summer in 2010?€?2011. The models described ship emissions, atmospheric dispersion, and aerosol dynamics, complemented with a time?€? microenvironment?€?activity model to estimate the short-term UFP exposure. We estimated the dilution ratio during the initial fast expansion of the exhaust plume to be approximately equal to eight. This dispersion regime resulted in a fully formed nucleation mode (denoted as Nuc2). Different selected modelling assumptions about the chemical composition of Nuc2 did not have an effect on the formation of nucleation mode particles. Aerosol model simulations of the dispersing ship plume also revealed a partially formed nucleation mode (Nuc1; peaking at 1.5 nm), consisting of freshly nucleated sulfate particles and condensed organics that were produced within the first few seconds. However, subsequent growth of the new particles was limited, due to efficient scavenging by the larger particles originating from the ship exhaust. The transport of UFPs downwind of the ship track increased the hourly mean UFP concentrations in the neighboring residential areas by a factor of two or more up to a distance of 3600 m, compared with the corresponding UFP concentrations in the urban background. The substantially increased UFP concentrations due to ship traffic significantly affected the daily mean exposures in residential areas located in the vicinity of the harbors. ?? 2020 by the authors.

PRR2C6BM,10.1016/j.est.2019.101071,Effects of triggering and polyurethane foam on energy absorption of thin-walled circular tubes under the inversion process,"In this article, an attempt has been made to increase energy absorption and control suddenly applied load in the inversion process of both empty and foam-filled circular tubes. For this purpose, rigid steel die as a triggering mechanism is installed on the shock absorber. When the circular tube is subjected to axial compression, it is driven into the trigger and the empty tube is expanded or polyurethane foam is compressed as much as the trigger's length. In this new innovation process, the effects of triggering and polyurethane foam are investigated on specific energy absorption (SEA), initial peak load and inversion mechanism. To do so, numerical simulation is carried out to evaluate the shock absorber performance. To verify the results of numerical simulation, some quasi-static experimental tests are conducted. In the light of the results, employing a trigger at the bottom of the foam-filled tubes causing an increase in the energy absorption in comparison with the empty ones. In addition, the presence of trigger prevents the suddenly applied load to occupants and the main part of structures. Therefore, this mechanism could be a palatable alternative as an energy absorption system in structural safety design. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Our goal was to assess harbor conditions including dissolved copper pollution, position in relation to open coast, temperature, and artificial structure density (substrate for fouling) as determinants of macroinvertebrate recruitment. Settlement panels were deployed over a gradient of human coastal modification (28 sites in California and 2 in southern Australia). Non-indigenous macroinvertebrates dominated panel cover (overall by six-fold compared to indigenous taxa). Marinas and sites of heavy shipping showed high macroinvertebrate diversity, contrasting with open-coast sites of lower human impact [Santa Catalina Island (SCI) and one mainland coastal site] where there was low macroinvertebrate fouling. At two SCI sites with low vessel traffic, invertebrates that were rare on exposed panels were more common in a protected space between plastic strips indicating larvae amount does not completely explain low invertebrate diversity, suggesting a contributing role of predators or larval recruitment pattern. While dissolved copper levels correlated strongly with artificial structure measured at the water surface, the pollution gradient was not supported as a driver of macroinvertebrate diversity in semi-partial analysis. Density of artificial structure was supported as a better predictor of macroinvertebrate diversity, including separately analyzed non-indigenous and indigenous groups, than dissolved copper, distance from open coast or temperature variation in semi-partial correlation analysis. An artificial structure density measure may therefore increase power in predicting abundance of fouling organisms and could be useful in moderating the influence of non-indigenous species. ?? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

Also, the effort to avoid the use of petrochemical or chemical derivatives in the production-chain increased the exploitation of by-products and biomass. In this work, the raw materials such as montmorillonite (Mt), the chitosan (CS) which is a sea-food byproduct, and the natural essential oil extract thyme oil (TO) were combined via two different methods for the development of an advanced nanocomposite active packaging film for foods. In the first method, the so-called ?€?Solution-Blending?€? (SB), a CS/TO solution was blended with sodium?€?montmorillonite (NaMt) or organomodified-montmorillonite (OrgMt). In the second method, the so-called ?€?ModifiedClay?€? (MC), the TO was adsorbed into NaMt or OrgMt and the produced hybrid was added to CS. The tests indicated that nanocomposite films which were prepared via the MC method are promising materials for active packaging films. Practical applications: Nowadays, a lot of effort is spent on finding advanced food conservation methods which extend shelf time, increase quality, and vanish the food odor problems. This study shows that films which are prepared via the modified clay method exhibit high antioxidant behavior and high antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. Also, tests on under-vacuum packaged chicken breast fillets exhibit low lipid oxidation values. Thus, these films/pads are promising for active packaging applications of meat and other food products. ?? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In the present study, CFRP single-cell and multi-cell tubes are manufactured, and the same overall dimensions and mass for all specimens are guaranteed through allocating different thickness of each side. The crushing process and energy-absorbing capacity of all specimens are experimentally investigated under the quasi-static axial crushing load. According to the experimental results, it is known that the single-cell tube develops unstable local buckling mode, and the multi-cell tubes with two configurations crush progressively. Total energy absorption of the multi-cell tubes are almost 69% higher than that of the single-cell tube. Subsequently, numerical simulations are further conducted to provide additional insights into the underlying energy-absorbing mechanisms of the multi-cell tubes. The numerical results indicate that intra-laminar energy is the primary energy-absorbing mechanism for all configurations, and the energy absorbed by each part in the multi-cell tubes are much higher than the corresponding part in the single-cell tube. Based on the validated numerical models, the influences of wall thickness and cells number (n) on crashworthiness characteristics of multi-cell tubes are further investigated by performing a comparative analysis. It is found that the energy-absorbing capacity is slightly increased with raising cells number, and energy-absorbing capacity gradually increases with increasing layer number of inner cross beam. Finally, the CFRP multi-cell tube with n = 3 is further optimized, and as a result SEA is improved by 4.68% from the initial design. This study is expected to provide guideline for crashworthiness design of CFRP multi-cell structures. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

The environmental issues linked to NPs are attributed to the effects after ingestion in marine organisms. Due to the incipient and controversial information about the effects of PS NPs on the feeding of organisms, the aim of this work is to assess (i) digestion dynamics of Artemia franciscana when exposed to PS NPs as the lowest concentration of PS NPs reported in toxicity test [0 (control), 0.006 and 0.6 mg??L-1] and possible interferences in the ingestion of microalgae and (ii) the accumulation and depuration of PS NPs by A. franciscana. Artemia were subjected to ingestion experiments [24 h and 3.5 h], in which the organisms were exposed to PS NPs or to PS NPs + microalgae. Post-exposure feeding (24 h exposure and 2 h feeding) and depuration (24 h exposure and 24 h of depuration) were also carried out. More than 90% of the PS NPs were ingested by Artemia and bioaccumulated in the mandible, stomach, gut, tail gut and appendages after 24 h. The ingestion of microalgae was not affected by the presence of the PS NPs. Data of post-exposure feeding indicated that Artemia previously exposed to plastic and/or microalgae presented similar microalgal ingestion (around 70%); the highest microalgal consumption (around 90%) was recorded in the treatment in which Artemia were previously starved (no plastic and no microalgae). The presence of PS NPs in the gut after the depuration experiments indicates that 24 h was not enough to eliminate the PS NPs. ?? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

GQ7WDTN5,10.1093/aob/mcz097,Ontogenetic variation in salinity tolerance and ecophysiology of coastal dune plants,"?€? Background and Aims Global climate change includes shifts in temperature and precipitation, increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and sea level rise, which will drastically impact coastal ecosystems. The aim of this study is to quantify salinity tolerance and to identify physiological mechanisms underlying tolerance across wholeplant ontogeny in two widespread native coastal plant species in Hawaii, Jacquemontia sandwicensis (Convolvulaceae) and Sida fallax (Malvaceae). ?€? Methods At the seed, seedling, juvenile and mature ontogenetic stages, plants were exposed to high salinity watering treatments. Tolerance was assayed as the performance of stressed compared with control plants using multiple fitness metrics, including germination, survival, growth and reproduction. Potential physiological mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance were measured at each ontogenetic stage, including: photosynthesis and stomatal conductance rates, leaf thickness, leaf mass per area and biomass allocation. ?€? Key Results Salinity tolerance varied between species and across ontogeny but, overall, salinity tolerance increased across ontogeny. For both species, salinity exposure delayed flowering. Physiological and morphological leaf traits shifted across plant ontogeny and were highly plastic in response to salinity. Traits enhancing performance under high salinity varied across ontogeny and between species. For J. sandwicensis, water use efficiency enhanced growth for juvenile plants exposed to high salinity, while chlorophyll content positively influenced plant growth under salinity in the mature stage. For S. fallax, transpiration enhanced plant growth only under low salinity early in ontogeny; high transpiration constrained growth under high salinity across all ontogenetic stages. ?€? Conclusions That salinity effects vary across ontogenetic stages indicates that demographic consequences of sea level rise and coastal flooding will influence population dynamics in complex ways. Furthermore, even coastal dune plants presumably adapted to tolerate salinity demonstrate reduced ecophysiological performance, growth and reproduction under increased salinity, highlighting the conservation importance of experimental work to better project climate change effects on plants. ??

Rivers play an important role in transporting this debris from communities to ocean systems, and yet we lack data on debris in freshwater systems. This work promotes eliminating the gap in knowledge between debris in marine and freshwater systems through use of a consistent, replicable methodology that can be used to improve data on freshwater shoreline debris. Expansion in the application of this method globally can allow researchers to ground-truth estimates of the debris entering the world's oceans via rivers. Widespread use of this method would provide data on the litter degrading in the world's riverine systems, an important ecological problem in its own right often sidelined in work on marine debris. Improved ground-truthing will also shed light on the missing plastics question: the disparity between input estimates and measurement of plastic waste in the world's oceans. Cataloging the way debris moves through, and remains a part of, freshwater systems is imperative to addressing the global plastic waste problem.

YI7UY2H6,10.3389/fmars.2019.00808,A Critical Examination of the Role of Marine Snow and Zooplankton Fecal Pellets in Removing Ocean Surface Microplastic,"Numerical simulations and emissions estimates of plastic in and to the ocean consistently over-predict the surface inventory, particularly in the case of microplastic (MP), i.e., fragments less than 5 mm in length. Sequestration in the sediments has been both predicted and, to a limited extent, observed. It has been hypothesized that biology may be exporting a significant fraction of surface MP by way of marine snow aggregation and zooplankton fecal pellets. We apply previously published data on MP concentrations in the surface ocean to an earth system model of intermediate complexity to produce a first estimate of the potential global sequestration of MP by marine aggregates, including fecal pellets. We find a MP seafloor export potential of between 7.3E3 and 4.2E5 metric tons per year, or about 0.06?€?8.8% of estimated total annual plastic ocean pollution rates. We find that presently, aggregates alone would have the potential to remove most existing surface ocean MP to the seafloor within less than 2 years if pollution ceases. However, the observed accumulation of MP in the surface ocean, despite this high potential rate of removal, suggests that detrital export is an ineffective pathway for permanent MP removal. We theorize a prominent role of MP biological fouling and de-fouling in the rapid recycling of aggregate-associated MP in the upper ocean. We also present an estimate of how the potential detrital MP sink might change into the future, as climate change (and projected increasing MP pollution) alters the marine habitat. The polar regions, and the Arctic in particular, are projected to experience increasing removal rates as export production increases faster than MP pollution. Northern hemisphere subtropical gyres are projected to experience slowing removal rates as stratification and warming decrease export production, and MP pollution increases. However, significant uncertainty accompanies these results. ?? Copyright ?? 2020 Kvale, Friederike Prowe and Oschlies.",

Once counted and characterized for shape, color, and size, microplastic abundances were normalized to the results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on randomly selected particles. The results indicate that 78% of the fragments and only 33% of the fibers analyzed were plastic. The normalized microplastic quantities ranged from 6 to 2444 particles per kg of dry weight sediment (kg-1 dw). The greatest number of microplastics were identified in samples of the finest grain sizes and with the greatest amount of organic debris. Although there was no significant difference between microplastic abundances in urban versus rural locations, the average microplastic count for urban samples was greater (269 vs 195 kg-1 dw). In terms of river morphology, samples from along straight courses of the river contained fewer microplastics than samples from inner and outer bends. Overall abundances confirm how rivers contain a significant number of plastic particles and thus may be major conduits of microplastics to lake and ocean basins. ?? 2019 American Chemical Society.",
4PSPAPKX,10.1021/acs.est.9b04812,Abundance of Floating Plastic Particles Is Increasing in the Western North Atlantic Ocean,"Since the start of commercial plastics production in the 1940s, global production has rapidly accelerated, doubling approximately every 11 years. Despite this increase and clear evidence of plastics loss into the oceans, including a substantial standing stock, previous research has not detected a temporal trend in plastic particle concentration in the surface ocean. Using a generalized additive statistical model, we examined the longest data set on floating plastic debris available globally, collected using plankton nets in the western North Atlantic from 1986 to 2015. There was a significant increasing temporal trend in plastic particle concentration that tracked cumulative global plastics production. We estimated an increase of 506,000 tons of floating plastic in the ocean in 2010 alone or 0.2% of global production. Our results suggest that, while loss of plastic particles from the surface ocean undoubtedly occurs, the input exceeds the collective losses. ?? 2019 American Chemical Society.",
WHQCVCHN,10.1088/1755-1315/430/1/012011,Preliminary Investigation on the Type and Ditribution of Microplastics in the West Coast of Karimun Besar Island,"High anthropogenic activity on the west coast of Karimun Besar Island contributes certain amount of wastes, especially plastics. Plastics will be degraded due to natural mechanism to smaller parts and known as microplastics. Small size and wide spread distribution has caused microplastics can be found widely in the waters and coastal areas. This study aims to determine type and abundance of microplastic in sediment on the west coast of Karimun Besar Island. Sampling of sediment for microplastic was determined based on hydrodynamic conditions by placing quadrat in the highest tidal boundary area. Sediment samples were collected in February 2019 using 4 inch PVC pipe from two different depth, i.e 0-10 and 10-20 cm. Separation of microplastic particles from sediments was carried out in Marine Chemistry Laboratory, Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science University of Riau through several stages, namely (a) drying, (b) separation of densities and (c) sorting visually. The results of the study found only 3 types of microplastic, i.e. fragments, films and fibers. Microplastic abundance in sediments was found between 1976.67-2203.33 particles/kg of sediment with fibers being the dominant type. Fiber has the highest abundance in both depths followed by films and fragments. ANOVA and t-test analysis, showed that the quantity of microplastic between stations and between two different depths were not significantly different (p > 0,05). ?? 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

H9LWIZU9,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.117138,Effect of loading rates on bond behaviour between basalt fibre-reinforced polymer bars and concrete,"In this study, bond performance between basalt fibre-reinforced polymer bars and sea sand concrete was investigated using pull-out tests that considered two parameters, loading rate and concrete type. All pull-out specimens exhibited a pull-out failure mode. Moreover, bond mechanism, bond strength, slip, and bond stress?€?slip curve are discussed. The bond behaviour was found to be sensitive to the loading rate. The bond mechanism was controlled by mechanical interlocking at static loading rate, friction at the earthquake loading rate, and chemical adhesion and the shear strength of the fibre layers at impact loading rate. The bond strength with a high-speed loading rate was lower than that with a static loading rate. The variation trends for the bond strength and slip differed with the type of loading rate. Finally, formulae are proposed for estimating a dynamic influence factor, which is used to evaluate the influence of the strain rate on the bond strength and slip. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
BZQUJHXT,10.5194/tc-14-93-2020,Feature-based comparison of sea ice deformation in lead-permitting sea ice simulations,"The sea ice modeling community is progressing towards pan-Arctic simulations that explicitly resolve leads in the simulated sea ice cover. Evaluating these simulations against observations poses new challenges. A new feature-based evaluation of simulated deformation fields is introduced, and the results are compared to a scaling analysis of sea ice deformation. Leads and pressure ridges - here combined into linear kinematic features (LKFs) - are detected and tracked automatically from deformation and drift data. LKFs in two pan-Arctic sea ice simulations with a horizontal grid spacing of 2 km are compared with an LKF dataset derived from the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS). One simulation uses a five-class ice thickness distribution (ITD). The simulated sea ice deformation follows a multi-fractal spatial and temporal scaling, as observed from RGPS. The heavy-tailed distribution of LKF lengths and the scale invariance of LKF curvature, which points to the self-similar nature of sea ice deformation fields, are reproduced by the model. Interannual and seasonal variations in the number of LKFs, LKF densities, and LKF orientations in the ITD simulation are found to be consistent with RGPS observations. The lifetimes and growth rates follow a distribution with an exponential tail. The model overestimates the intersection angle of LKFs, which is attributed to the model's viscous-plastic rheology with an elliptical yield curve. In conclusion, the new feature-based analysis of LKF statistics is found to be useful for a comprehensive evaluation of simulated deformation features, which is required before the simulated features can be used with confidence in the context of climate studies. As such, it complements the commonly used scaling analysis and provides new useful information for comparing deformation statistics. The ITD simulation is shown to reproduce LKFs sufficiently well for it to be used for studying the effect of directly resolved leads in climate simulations. The feature-based analysis of LKFs also identifies specific model deficits that may be addressed by specific parameterizations, for example, a damage parameter, a grounding scheme, and a Mohr-Coulombic yield curve. ?? 2020 Author(s).",

Marine litter is an understudied issue in the Regional Organisation for Protection of the Marine Environment (ROPME) Sea Area where rapid economic growth has already placed considerable stress on infrastructure and coastal ecosystems. This paper outlines some of the drivers for waste generation in region and reviews the available literature to summarise the current state of knowledge on the environmental fate, behaviour and impact of marine litter within the ROPME Sea Area. While data is limited, those studies conducted demonstrate marine litter is posing a clear and growing threat to the environmental and socioeconomic prosperity of the ROPME Sea Area. The development of regional and national marine litter reduction plans are clearly a priority to focus and coordinate activity across multiple stakeholders. Discussion of the potential environmental impacts arising as a result of marine litter are presented together with a roadmap for establishing and implementing a ROPME Sea Area Marine Litter and Single-Use Plastic Action Plan. ?? 2019",

However, in comparison to marine environments, the occurrence of microplastics in a tidal river system remains largely unknown, especially in river sediments. Sediment samples taken from twenty-two sampling points along Brisbane River over the four different seasons revealed relatively high concentrations of microplastics in river sediments, with abundance ranging from 0.18 to 129.20 mg kg???1, or 10 to 520 items kg???1. Unfortunately, varied methods and units used for reporting do not allow the accurate comparison between related studies. The spatial distributions of microplastics hotspots indicated that microplastics abundance is distance-dominated caused by flow velocities. Lower and higher concentrations of microplastics abundance mostly occurred in dry and wet seasons, respectively. Significant temporal variations of microplastics concentrations was observed in residential and commercial areas. Polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA) and polypropylene (PP), were the three main polymer types found in the Brisbane River sediments. Other polymer types such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were also detected. The majority of the detected microplastic particles were found to be &lt;3 mm. This study reveals the abundance, spatial and temporal distribution patterns, and characteristics of microplastic pollutants in Brisbane River sediments, and provides systematic data for further research on microplastics in estuarine environments worldwide. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

The research on marine debris is carried out in the estuary and mangrove forest areas of Kendari Bay which is assumed to be accommodated garbage sites that enter the coastal area. The purpose of this study is to identify the types of composition and potential sources of marine waste contributors found in several river estuaries and mangrove forest areas, to know the density of marine debris and to mapping the distribution of marine debris from several river estuaries and mangrove forest in Kendari Bay. This research was conducted by survey method and using 5x5 quadratic plots in a random sampling. The data obtained were analyzed statistically and map overlays. The results showed that the composition of marine debris types in mangrove ecosystems and estuaries in Kendari bay generally consisted of plastic (plastic bottles, plastic bags, ropes, pipettes, plastic cups), metals (beverage cans), rubber, glass (glass bottles) and others (cloth, paper and others) with the dominant amount of plastic waste. The highest total density of waste types in the four locations in the mangrove ecosystem and river estuary in Kendari Bay is at station 1 (Lahundape Mangrove Tracking Area). The density of plastic waste dominates the four locations in the mangrove ecosystem with the highest value of 3,024 items/m2 in the mangrove ecosystem around the estuary of Mandonga and Lahundape. The high distribution of marine debris in the mangrove ecosystem is found at station 1 and station 2 because it is directly related to the river flow which contributes greatly to marine debris input in Kendari Bay. ??

A gasification model was demonstrated to reveal the gasification path. Different gasification models were compared to improve gasification efficiency. The response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to find the optimal gasification condition. Moreover, artificial seawater was used for gasification instead of ultrapure water. The results showed that the polypropylene plastic was a difficult gasification substance, the increase in temperature and time had a positive effect on the improvement of gasification, while increasing the feedstock concentration was not conducive to gasification. The optimal condition was 750 ??C and 60 min, and the effect of temperature on gasification was more important than time. The gasification model believed that in the initial gasification stage, the easy aromatization of the fragments was key to generating tar. So a 10 wt% formic acid solution was employed to improve gasification, on which the 79.86 wt% of carbon conversion (CE) was obtained. Finally, seawater gasification results showed that seawater components had a positive impact on the gasification of PP plastics, which was an effective way to solve marine microplastics. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Compared with moderate critical conditions of conventional eco-friendly sub/supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc???CO2), a novel and sustainable procedure by using improved Sc???CO2 was developed for disposal of this type of plastic. The main merit of the process was that complex halogen-containing plastics were safely disposed and halogen-free products were recycled without using catalysts or additives. It was discovered that additive BFRs were initially extracted by Sc???CO2 technique and then it decomposed accompanied with PVC rapidly to form HBr and HCl, which could be separated by traditional bromine stripping techniques from seawater. Based on response surface methodology (RSM), the maximum debromination and dechlorination efficiencies were achieved at 99.51% and 99.12% respectively. After the treatment, halogen-free products such as solid carbon materials and organic chemical feedstocks were obtained. Mechanism study elucidated that free radicals reaction involving chain initiation, growth and termination induced the polymer decomposition to form these products. This study provides an applicable and green approach for disposal and recovery of halogen-containing plastics. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",
K6Z8BAZF,10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.111534,"On lateral compression of circular aluminum, CFRP and GFRP tubes","Thin-walled structures made of lightweight materials, e.g. aluminum, fiber reinforced composites, have been increasingly used as energy absorption structures in vehicles. This work aimed to characterize the lateral crushing behaviors of circular aluminum, glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) and carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) tubes with different geometric configuration such as diameter-to-thickness (D/T) ratio or thickness. In the experimental investigation, four different D/T ratios varied from 10.78 to 48.02 were considered here for the aluminum, GFRP and CFRP tubes. Crushing behaviors such as force-displacement curves, deformation histories, and crushing force were quantified. The experimental results revealed that the load carrying capacities, energy absorption (EA) and specific energy absorption (SEA) of the circular tubes decline with increasing D/T ratio. It was found that better crashworthy characteristics of thicker composites, with a smaller D/T ratio, were due to the more favorable failure modes occurring throughout lateral compression. The lateral crashworthy performance of the GFRP tubes was marginally better than that of the CFRP counterparts. Due to ductile behavior of aluminum tubes and brittle behavior of composites, aluminum tubes showed much better lateral crashworthiness than that of the composite counterparts. Moreover, with the increase in the D/T ratio, aluminum tubes exhibited greater advantage on crashworthiness than the composite tubes. On the basis of the experimental data, explicit finite element analysis was further carried out for modeling the lateral crushing behavior of aluminum, GFRP and CFRP tubes. The numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental data, demonstrating the validity of these finite element (FE) models in predicting lateral crushing responses of aluminum, GFRP and CFRP tubes. The proposed FE models can be exploited to further study similar thin-walled metal and composite structures for design optimization. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Six target corrosion levels were applied to rebars and stirrups using an electrochemical accelerated corrosion technique. Axial compression loading and cyclic loading tests were carried out with six specimens per group. The test results showed that mechanical parameters of pier specimens degraded with an increase in corrosion. The ultimate load, ductility factor, energy dissipation decreased by 29.96%, 9.26%, 67.44% for axial compression specimen with 15.82% rebar mass loss compared to those of intact specimen; for cyclic loading specimens, they decreased by 10.69%, 21.47%, 57.46% with 15.71% rebar mass loss, respectively. Comparative analysis showed that the difference for the degradation level of dimensionless parameters was not obvious between axial compression loading and cyclic loading tests. Findings also showed that for severely corroded specimens, the plastic hinge zone transferred from the bottom of RC piers to the splash and tidal zones. Although the extent of the degradation of the results between the published paper and this test shows significant variations; degradation of dimensionless energy dissipation was always the most serious one. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
3XF63PC2,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.106667,Effect of principal stress rotation on dynamic characteristics of a sandy seabed under a partially reflected standing wave,"Principal stress rotation (PSR) is one of the main stress conditions for a soil element subject to cyclic waves. It is one of the main causes behind generation of excess pore water pressure and cumulative plastic strain in soil deposits when drainage conditions are impeded, and thus compromises the stability of any supported marine structures. This paper aims to investigate the influence of PSR on the cyclic characteristics of soil under standing waves that are partially reflected, in which a generalized plasticity model considering the effect of PSR was adopted to model the soil behavior. Comparisons between the present model, previous hollow cylinder apparatus tests, and geotechnical centrifugal wave tests all show good agreement. Numerical results indicate that ignoring the PSR involved in the standing-wave?€?seabed interactions will significantly underestimate the build-up of pore water pressure, particularly at the standing wave nodes. Furthermore, the exclusion of the effect of PSR may lead to contradictory results in terms of susceptibility to liquefaction between the antinode and the node, when compared to the wave flume test and geotechnical centrifuge test. Numerical simulation results also demonstrate that while considering the impact of PSR, a sandy seabed exhibits higher liquefaction resistance when subjected to standing waves compared to the case when subjected to progressive waves with an equivalent wave height. Parametric studies show that the coefficient of wave reflection, wave characteristics (wave height, period, and water depth), and soil properties (permeability and saturation) significantly affect the liquefaction characteristics of soil under partially reflected standing waves. ?? 2019",

The outreach activities described herein encompass environmental chemistry, sustainable chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials science, ocean ecology, and computational chemistry. Peer instruction and process-oriented guided inquiry-based learning are used to guide student learning. Through these active learning approaches, students learn the differences in chemical structures of common plastics and how these differences define which plastics readily break down into microplastics in the ocean. A systems-thinking approach is used to place the chemistry of plastics into the context of sustainability initiatives, ocean impacts, and the utility of plastic in our everyday lives. Students were given the choice of a laboratory report or a service-learning assignment as a summative assessment. Results of formative assessments, including responses to peer instruction questions, are presented, and considerations for other institutions that may be interested in implementing this material in their courses are discussed.

PEXRLTXU,10.5194/essd-12-77-2020,"Hyperspectral ultraviolet to shortwave infrared characteristics of marine-harvested, washed-ashore and virgin plastics","Combating the imminent environmental problems associated with plastic litter requires a synergy of monitoring strategies, clean-up efforts, policymaking and interdisciplinary scientific research. Lately, remote sensing technologies have been evolving into a complementary monitoring strategy that might have future applications in the operational detection and tracking of plastic litter at repeated intervals covering wide geospatial areas. We therefore present a dataset of Lambertian-equivalent spectral reflectance measurements from the ultraviolet (UV, 350 nm) to shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2500 nm) of synthetic hydrocarbons (plastics). Spectral reflectance of wet and dry marine-harvested, washed-ashore, and virgin plastics was measured outdoors with a hyperspectral spectroradiometer. Samples were harvested from the major accumulation zones in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, suggesting a near representation of plastic litter in global oceans. We determined a representative bulk average spectral reflectance for the dry marine-harvested microplastics dataset available at https://doi.org/10.21232/jyxq-1m66 (Garaba and Dierssen, 2019c). Similar absorption features were identified in the dry samples of washed-ashore plastics: dataset available at https://doi.org/10.21232/ex5j-0z25 (Garaba and Dierssen, 2019a). The virgin pellets samples consisted of 11 polymer types typically found in floating aquatic plastic litter: dataset available at https://doi.org/10.21232/C27H34 (Garaba and Dierssen, 2017). Magnitude and shape features of the spectral reflectance collected were also evaluated for two scenarios involving dry and wet marine-harvested microplastics: dataset available at https://doi.org/10.21232/r7gg-yv83 (Garaba and Dierssen, 2019b). Reflectance of wet marine-harvested microplastics was noted to be lower in magnitude but had similar spectral shape to that of dry marine-harvested microplastics. Diagnostic absorption features common in the marine-harvested microplastics and washed-ashore plastics were identified at ??? 931, 1215, 1417 and 1732 nm. In addition, we include metrics for a subset of the marine-harvested microplastics related to particle morphology, including sphericity and roundness. These datasets are also expected to improve and expand the scientific evidence-based knowledge of optical characteristics of common plastics found in aquatic litter. Furthermore, these datasets have potential use in radiative transfer simulations exploring the effects of plastics on ocean colour remote sensing and developing algorithms applicable to remote detection of floating plastic litter. ??

Understanding the distribution of microplastics is fundamental to evaluating the ecological risks that they cause and to identifying ways to control microplastics pollution. Most of the existing research on the distribution of microplastics in the coastal zone has focused on large spatial and temporal scales. To build on past work, we investigated variation in microplastics in a tidal flat of the Yangtze Estuary on small spatial (sediment depth, mudflat vs. vegetation zone) and temporal (fortnightly and semidiurnal) scales. Microplastics were more abundant in surface (0?€?2 cm) sediments during neap versus spring tide cycles, likely indicating increased deposition during periods with calm waters and increased suspension when water was more turbulent, but did not vary at greater depths in the sediment. Individual microplastics particles were also larger during neap versus spring tide periods. In contrast to the variation between spring and neap tide periods, we found no variation in the abundance of microplastics on the semidiurnal scale. Microplastics were also more abundant in the transect in the vegetation than at slightly lower elevations in the adjacent mudflat. Across all samples, the abundance of microplastics was negatively correlated with the strength of hydrological processes such as submergence time and flow velocity. Our results showed that sampling of microplastics in the intertidal environment needs to consider variation among spring and neap tide cycles, and also among different intertidal habitats that may differ only slightly in elevation. We encourage coupling sampling with direct measures of hydrological processes so that variation in microplastics abundance and size can be rigorously linked to hydrological processes. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

Despite the ecological relevance of these surveys, no information has been available until now about the hazard related to plastic mixtures in freshwaters. To fill this knowledge gap, we carried out a study aimed to assess the environmental risk associated with the ?€?cocktail?€? of plastics and environmental pollutants adsorbed on their surface in one of the larger European freshwater basins. Plastic debris was collected by a manta trawl along one transect each in four of the Italian subalpine great lakes (Lake Maggiore, Como, Iseo and Garda) and administered to zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), a useful freshwater biological model present in all these lakes. We estimated a plastic density from 4908 MPs/km2 (Lake Iseo) to 272,261 MPs/km2 (Lake Maggiore), while the most common polymers found were polyethylene and polypropylene, with percentages varying between 73% and 100%. A biomarkers suite consisting of 10 different endpoints was performed after 7 days of exposure to investigate the molecular and cellular effects of plastics and related adsorbed pollutants. The main results highlighted a diffuse but different toxicity due to plastics for each lake, and there were significant changes in the antioxidant and detoxifying enzyme activities in Lake Maggiore, Iseo and Garda, an increase in protein carbonylation in L. Como, and a cellular viability decrease of approximately 30% for zebra mussels from L. Iseo and Garda.

Demographic data showed that the population had a sex ratio of 1.00:1.21 (males:females), high BMI values and up to 40% of females were lactating when captured. Related to diet data, the composition was mainly the same as previous studies around its natural and introduced distribution area.

Thus, it is shown how an opportunistic omnivorous species has adapted to the resources provided by the island. Cultivated plants' remains and plastic content in diet evidence that P. lotor is entering in contact with human settlements and agricultural areas. As occurred in other islands where P. lotor was introduced, it is expected that it could become a future problem for the conservation biodiversity in insular ecosystems, as well as for agriculture and human activity.

Increased trophodynamics and the potential for the accumulation of semi-buoyant microplastic particles at aggregation zones may present a pathway of increased exposure for microplastic to enter the estuarine trophic system via ingestion by zooplankton. Optical and fluorescence microscopy were used to enumerate microplastic fiber and fragment concentrations, with melting point analysis applied for confirmation, in water sieved (sized 43?€?104 ??m) from the upper meter of the water column at positions across tidal fronts. The Cooper River front contained significantly higher microplastic water concentrations, dominated by fragments, on the riverside and within the frontal zone versus the seaward side, indicating an input of microplastic from land-based sources. No significant increase in abundance of zooplankton was found within the Cooper River or Ashley River fronts. Microplastic in the gut of field-collected zooplankton was observed using fluorescence microscopy. Only zooplankton from the Cooper River were observed with ingested microplastic. Absence of detection in zooplankton from the Ashley River may be due to fibers being more prevalent than fragments in surface waters at that front. On average, 1% of the filter-feeding zooplankton observed contained ingested microplastic particles suggesting zooplankton may be selectively feeding. Although the fraction was small, it represents significant exposure to microplastic for pelagic fish species that may be feeding at flood-tidal fronts in Charleston Harbor. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

The benefits of plastics in society are unquestionable, but there is an urgent need to better manage their value chain. The recently adopted European Strategy for Plastics stressed the need to tackle the challenges related to plastics with a focus on plastic litter including microplastics. Microplastics have been detected mainly in the marine environment, but also in freshwater, soil and air. Based on today?€?s knowledge they may also be present in food products. Although nanoplastics have not yet been detected, it can be assumed that they are also present in the environment. This emerging issue presents challenges to better understand future research needs and the appropriate immediate actions to be taken to support the necessary societal and policy initiatives. It has become increasingly apparent that a broad and systematic approach is required to achieve sustainable actions and solutions along the entire supply chain. It is recognised that there is a pressing need for the monitoring of the environment and food globally. However, despite the number of research projects increasing, there is still a lack of suitable and validated analytical methods for detection and quantification of micro- and nanoplastics. There is also a lack of hazard and fate data which would allow for their risk assessment. Some priorities are identified in this paper to bridge the knowledge gaps for appropriate management of these challenges. At the same time it is acknowledged that there is a great complexity in the challenges that need to be tackled before a really comprehensive environmental assessment of plastics, covering their entire life cycle, will be possible. ?? 2019, ?? 2019 The Author(s).

X886GHB2,10.1080/01584197.2019.1659105,Seashell and debris ingestion by African penguins,"African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) are pursuit-diving seabirds endemic to the coast of southern Africa. In this study, we investigate the presence of seashells and anthropogenic debris (e.g. plastic, glass, nylon) in the stomach contents of adult African penguins, as determined from sampling of live penguins through the water off-loading technique (n = 4,793) and from post-mortem examination of penguin carcases (n = 159). Seashells were present in stomach contents sampled from 106 live (2.2%) and three dead (1.9%) penguins. Seashells originated from a variety of intertidal and subtidal organisms including molluscs, barnacles and bryozoans, and the eroded condition of the shell fragments suggests that they were picked up from shell deposits on the beach or in the surf zone. Seashell ingestion appears to be more frequent in the months of peak egg laying. A subset of stomach samples from known-sex individuals revealed that seashells were only present in the stomachs of adult females. In post-mortem examination, the presence of seashells in the stomach was accompanied by anatomical evidence that egg laying was imminent or had recently occurred. Anthropogenic debris was found in one (0.6%) and eight (0.2%) stomach content samples obtained from dead and live penguins, respectively. In some cases, the ingestion of anthropogenic debris co-occurred with that of seashells, and their size and shape were similar. Our findings demonstrate that adult female African penguins occasionally ingest seashells, possibly as a calcium supplementation strategy, and raise concern that in doing so they may also accidentally ingest anthropogenic debris. ?? 2019, ?? 2019 BirdLife Australia.",

In this paper, crash absorbers made of recycled carbon staple fibers (rCSF) and polyamide 6 are manufactured by an advanced thermoforming process in a multi-segment mold. The innovative wave design is meant to prevent the crash absorber from unintended crushing effects like bending or buckling and easy to manufacture by the investigated process. The formed crash absorbers were tested in a horizontal test rig by using a crash sled with an impact energy of 1925 J. The rCSF based crash absorbers feature a specific energy absorption (SEA) of 58.12 ?? 0.58 J/g. Also, the standard deviation of the rCSF crash absorbers is remarkably low (1.0%). Thus, rCSF based crash absorbers represent a viable alternative to crash absorbers made of virgin fibers. ?? 2020, ?? 2020 The Author(s).

B8D3DZFB,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.110725,Estimating a regional budget of marine plastic litter in order to advise on marine management measures,"Using simple models, coupled with parameters extracted from published studies, the annual inputs of macro and micro plastics to the Scottish Atlantic Coast and the Scottish North Sea Coast regions are estimated. Two estimates of land-based sources are used, scaled by catchment area population size. The oceanic supply of floating plastic is estimated for wind-driven and general circulation sources. Minimum, typical and maximum values are computed to examine the magnitude of uncertainties. Direct inputs from fishing and the flux of macroplastic onto the seabed are also included. The modelled estimates reveal the importance of local litter sources to Scottish coastal regions, and hence local management actions can be effective. Estimates provide a scale against which removal efforts may be compared, and provide input data for future more complex modelling. Recommendations for research to improve the preliminary estimates are provided. Methods presented here may be useful elsewhere. ?? 2019",
4F3RNJFN,10.1016/j.watres.2019.115121,The ocean's ultimate trashcan: Hadal trenches as major depositories for plastic pollution,"Plastic debris and marine microplastics are being discharged into the ocean at an alarming scale and have been observed throughout the marine environment. Here we report microplastic in sediments of the Challenger Deep, the deepest known region on the planet, abyssal plains and hadal trenches located in the Pacific Ocean (4900 m?€?10,890 m). Microplastic abundance reached 71.1 items per kg dry weight sediment. That high concentrations are found at such remote depths, knowing the very slow sinking speed of microplastics, suggests that supporting mechanisms must be at-play. We discuss cascading processes that transport microplastics on their journey from land and oceanic gyres through intermediate waters to the deepest corners of the ocean. We propose that hadal trenches will be the ultimate sink for a significant proportion of the microplastics disposed in the ocean. The build-up of microplastics in hadal trenches could have large consequences for fragile deep-sea ecosystems. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
DHRXAL54,10.1007/s00244-015-0216-x,Microplastics in the Ocean,"Since their ubiquity in the ocean and marine organisms was first revealed, global concern about microplastics has grown considerably. The North Pacific Ocean and the adjacent marginal seas have high levels of microplastic contamination compared with the global average. This special issue on microplastics was organized by the North Pacific Marine Science Organization to share information on microplastic pollution in the North Pacific region. The special issue highlights high levels of contamination in the North Pacific both on shorelines and at the sea surface. Particularly high levels of contamination were reported on the western and southern coasts of Korea. Sources, including sewage discharge, aquaculture, and shipyards, were implicated. With the direction and energy of surface winds and currents have an important influence on shoreline patterns of distribution. The special issue also demonstrates potential for ingestion of microplastic by small planktonic organisms at the base of the food chain. A wide range of chemicals are associated with plastic debris and concerns are expressed about the potential for these chemicals to transfer to biota upon ingestion. As an introduction to the topic, this paper provides a brief background on microplastic contamination, highlights some key research gaps, and summarizes findings from the articles published in this issue. ?? 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York",
76VC3UHH,10.1007/s00244-015-0172-5,Ingestion of Microplastics by Zooplankton in the Northeast Pacific Ocean,"Microplastics are increasingly recognized as being widespread in the world?€?s oceans, but relatively little is known about ingestion by marine biota. In light of the potential for microplastic fibers and fragments to be taken up by small marine organisms, we examined plastic ingestion by two foundation species near the base of North Pacific marine food webs, the calanoid copepod Neocalanus cristatus and the euphausiid Euphausia pacifia. We developed an acid digestion method to assess plastic ingestion by individual zooplankton and detected microplastics in both species. Encounter rates resulting from ingestion were 1 particle/every 34 copepods and 1/every 17 euphausiids (euphausiids &gt; copepods; p = 0.01). Consistent with differences in the size selection of food between these two zooplankton species, the ingested particle size was greater in euphausiids (816 ?? 108 ??m) than in copepods (556 ?? 149 ??m) (p = 0.014). The contribution of ingested microplastic fibres to total plastic decreased with distance from shore in euphausiids (r2 = 70, p = 0.003), corresponding to patterns in our previous observations of microplastics in seawater samples from the same locations. This first evidence of microplastic ingestion by marine zooplankton indicate that species at lower trophic levels of the marine food web are mistaking plastic for food, which raises fundamental questions about potential risks to higher trophic level species. One concern is risk to salmon: We estimate that consumption of microplastic-containing zooplankton will lead to the ingestion of 2?€?7 microplastic particles/day by individual juvenile salmon in coastal British Columbia, and ???91 microplastic particles/day in returning adults. ?? 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York",

BCBWBN5J,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.110712,Can microplastics pose a threat to ocean carbon sequestration?,"Global climate change has attracted worldwide attention. The ocean is the largest active carbon pool on the planet and plays an important role in global climate change. However, marine plastic pollution is getting increasingly serious due to the large consumption and mismanagement of global plastics. The impact of marine plastics on ecosystem responsible for the gas exchange and circulation of marine CO2 may cause more greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, in this paper, threats of marine microplastics to ocean carbon sequestration are discussed. Marine microplastics can 1) affect phytoplankton photosynthesis and growth; 2) have toxic effects on zooplankton and affect their development and reproduction; 3) affect marine biological pump; and 4) affect ocean carbon stock. Phytoplankton and zooplankton are the most important producer and consumer of the ocean. As such, clearly, further research should be needed to explore the potential scale and scope of this impact, and its underlying mechanisms. ?? 2019",

In the southeastern US, the filter-feeding Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is susceptible to microplastic ingestion. We quantified the distribution of microplastics within adult oysters (harvestable size >7.5 cm) from 28 reefs throughout a rural estuary with limited riverine inputs (St. Catherines Sound, Georgia). To determine which variables best predict microplastic concentration in oysters, we also quantified oyster recruitment, distance to ocean, fetch, and water body width. Oysters averaged 0.72 microplastic particles per individual (0.18 particles per gram wet mass); microfragments and microplastics were equally abundant. Although microplastic concentrations were low, multivariate models identified a positive effect of water body width on the site-level concentration of plastic microfibers; average microfragment length was affected by fetch. Our work informs a growing understanding of microplastic distribution in coastal estuaries, providing an important rural contrast to the urbanized estuaries that have been examined. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

An investigation into the long-term variation of microplastic accumulation in sediment cores is essential for understanding the historical trend of this contamination and its response to human activities. In this study, the multidecadal changes of microplastic abundances in two sediment cores from the inner shelf of the East China Sea (ECS) were revealed by two methods, i.e., a visual enumeration method based on scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and a quantitative method based on microplastic-derived carbon (MPC) abundances. The features of microplastics were determined via SEM-EDS and micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (??-FTIR). The results reveal a multidecadal increasing trend of microplastic accumulation in the coastal sediments of the ECS since the 1960s, which may be jointly governed by the release of plastic wastes and oceanographic dynamics. Meanwhile, the breakpoint of the exponential growth of microplastics in the ECS occurs in 2000 AD, which well matches the rapid increasing of plastic production and consumption in China. Further, based on the MPC contents in sediments, the influence of microplastics on the quantitative evaluation of carbon storage in the ECS has been examined for the first time, revealing an insignificant (<2% before 2014 AD) but potentially-increasing (6.8% by 2025 AD) contribution of microplastics to carbon burial.

NL43H3J3,,Preliminary study on the microplastic contamination of beach sand from eastern Thailand,"Microplastics (&lt; 5 mm) are a major environmental issue due to their ubiquitous distribution in the environment. A range of studies have found significant levels in beach sand worldwide. Microplastics originate from inland and /or ocean-based sources and are due to years of improper disposal of plastic materials, mismanagement and negligent littering. Beaches are considered the most suitable environment on earth for plastic degradation. Beach clean-ups, while being a direct and effective mitigation measure, usually focus on larger particles, ignoring smaller plastics that fragment into microplastics, which can physically and chemically harm wildlife via ingestion, consequently posing a long-term threat to the marine ecosystem.

Microplastics can affect all marine life via the food web, from primary producers (e.g., microalgae) to final consumers (e.g., carnivorous fish). Thus, several studies have attempted to evaluate microplastic toxicity, but information about the underlying mechanisms of their effect is limited. Therefore, in this study, we examined multiple factors that could contribute to microplastic-induced toxicity. We investigated the potential molecular effects of microplastic size and exposure time. We exposed the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus to 50 nm and 10 ??m polystyrene microbeads. We found that both size and exposure time increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species.

F9TQW5E2,10.5334/aogh.2831,Human health and ocean pollution,"Background: Pollution ?€? unwanted waste released to air, water, and land by human activity ?€? is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today. It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources ?€? coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children?€?s risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals ?€? phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste ?€? can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South ?€? environmental injustice on a planetary scale. Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth?€?s resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries. Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas. ?? 2020 The Author(s).",

The presence of microplastics in all waters tested suggests it should now be classed as an emergent contaminant, with routine monitoring required. ?? the Author(s), 2019.",

The highest microplastics density was found in coastal stations near urbanized sites, large tropical estuaries, and fishing grounds. With regard to microplastics composition, most of the identified particles were fibers/filaments, styrofoam, hard and soft plastic, paint, and glass/acrylic. Fibers/filaments were the most abundant ( 80%) and occurred at all stations, in both types of mesh nets. Hard plastic particles were frequent (78%) only in the 120 ??m mesh net. The mean density recorded in the 120 ??m mesh net was about seven times greater than that in the 300 ??m mesh net, suggesting that the larger mesh size net did not lead to an accurate description of microplastics density in the pelagic environment or the degree of risk to which organisms are exposed. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

We conducted a large-scale investigation of microplastic pollution across the Greater Melbourne Area and the Western Port area, Australia, spanning gradients of land-use from un-developed catchments in conservation areas to more heavily-developed areas. Microplastics were detected in 94% of water samples and 96% of sediment samples, with abundances ranging from 0.06 to 2.5 items/L in water and 0.9 to 298.1 items/kg in sediment. The variation of microplastic abundance in sediments was closely related to that of the overlying waters. Fiber was the most abundant (89.1% and 68.6% of microplastics in water and sediment respectively), and polyester was the dominant polymer in water and sediment. The size of more than 40% of all total microplastics observed was less than 1 mm. Both light and dense polymers of different shapes were more abundant in sediments than those in water, indicating that there is microplastic accumulation in sediments. The abundance of microplastics was higher near coastal cities than at less densely-populated inland areas. A spatial analysis of the data suggests that the abundance of microplastics increases downstream in rivers and accumulates in estuaries and the lentic reaches of these rivers. Correlation and redundancy analysis were used to explore the associations between microplastic pollution and different land-use types. More microplastics and polymer types were found at areas with large amounts of commercial, industrial and transport activities. Microplastic abundances were also correlated with mean particle size. Microplastic hotspots within a coastal metropolis might be caused by a combination of natural accumulation via hydrological dynamics and contribution from increasing anthropogenic influences. Our results strongly suggest that coastal metropolis superimposed on increasing microplastic levels in waterbodies from inland areas to the estuaries and open oceans. ?? 2019 A coastal metropolis first receives microplastic inputs from upstream then magnifies its abundance and transportation via urban activities. ?? 2019",
LKKUVSDX,10.1021/acs.est.9b07705,Benthic Crustacean Digestion Can Modulate the Environmental Fate of Microplastics in the Deep Sea,"Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous contaminants of the marine environment, and the deep seafloor is their ultimate sink compartment. Manipulative and field experiments provided evidence of the ingestion of MPs by deep-sea fauna, but knowledge of MPs' fate once ingested still remains scant. We provide evidence of MP partial retention and fragmentation mediated by digestion activity of a Norwegian langoustine, a good bioindicator for MP contamination of the deep sea. We report here that MPs in the intestines were more abundant and significantly smaller (up to 1 order of magnitude in surface) than those in the stomachs. Our results show that the stomach can act as a size-bottleneck for ingested MPs, enhancing the retention of larger particles within the stomach and promoting fragmentation into smaller plastic debris, which is then released in the intestine. Our results provide evidence that the langoustine is responsible for the fragmentation of MPs already accumulated in sediments through its scavenging activity and digestion. These findings highlight the existence of a new peculiar kind of ""secondary"" MPs, introduced in the environment by biological activities, which could represent a significant pathway of plastic degradation in a secluded and stable environment such as the deep sea. ?? 2020 American Chemical Society.",

A subsurface pump system and a Manta net were used for seawater filtration. Twenty-seven samples were visually analyzed with a microscope. It was found that almost every subsurface sample contained potentially plastic particles, which were classified according to their type and size. Plastic fragments were more commonly found in the samples taken from the surface. In the subsurface layer, the majority of the detected particles were fibers. These results also indicate that minimal concentrations of plastics tend to be found near the equator and to the north of the Canary Islands. The maximum microplastic concentrations were found in tropical zones. The obtained results are in good agreement with previous models and field studies. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In particular, nanoplastics and microplastics (NMPs) are attracting global attention due to their potential impact on aquatic organisms. Here, we examined the effects of NMPs (50 nm polystyrene microbead nanoplastics [NPs] and 45 ??m microplastics [MPs]) on oxidative status and gut microbiota in the marine medaka Oryzias melastigma. The NP-exposed group exhibited stronger oxidative stress with higher activation levels of antioxidants compared to the MP-exposed group. However, the MP-exposed group demonstrated induction of intestinal damage (e.g., increased mucus ratio) with further alterations of gut microbiota, compared to the NP-exposed group. In particular, MPs caused more significant alterations of microbiota composition at both phylum and genus levels. Thus, in this study we show distinct toxicity pathways of NPs and MPs, an oxidative stress-mediated pathway (e.g., antioxidants) induced by NP exposure and dysbiosis of gut microbiota in association with immune dysfunction induced by MP exposure. Our results are helpful for expanding our knowledge about the impacts of NMPs as potentially harmful substances in the aquatic environment. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

2VDQHJDE,,Prediction of ocean debris drift trajectory and recovery range using a coupled numerical model,"Marine waste is now a global problem, especially for plastic bottles and plastic waste that are hard to decompose. These wastes not only put marine life at risk, but also damage the health of marine ecosystems. In order to understand the immediate drift and distribution of marine garbage so as to better manage marine garbage, the numerical study on the ocean debris drift in the western part of the Bohai sea is conducted in this paper. The influence of prominent factors, such as wind speed, wind direction, and garbage source, on the drift trajectory and range has been examined and discussed in detail. Furthermore, the marine garbage treatment program is analyzed. It is found that the topographical features of the location of the ocean waste source affect not only the length of the particle's final drift trajectory but also the particle's diffusion. The increase of wind speed will cause the accumulation of the marine debris, and the change of wind direction will periodically affect the drift distance and diffusion area of particles.

The ingestion rate and degree of impact is species-specific and depends on food preferences, foraging behaviour, and plastic pollution of the area. Currently there is a large knowledge gap regarding ingestion of marine litter by invertebrates in brackish water bodies. Therefore, experiments were conducted to investigate microplastics uptake and potential accumulation in the digestive system of the Harris mud crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii. Effects of microplastics on the growth of crabs were also tested. The results show that R. harrisii consume microplastics together with food, only plastic fragments too large for the digestion system were removed by crabs. The effect and duration of passage of plastic are not consistent and depend on the size and type of plastic. Microplastic fragments (<0.25 mm) ingested by crab were continuously egested while knotted fibres may accumulate in the stomach. The crabs fed with plastic supplements lost weight or had lower weight increase compared to control group after two??month treatment. However, the differences between treatments were not statistically significant. For the first time, occurrence of plastic in the digestive system of crabs collected from the natural habitats of P??rnu Bay (NE Baltic Sea, Estonia) was studied.

However, very little is known about the presence of MPs in higher trophic level species, including cetaceans. We worked with community based monitors and Inuvialuit hunters from Tuktoyaktuk (Northwest Territories, Canada) to sample seven beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) in 2017 and 2018. Microplastics were detected in the gastrointestinal tracts in every whale. We estimate that each whale contained 18 to 147 MPs in their GI tract (average of 97 ?? 42 per individual). FTIR-spectroscopy revealed over eight plastic polymer types, with nearly half being polyester. Fibres made up 49% of MPs. The diversity of MP shapes and polymeric identities in beluga points to a complex source scenario, and ultimately raises questions regarding the significance and long-term exposure of this pollutant in this ecologically and culturally valuable species. ?? 2019",

UIBIP6VC,,Plastic debris in waves: An experimental study,"Plastic waste in the ocean is one of the most consequential issues of humankind. Statistics show that approximately 12 million tons of plastic are dumped into the ocean and a total of 268,940 tons of plastic consisting of 5.25 trillion particles are distributed over the surface every single year (Jambeck, 2015). However, little knowledge has been acquired about the effect of local wave on plastic particle movement. In this study, the issue of local wave effect has been studied to investigate the trajectories and distribution of the plastic particles on the free water surface. A series of model tests have been performed. For regular wave tests, factors including a single and a flock plastic, different frequencies are considered, and for irregular wave tests, five different sea states are taken into consideration. The experimental results showed a correlation between the wave frequency and the final position of the plastic particles. Specifically speaking, under the circumstance of fixed altitude, when the frequency is higher than 1.2Hz, the majority of the particles will end up on shore, and a higher frequency will lead to a faster landing. Similar phenomenon was observed in the irregular wave test, where the possibility of landing at lower sea states are higher than that at higher sea states. Results and observations gained from this research can contribute to our understanding of the marine pollution issue and help predicting the landing time of waste in coastal area as well as creating a more accurate estimation of the distribution of ocean plastic in seabed. ?? 2020 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).",
X3DKVLWD,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124560,Physical interactions between marine phytoplankton and PET plastics in seawater,"Plastics are the most abundant marine debris globally dispersed in the oceans and its production is rising with documented negative impacts in marine ecosystems. However, the chemical-physical and biological interactions occurring between plastic and planktonic communities of different types of microorganisms are poorly understood. In these respects, it is of paramount importance to understand, on a molecular level on the surface, what happens to plastic fragments when dispersed in the ocean and directly interacting with phytoplankton assemblages. This study presents a computer-aided analysis of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of selected spin probes able to enter the phyoplanktonic cell interface and interact with the plastic surface. Two different marine phytoplankton species were analyzed, such as the diatom Skeletonema marinoi and dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum, in absence and presence of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fragments in synthetic seawater (ASPM), in order to in-situ characterize the interactions occurring between the microalgal cells and plastic surfaces. The analysis was performed at increasing incubation times. The cellular growth and adhesion rates of microalgae in batch culture medium and on the plastic fragments were also evaluated. The data agreed with the EPR results, which showed a significant difference in terms of surface properties between the diatom and dinoflagellate species. Low-polar interactions of lipid aggregates with the plastic surface sites were mainly responsible for the cell-plastic adhesion by S. marinoi, which is exponentially growing on the plastic surface over the incubation time. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

This study presents physical and chemical characterizations of microplastic debris and a comparison between the spatial distribution and anthropogenic activities in 4 Panamanian beaches located in both sides of the Isthmus. Two of them (Juan Diaz and San Carlos beaches) are located toward the Pacific Ocean, Panam?? Province, whereas the others (Palenque and Punta Galeta beaches) are located at the Caribbean Sea, Col??n Province. They were chosen to show different landscape management and environmental impacts: touristic and protected areas; coastal areas that receive pollutants and marine litter from urban rivers or are used for local fishing activities. Plastic debris samples were collected and visually analyzed following the protocol proposed by the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP). The physical characterization of the samples consisted in the determination of variables associated with the number of plastic particles, shape, color, and size. The characterization of the polymers was performed by the attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy technique. A high concentration of microplastics (353 items/m2) were found at the studied sites at the Caribbean coast, whereas a lesser concentration with a greater diversity of shapes and polymer categories were found at the Pacific Coast (187 items/m2). The results indicate that, in addition to anthropogenic activities, the proximity to Panama Canal installations, as well as seasonality, natural phenomena, winds, and ocean currents may be influencing the increase in microplastic contents and the types of polymers observed. ??

Macro-samples were prepared from brittle not-buoyant PS (disposable plates), flexible thin film of LDPE (garbage bags), highly buoyant foamed PS (building insulation sheets), and hard buoyant PP (single-use beverage cups). With a great variety of behaviors of plastics while mixing, coarser sediments (pebbles) have higher fragmentation efficiency than sands (measured as the mass of generated MPs), disregarding sinking/floating or mechanical properties of the samples. It is confirmed that, under swash-like mixing with coarse sediments, the MPs tend to burry below the sediment surface.

A relationship between microplastic release and parameters from weave design will be established. A fiberglass filter was used to analyze water from the laundry. Results demonstrated that the interlacing coefficient influences the number of particles in the wastewaters. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the higher the density of yarns/cm in the fabric, the lower the quantity of fibers could be found in the wastewater. Results demonstrated that the presence of weave patterns, such as a plain pattern, work better from the sustainability point of view than a twill.

This study provides empirical evidence that a sessile filter feeder, the Blue mussel M. edulis, accelerates microplastic deposition by aggregating them into sinking particulate faeces and pseudofaeces. After settling to the seafloor, the bioturbation of benthic fauna quickly buries these microplastics. Collectively, these results suggest that if such biologically-mediated benthic-pelagic coupling would be integrated into hydrodynamic transport models, the spatial variability and source-sink dynamics of microplastics would be better understood. It is proposed that microplastic pollution is monitored through sampling that takes into account faeces and pseudofaeces underneath filter feeders. The implications of this detrital pathway for microplastic transfer to the seafloor, and the role of shellfish mariculture in this process, are discussed. Studies that consider filter feeders and benthic communities from other regions, and during different seasons, are needed to validate the proposed biological pump mechanism across space and time. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd Summary: Particulate filter feeding organisms greatly enhance the transfer of microplastics from the pelagic environment to the seafloor.

The occurrence of MPs in edible salts and their extraction procedure is limited. In this work, we have developed a facile and cost-effective protocol for the extraction and separation of MPs from the edible salt sample. The visual assessment was performed to identify the shape, size, number, and color of microplastic particles using light and fluorescence microscopy. The composition of the sample was analyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy. A wide range of MPs were found: 1400 ???1900 particles/kg in refined sea salt, 1900 ???2300/kg in unrefined sea salts, and 200 ???400/kg in rock salts. A relatively high number of MPs were found in sea salts rather than rock salts. Sheet type MPs with size 1 ???4??m were observed in rock salts. The most common MPs were polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), nylon, and polystyrene (PS). Further, MPs were effectively removed from synthetic seawater with the help of a microfiltration membrane, which has the capability of arresting the transfer of microplastic particles into edible salts. Therefore the use of MF/UF pretreated brine from seawater desalination plant can be explored for MPs sea salt production at low cost. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

This paper analyses how the ATS has engaged with the issue of plastic waste in general, and marine plastic pollution more particularly, from the entry into force of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty in 1998-2019. Our results indicate that from 2017 the ATS has shown increased attention towards addressing locally sourced marine plastic pollution. A significant problem, however, remains with the respect to marine plastic pollution originating from outside Antarctic Treaty Area that requires a governance response from outside the ATS. ??

Because of their longevity, low density, and small size, MNPs can be transported over long distances by ocean currents, river flows, and wind, resulting in worldwide distribution. In addition, MNPs have a high affinity toward organic contaminants (OCs), including endogenetic OCs known as additives or plastic monomers and exogenetic OCs that are ubiquitous in the environment. Therefore, the transport of MNPs in the environment is accompanied by the immigration of OCs via sorption/desorption, which is designated as the ?€?Trojan-Horse effect?€? of MNPs in this review. The Trojan-Horse effect significantly changes the potential health risks of MNPs via altering the environmental fate and the bioavailability of OCs for living organisms. Although many investigations have been carried out to understand such effect on the accumulation of OCs by organisms, however, most of which have been limited to lab-scale marine environments with distinctly various results under the individual circumstance. Therefore, long-term studies under field environment conditions are urgently needed. In addition, multimedium investigations, i.e., water-soil-plant systems in terrestrial environments, are also critical supplementary for a comprehensive understanding of the Trojan-Horse effect of MNPs in the environment. ?? 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Seabirds have been identified as vectors of chemical contaminants from marine to terrestrial environments, and studies have recently identified seabirds as possible vectors of plastic pollution in the marine environment. However, their role in the distribution of microplastic pollution in the Arctic has yet to be explored. We examined two species of seabirds known to ingest plastics: northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis; n = 27) and thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia; n = 30) as potential vectors for the transport of microplastics in and around breeding colonies. Our results indicated anthropogenic particles in the faecal precursors of both species. Twenty-four anthropogenic particles were found in the fulmar faecal precursor samples (M = 0.89, SD = 1.09; 23 fibres and one fragment), and 10 anthropogenic particles were found in the murre faecal precursor samples (M = 0.33, SD = 0.92; 5 fibres, 4 fragments, and one foam). Through the use of bird population surveys and the quantification of anthropogenic particles found in the faecal precursors of sampled seabirds from the same colony, we estimate that fulmars and murres may deposit between 3.3 (CIboot 1.9 ?? 106?€?4.9 ?? 106) and 45.5 (CIboot 9.1 ?? 106?€?91.9 ?? 106) million anthropogenic particles, respectively, per year into the environment during their breeding period at these colonies. These estimates indicate that migratory seabirds could be contributing to the distribution and local hotspots of microplastics in Arctic environments, however, they are still likely a relatively small source of plastic pollution in terms of mass in the environment and may not contribute as much as other reported sources such as atmospheric deposition in the Arctic. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

We observed high fluctuations in contaminant concentrations in zooplankton between different sampling events. However, the smallest zooplankton size class generally exhibited the highest PAE and OPE concentrations. Field-derived bioconcentration factors (BCFs) showed that certain compounds are prone to bioaccumulate in zooplankton, including some of the most widely used chlorinated OPEs, but with different intensity depending on the zooplankton size-class. The concentration of plastic additives in surface waters and the abundance of microplastic particles were not correlated, implying that they are not necessarily good indicators for each other in this compartment.

However, our understanding of their abundance and distribution characteristics in surface seawater (SSW) remains limited. We investigated microplastics in the surface microlayer (SML) and the SSW at 12 stations near-shore and offshore of the Korean west coast, Incheon/Kyeonggi region. Variation between stations, sampling media, and sampling methods were compared based on abundances, size distribution, and composition profiles of microsized synthetic polymer particles. The abundance of microplastics was greater in the SML (152,688 ?? 92,384 particles/m3) than in SSW and showed a significant difference based on the sampling method for SSWs collected using a hand net (1602 ?? 1274 particles/m3) and a zooplankton trawl net (0.19 ?? 0.14 particles/m3). Ship paint particles (mostly alkyd resin polymer) accounted for the majority of microplastics detected in both SML and SSWs, and increased levels were observed around the voyage routes of large vessels. This indicates that polymers with marine-based origins become an important contributor to microplastics in coastal SSWs of this coastal region. ?? 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York",

We exposed the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to microplastic particles of a mimicked realistic size frequency distribution complemented with serial experiments with distinct size classes. To do so, we exposed this diatom to a concentration series of different sized polyethylene (PE) microbeads (sizes: 10?€?106 ??m; 1.25 ??102?€?1.25 ??107 particles/L) in a 72-h growth inhibition test.

YGV5KRSD,,"Preliminary study on microplastic pollution in surface-water at Tallo and Jeneberang Estuary, Makassar, Indonesia","Microplastic is anthropogenic-based pollution that becomes a global problem, threatening the ecosystem and food security. Microplastic from land-based source can enter the ocean through estuarine waters. Makassar City with a population around 1.7 million people, provides possible sources of microplastic pollution in Makassar Strait through the flow of surrounding rivers, Tallo and Jeneberang in particular. Neuston net method was used to collect 18 surface-water samples from Makassar Estuaries for microplastic analysis. Fish gastrointestinal tracts were collected from 76 pelagic fish in study sites for microplastic analysis, using KOH digestive method. Surface-water samples from both Jeneberang and Tallo river estuaries positively contained microplastic (MPs) particles with abundance of 1.84??0.17 and 1.78??0.25 MPs m-3 respectively. There is no difference between microplastic abundance on both estuaries using t-test statistic, but microplastic from both estuaries, in general, has different characteristics in shape and color. The higher abundance of microplastic in riverine part on both estuaries indicated that microplastic originated from land sources. Pelagic fish from both estuaries were also contained an average of 0.91 to 3.5 MPs individual-1 with more than 50% of contamination level on most species. This result shows that estuary water in Makassar City have been contaminated by microplastic particles and have accumulated to pelagic fish as consumption fish, posing a threat to food safety and human health. ?? 2020, BIOFLUX SRL.

However, current studies have shown that beaches are subject to plastic pollution, one of the most significant global environmental threats. Considering the health of tourists and ecological environmental management of beaches, microplastics on recreational beaches are urgently being studied. This paper first focused on microplastics on the recreational beaches of Haichow Bay, which is located on the central coast of China and faces the Yellow Sea. The microplastic pollution level, occurrence, and distribution were investigated. Our study demonstrated that microplastics were consistently found on all studied beaches, which emphasized their extensive distribution throughout recreational beaches. The average microplastic abundance was 106.50 ?? 34.41 items/kg, demonstrating that the microplastic pollution level on the studied beaches tended to be in the middle-to-low position compared with previous studies. In total, eight colors were found, more than 90% of microplastics were less than 1 mm in size, and fiber and fragments were the dominant shapes. Resort beaches contained the highest number of microplastics, indicating that the microplastic pollution level on recreational beaches was directly related to the tourism intensity. Five types of plastic were found in the samples, i.e., polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), PS (polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and nylon. Land inputs were the main source of pollution. This study provided baseline information on microplastic pollution that can be used for effective and comprehensive management of recreational beaches and suggests that the management of plastic use and recycling on beaches should be integrated into China's?€?coastal zone management practices. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

Seabirds have the most extensive documented history of interactions with plastics, through ingestion, entanglement, and nest construction. In the present study, eight seabird species from the South Pacific Ocean were used as a proxy to determine potential patterns of removal of marine plastic debris, and three hypotheses were tested in relation to their feeding habits and nesting areas. Plastics from abiotic compartments (Chilean continental coast, South Pacific Gyre, and Rapa Nui beaches) and biotic compartments (surface-feeding seabirds, diving seabirds, and nesting areas) were compared, according to their type, colour, shape, and density. Continental beaches had a relatively wide range of colours and shapes, with many non-buoyant plastics. Samples from the South Pacific Gyre (SPG) and Rapa Nui (Easter Island) beaches comprised mainly hard, rounded, buoyant, and white/grey plastics. These results indicate that the composition of floating plastics from terrestrial sources changes during transport with oceanic currents, reducing the proportion of prey-like plastics present in the subtropical gyres. The stomach contents of surface-feeding and diving seabirds were dominated by hard, white/grey, and round plastic items, similar to plastics from the SPG, suggesting non-selective (accidental or secondary) ingestion. Nesting areas had a more variable composition of brightly coloured plastics, suggesting a pattern of selective removal of plastics by seabirds, probably from oceanic sources. The present study reveals extensive interactions of seabirds with plastics on a broader scale, which is highly relevant given that the impacts of plastics on seabirds are increasing worldwide, compromising their efficient conservation. ?? 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Herein we describe a method to detect, identify, and quantify microplastics in marine mussels (Mytilus edulis) using thermal gravimetric analysis ?€? Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy ?€? gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TGA-FTIR-GC/MS) after extracting and isolating the microplastics using chemical digestion, density separation, and filtration. Combining the three instrumental techniques adds discriminatory power as temperature profiles, chromatograms, and vibrational and mass spectra differ among common plastics. First, we tested several digestion schemes after spiking the mussels with plastics commonly found in the marine environment, including polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). KOH (10%, w/v) was the most suitable reagent, providing good recoveries (>97%) without degrading the microplastics. We show that the technique TGA-FTIR-GC/MS can be optimized to readily determine both the type (polymer) and amount (mass) of microplastics in the sample. Applied to 100 mussels from each of six locations along the coast of China, we found an average of 0.58 mg of plastic per kg of tissue (range 0.16?€?1.71 mg/kg), with PE being the most abundant type of plastic measured. Among the coastal cities, mussels from Dalian had the highest microplastic content. Overall, we demonstrate that the method is a powerful technique to quantify masses of microplastics in marine mussels, a species commonly used as a bioindicator of pollution, and may be applied to other biota as well. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In this study, we estimated the abundance of microplastics (particle size < 5 mm) in the beach sediments of southernmost India at Kanyakumari by collecting sediments from harbors, coastal fishing villages/residential beaches, tourist beaches, and undisturbed coastal areas along the Indian Ocean. We recovered 343 particles (67% fiber and 33% fragment) from eight different stations by evaluating 50 g dry sediments (d.s.) from each location. All of them were secondary microplastics and most of them (i.e., 331 out of 343 particles) were transparent. Tourist beaches had the highest concentration (150 particles/50 g d.s.), followed by the harbors (99 particles/50 g d.s.). The undisturbed beach contained the least amount of microplastics, representing only 4.3% of the total recovered particles.

Using industrial methods, three petroleum-based polymers, low-density polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyamide (PA), and the biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) were manufactured in different formularies including conventional and alternative additives, and microplastics of two sizes (<250 and <20 ??m) were obtained with the aim to relate their composition with environmental impact in aquatic environments. Internationally accepted standard tests of regulatory use with marine organisms representative of microalgae (Tisochrysis lutea population growth), crustaceans (Acartia clausi larval survival), and echinoderms (Paracentrotus lividus sea-urchin embryo test) support the following conclusions. Aquatic toxicity of microplastics made from conventional oil-based polymers is due to leaching of chemical additives, and not to ingestion of microplastics. Use of alternative formulations based on natural rather than synthetic chemical additives did not consistently reduce aquatic toxicity except for the replacement of triclosan by the alternative biocide lawsone. In contrast, the biopolymer tested, PHB, seemed to impact marine plankton through different mechanisms associated to the higher abundance of plastic particles within the nanometric range found in this resin and absent in other materials. ?? 2020",

Total metal contents ranged from 3 ??g/kg (5th percentile) up to 7 g/kg (95th percentile). The median content of most metals was below 1 mg/kg and did not exceed legal limits. Iron and zinc were the metals with the highest contents, with medians of approximately 50 mg/kg. Multivariate statistics (k-means clustering and principal component analysis) did not reveal a polymer specific metal composition except for samples of tire tread rubber that was obtained from passenger car tires. Investigation on the potential origin of the metals in plastics revealed that pigments were the most likely source. In comparison to natural and anthropogenic materials in rivers, oceans and air, the metal content of plastic items was within the same order of magnitude, except for antimony and zinc contents. Literature data on the adsorption capacities of plastics suggested that the inherent content of barium, iron, antimony and zinc was dominating the total content in the studied samples. Compared to suspended sediments in rivers, the metal flux into marine environment transported with plastic items was found to be negligible due to the three orders of magnitude lower masses. The different properties, however, may consequently lead to the transport of plastics and their constituents into pristine and remote environments which natural particulate matter may not reach. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

Although ingestion of microplastics (MPs) is abundantly reported, insights into how MP can influence predator-prey interactions currently limits our understanding of the ecological impact of MPs. Here we demonstrate trophic transfer of MPs from zooplankton to benthic filter feeders, through consumption of contaminated prey (i.e. prey with ingested MP). However, predation rates of contaminated prey were significantly lower as compared to predation rates of prey that had no MPs ingested. As filter feeder clearance rates were not affected by consumption of MPs, the lower predation rates of contaminated prey appear to be primarily explained by disruption in zooplankton swimming behaviour that reduces their filtration risk. This is the first study that shows how MPs can change predator-prey interactions that are involved in the coupling between the pelagic and seabed habitat. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd We demonstrate the trophic transfer of MPs from zooplankton to benthic filter feeders, highlighting that the presence of MPs can alter the transfer of energy between trophic levels. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
VTWHBXUR,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970498,SMACC: A System for Microplastics Automatic Counting and Classification,"The management of plastic debris is a serious issue due to its durability. Unfortunately, million tons of plastic end up in the sea becoming one of the biggest current environmental problems. One way to monitor the amount of plastic in beaches is to collect samples and visually count and sort the plastic particles present in them. This is a very time-consuming task. In this work, we present a Computer Vision-based system which is able to automatically count and classify microplastic particles (1-5 mm) into five different visual classes. After cleaning a collected sample in the lab, the proposed system makes use of a pair of its images with different characteristics. The procedure includes a segmentation step, which is based on the Sauvola thresholding method, followed by a feature extraction and classification step. Different features and classifiers are evaluated as well as a deep learning approach. The system is tested on 12 different beach samples with a total of 2507 microplastic particles. The particles of each sample were manually counted and sorted by an expert. This data represents the ground truth, which is compared later with the results of the automatic processing proposals to evaluate their accuracy. The difference in the number of particles is 34 (1.4%) and the error in their classification is less than 4% for all types except for the line shapes particles. These results are obtained in less than half of the time needed by the human expert doing the same task manually. This implies that it is possible to process more than twice as many samples using the same time, allowing the biologists to monitor wider areas and more frequently than doing the process manually. ?? 2013 IEEE.",

A strong agglomeration of PS-COOH (approx. 1 ??m) was observed in natural sea water (NSW) already at time 0, while PS-NH2 resulted still monodispersed (approx. 130 nm) but largely aggregated after 22 h with a microscale dimension similar to those negatively charged. However, their effect on C. robusta embryos development largely differed at 22 h: PS-COOH did not affect larvae phenotypes nor their development, while PS-NH2 caused a dose-dependent effect (EC50 (22 h) of 7.52 ??g mL???1) with various degrees of phenotype malformations (from mild to severe) and impairment of larval swimming. Embryos (up to 30%) exposed to 15 ??g mL???1PS-NH2 resulted not developed and the majority was unable to hatch. Calculated PS-NH2 EC50 resulted higher than those available for other marine invertebrate species, suggesting a protective role of the egg envelopes surrounding C. robusta embryos toward nanoplastics exposure. ?? 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
LG4X3DXH,10.3233/EPL-200201,"Viet Nam: Sources, Impacts and Management of Plastic Marine Debris","Marine environmental pollution caused by plastic wastes has been studied for 50 years, although that research has produced limited recommendations regarding reduction, prevention and control of such wastes. The large annual volume of such pollution enters the marine environment in many ways and lasts a long time, causing harm to marine fauna through entanglement and ingestion of toxic components, which can affect their reproductive capacity and the food chain, and negatively impact human health as well. Viet Nam is fourth in the list of the 20 countries discarding the greatest amounts of plastic waste into the sea on an annual basis. This paper provides an overview of research on the sources of marine plastics pollution, and analyses of its impacts on marine life, marine ecosystems and human health. It briefly reports about the quantity of marine plastic waste that washes up in the coastal region of Viet Nam and offers recommendations to help minimise and manage plastic waste generated by ships. ?? 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

ZCZ2SD94,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111841,Plackett Burman design for microplastics quantification in marine sediments,"Microplastics are gaining worldwide attention due to their omnipresence. The marine environment is one of the most affected systems; especially the sediment compartment. Microplastic separation from the sediment matrix is the first step to evaluate its abundance and availability. Nevertheless, a lack of consistency in extraction protocols is a fact. This paper describes the optimization of the microplastic extraction procedure from marine sediments. The Plackett-Burman saturated factorial design was used to identify the significant factors and to select optimum working conditions. With this purpose, the following variables were studied: the number of extractions; the amount of sediment; the settling time; the density separation solution volume; the agitation time and the suitability of using wet or freeze-dried sediment. The Plackett-Burman design has revealed that the most statistically significant variables were sediment mass and agitation time. The optimized method was applied for two marine sediments collected in the Mar Menor Lagoon. ?? 2020",
Z5B5VYMN,10.1002/aqc.3507,"Assessment of plastic ingestion by pole-caught pelagic predatory fish from O'ahu, Hawai'i","Although the frequency of occurrence of plastic ingestion in the large-sized dolphinfish and tunas taken by the Hawai'i longline fishery is very low (frequency of occurrence < 5% of sampled individuals), the ingestion of plastic in smaller-sized specimens caught with pole-and-line gear by commercial and recreational fishers has not been investigated. This study examined ingestion of >0.25 mm marine plastic debris (MPD) by four predatory fish species caught by commercial fishers around the Main Hawaiian Islands, and documented ingestion in three species: 85.7% of albacore tuna (n = 7), 40.0% of skipjack tuna (n = 10) and 12.5% of dolphinfish (n = 8). Yellowfin tuna (n = 10) did not contain any MPD, probably owing to the high proportion of empty stomachs (60%). For skipjack tuna, the frequency of occurrence of MPD ingestion was significantly higher for the smaller-sized specimens caught with pole-and-line (40%), compared with the larger-sized specimens caught with longlines (0%). For dolphinfish, the frequency of occurrence of MPD ingestion was similar for the similar-sized specimens caught with pole-and-line and with longlines. The ingested MPD items were micro?€?meso plastics, between 1 and 25 mm. While most ingested items were fragments, albacore also ingested line and skipjack also ingested sheets. The predatory fishes ingested light MPD items that float in sea water, but there were species-specific differences in their polymer composition: albacore contained more polypropylene and polyethylene, and skipjack contained more elastomers, characterized by a high percentage of ester plasticizers. Altogether, these results suggest that albacore and skipjack tunas ingest plastic of different types and polymers. Yet more research is needed to understand how differences in vertical distribution, foraging ecology and diet influence the MPD sampled by these predatory fish species. ?? 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The crab Neohelice granulata is considered a key and structuring species in the Bah??a Blanca Estuary (BBE) (SW Atlantic) and its ecological role makes this species especially vulnerable to several pollutants. In this study, male specimens of N. granulata and water samples were collected at three sites in the BBE for the presence of MPs. Different types of MPs were found in all the crabs and the water column samples, although the most frequent were fibers <500?€?1500 ??m, mainly blue. This is the first study to identify MPs in the gills and digestive tract of N. granulata. Moreover, gills presented higher total abundances of MPs than the digestive tract, which suggests that in this case the main uptake of MPs would be by adherence to the gills. ?? 2019",
74RPQG6Q,10.1111/1440-1703.12080,Low-cost microplastic visualization in feeding experiments using an ultraviolet light-emitting flashlight,"Microplastics are pollutants threatening the health of marine, freshwater and terrestrial organisms. To analyze whether an organism is able to ingest microplastics, the organism is usually fed with expensive fluorescent microbeads and placed under a fluorescence microscope for microplastic detection. However, such equipment cannot be afforded by many laboratories. Therefore, we developed a low-cost method to study the ingestion and egestion of low-cost, fluorescent microplastic fragments and fibers by aquatic invertebrates. During our feeding experiments, we exposed the freshwater snail Radix balthica to artificial biofilms containing 15% microplastic fragments and fibers, respectively. We then used an ultraviolet (UV) flashlight to irradiate the microplastics. Hence, we could directly observe the microplastics in the food, during ingestion and egestion as well as in the snail feces. Our method, thereby, allowed us to analyze the snails' behavior (during ingestion and egestion), the microplastics' distribution in the snail feces and the microplastics' shape after the snails' digestion. Furthermore, we observed that the snails ceased to egest microplastics after 76 hr following microplastic ingestion. However, chemical digestion of the snails 6 days after microplastic exposure revealed that microplastics were still present in R. balthica, emphasizing the microplastics' persistence in the animals' bodies. This is the first study combining the usage of low-cost fluorescent microplastics with an inexpensive UV flashlight for microplastic detection during microplastic ingestion and egestion by living organisms. Our new method is not only cost-effective, but also fast and can be performed by a wide range of researchers without special previous training. ?? 2020 The Authors.

However, the effects of MPs on the movement behavior of marine crustacean is poorly understood. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the physiological and behavioral responses of mysid shrimp (Neomysis japonica) larvae to polystyrene (PS) and carboxylated polystyrene (PS?€?COOH). PS-COOH presented a greater physiological toxicity to shrimp larvae compared to PS, causing significant lethal and growth inhibition effect, owing to bioaccumulation of MPs inside stomach. Both two MPs decreased the feeding efficiency of larvae, showing weakened predation competence. Moreover, reduced hunting and/or explorative ability of shrimps caused by MPs was also identified, which was evidenced by an overall decrease in swimming activity, range and frequency after exposure. Our study firstly highlighted that micron-sized polystyrene particles had the negative effects on the movement behavior of mysid shrimp larvae, thus posing potential hazard to population dynamics and ecological function of marine crustacean. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
52HGSJ64,10.33265/polar.v39.3381,Marine debris on two arctic beaches in the Russian far east,"In August 2005, marine debris was counted on two Arctic beaches in the Russian Far East. On the north coast of the Chukchi Peninsula east of Kolyuchin Bay, a beach stretch of ca. 2.4 km held a total of 736 items, 0.024 items m-2, while no more than 0.0011 items m-2, 12 items in total, were found on a beach stretch of ca. 1.2 km on southern Wrangel Island. The likely explanation for this difference is that the area around the mainland beach is ice-free for a longer period each year, but a contributing factor may be that late spring ice movement removed plastic from the beach on Wrangel Island. The language on the few items with identifiable labels was for the most part Russian or English, making the Chukchi Sea a possible source region. Beaches at the same latitude in the Atlantic may hold more debris on account of the higher human population density, more shipping and transport of floating debris unhindered by a narrow strait that is ice-covered much of the year. Fishing gear blown across the tundra is suggested as a potential threat to reindeer and other terrestrial wildlife. ?? 2020 H. Kylin.",

Microfibres are among the most pervasive pollutants in the marine environment, including in the Southern Ocean. However, evidence for microfibre contamination in the diet of top predators in the Southern Ocean is rare. King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) feed on mesopelagic fish, which undergo diel vertical migrations towards the surface at night. Microfibres are concentrated in surface waters and sediments but can also be concentrated in fish, therefore acting as contamination vectors for diving predators feeding at depth. In this study, we investigate microfibre contamination of King Penguin faecal samples collected in February and March 2017 at South Georgia across three groups: incubating, chick-rearing and non-breeding birds. After a KOH digestion to dissolve the organic matter and a density separation step using a NaCl solution, the samples were filtered to collect microfibres. A total of 77% of the penguin faecal samples (36 of 47) contained microfibres. Fibres were measured and characterized using Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy to determine their polymeric identity. Most fibres (88%) were made of natural cellulosic materials (e.g. cotton, linen), with only 12% synthetic (e.g. polyester, nylon) or semi-synthetic (e.g. rayon). An average of 21.9 ?? 5.8 microfibres g???1 of faeces (lab dried mass) was found, with concentrations more than twice as high in incubating penguins than in penguins rearing chicks. Incubating birds forage further north at the Antarctic Polar Front and travel longer distances from South Georgia than chick-rearing birds. This suggests that long-distance travelling penguins are probably more exposed to the risk of ingesting microfibres when feeding north of the Antarctic Polar Front, which might act as a semi-permeable barrier for microfibres. Microfibres could therefore provide a signature for foraging location in King Penguins. ?? 2019 The Authors",

The monitoring system can realize in-situ real-time detection and nondestructive testing, which provide a large amount of Raman spectroscopy of MP for Marine environmental analysis. A database suitable for microplastics analysis was presented based on the characteristic of Raman spectroscopy. Extra Trees algorithm was presented for the automatic identification of MP in this paper. The algorithm network is trained to detect random MP based on the established database, which including pure MP and mixed MP. The experiment result shows that several MP samples, including pure polystyrene (PS), Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), Polyamide (PA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polypropylene (PP) could be individually and automatically identified. The experiment result demonstrated that over 98.82% mixed particles could be correctly identified. The results were consistent with Extra Trees model built for identifying six types of MP, indicating Extra Trees model was highly robust for more than six of MP detection.

One of these is the consequences of the improper discarding of plastic in the environment and its eventual fragmentation into microplastics. Plastic can reach rivers and affect their biota as microparticles from its degradation. The entry of plastic into the food chain occurs by the consumption of fish or other organisms. Furthermore, persistent organic pollutants can accumulate, and the consumption of materials containing plastic pollutants can cause several physiological problems in animals. Such pollutants can reach man when water or fish is consumed. There are numerous studies in the marine environment that show that microplastics significantly interfere with marine biota; but there are relatively few studies addressing this topic in freshwater environments. This work characterized the diet of the most abundant fish species in an urban river of the Upper Paran?? Brazil Watershed, investigating the occurrence of microplastic. As much as the studied river suffers from urban river syndrome, a wide variety of food consumed by fish was found. The stomach content of 220 individuals belonging to fourteen species was analyzed. In the stomach content analysis, 16 types of food items were found, most of them autochthonous. The species analyzed were grouped into four trophic categories, with iliophage as dominant one. The presence of microplastics was found in 2% of the studied individuals, two individuals of the species Rhamdia quelen, one specimen of Hoplosternum littorale and one specimen of Astyanax fasciatus. ?? 2020, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

At present, the physical and chemical effects of environmental MPs on aquatic organisms are poorly documented. This study aims to examine the physiological and behavioral effects caused by fish consuming environmental microplastics at different life stages. MP samples were collected from beaches on three islands (Easter Island, Guam and Hawaii) located near the North and South gyres of the Pacific Ocean. Larvae and juveniles of Japanese Medaka were fed for 30 days with three doses of MPs (0.01, 0.1 and 1% w/w in fish food) approximate to the concentrations measured in moderately and heavily contaminated ocean areas. Ingestion of MPs by medaka larvae caused (variously) death, decreased head/body ratios, increased EROD activity and DNA breaks and, alterations to swimming behavior. A diet of 0.1% MPs was the most toxic. Two-month-old juveniles fed with 0.01% MPs did not exhibit any symptoms except an increase in DNA breaks. Our results demonstrate ingestion and mainly sublethal effects of environmental MPs in early life stages of fish at realistic MP concentrations.

Among marine plastic waste, a particularly troublesome waste fraction is Abandoned, Lost or Discarded Fishing Gears (ALDFG) that continues to trap marine life for years upon releaseand has significant adverse environmental effects on coastal and marine ecosystems. However, lack of scientific data on the estimated contribution of ALDFG to marine plastics and associated reasoning hinders the management of fishing gear resources across the globe. This study presents a system-wide analysis of the typical fishing gears used in Norway for commercial fishing, i.e. trawls, seines (Danish and Purse), longlines, gillnets, and traps. Based on data from gear producers, suppliers, fishers, collectors, authorities, and waste management facilities, we model the flows of plastics polymers, polypropylene, polyethylene, and Nylon, used as the building blocks of advanced gears. A static Material Flow Analysis (MFA) is used to understand life cycle processes and further monitor gear quantities in and between the processes in the system. Our findings indicate that commercial fishing in Norway contributes to around 380 t/yr. mass of plastics from lost fishing gears and parts. Gillnets, longlines, and traps are the main contributors to ALDFG in the ocean due to gear design, practice, and ground deployment. Additionally, around 4000 tons of plastic waste is collected in Norway annually from derelict fishing gears out of which 24% is landfilled, and 21% is incinerated for energy recovery. The MFA approach shows significant potential as a holistic decision support tool for industry and policy-makers in exercising sustainable fishing gear resource management. The study also generates key evidence on regional level plastic pollution from the fishing sector and highlights possible mechanisms that may aid in proposed improvements. ?? 2019 The Author(s)",

Yet, there are few studies on estuarine organisms. This baseline study evaluates the abundance and distribution of microplastics in the gastropods of a tropical estuary in Selangor, Malaysia. The abundance of microplastics ranged from 0.50 to 1.75 particles/g or from 0.25 to 0.88 particles/individual. The variation in microplastic distribution between the upper and lower estuary indicates that the microplastics originated from the urbanised area of the Klang River estuary. Microplastic sizes varied from 30 to 1850 ??m, with the majority being between 300 and 1000 ??m (57%). Characteristics of microplastics were dominant for fibres (91%) with black colour (50%).

Neustonic microplastics and zooplankton (0.33?€?2 mm) were collected using a 330-??m mesh Manta trawl in Geoje eastern Bay and Jinhae Bay before and after the rainy season in 2012 and 2013. The mean microplastic to zooplankton ratios were 0.086 (May) and 0.022 (July) in 2012, and 0.016 (June) and 0.004 (July) in 2013, indicating that zooplanktivores could be more likely to feed on microplastics than natural preys before the rainy season in 2012 and 2013. In particular, the relatively high ratio occurred in a semi-enclosed bay characterized by a shipyard and a beach resort in Geoje Bay, and at stations close to a wastewater treatment plant and an aquaculture facility in Jinhae Bay before the rainy season. Among dominant microplastics and zooplankton before the rainy season, meroplankton of macrobenthos could be confused with paint particles in Geoje Bay, 2012, whereas Styrofoam could be mistaken as immature copepods by predators in Jinhae Bay, 2013. These observations suggest that zooplanktivores could be more likely to feed on microplastics than natural preys around Geoje and Jinhae Bays before the rainy season. ?? 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York",

However, the levels of additives retained in marine plastic fragments have rarely been assessed. In this study, 141 plastic fragments from a beach in Kauai were analyzed piece-by-piece for 12 compounds, including UV stabilizers and brominated flame retardants. UV stabilizers (UV-326, UV-328, UV-327, and BP-12) were found in 13% of ?€?small?€? fragments (4?€?7 mm) with levels of up to 315 ??g/g and in 33% of ?€?large?€? fragments (15?€?80 mm) with levels of up to 1130 ??g/g. This observation suggests that exhaustive leaching of additives does not occur during fragmentation and that significant levels of additives, comparable to those of the original products, can be retained in fragments of marine plastic, indicating their importance as a vector of chemical additive exposure. ?? 2019",

The degradation of OXO-PE, PE and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was compared at two depths (2 m and 6 m) in the Arabian Gulf. Scanning electron microcopy (SEM) revealed more fissure formation on OXO-PE and PE than on PET, indicating physical degradation. The formation of hydroxyl groups and carbonyl bonds, by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), suggests chemical degradation of OXO-PE. Plastisphere bacterial communities on OXO-PE and PE were different than on PET. Proteobacteria, Bacteriodetes and Planctomycetes were detected on all plastics, however, sequences of Alteromonas and Zoogloea were OXO-PE-specific suggesting a possible involvement of these bacterial genera in OXO-PE degradation. We conclude that OXO-PE shows increased signs of degradation with time owing to the combination of abiotic and biotic processes, and its degradation is higher in the benthic than in the planktonic zone. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Due to disparities of facilities, financial resources and human resources between countries, protocols of sampling, analysis and observations used in developed countries cannot be fully adapted in developing ones, and required specific adaptations. In Viet Nam, an adapted methodology was developed and commonly adopted by local researchers to implement a microplastic monitoring in sediments and surface waters of 21 environments (rivers, lakes, bays, beaches) of eight cities or provinces. Microplastic concentrations in surface waters varied from 0.35 to 2522 items m-3, with the lowest concentrations recorded in the bays and the highest in the rivers. Fibers dominated over fragments in most environments (from 47% to 97%). The microplastic concentrations were related to the anthropogenic pressure on the environment, pointing out the necessity in a near future to identify the local sources of microplastics. ?? 2020 The Author(s)",

MP loads in three Malaysian commercial brands of fish meal were investigated. Chemical composition of extracted MP-like particles was confirmed using micro-Raman spectroscopy. Inorganic composition of MPs and pigment particles were assessed through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Out of 336 extracted particles, 64.3% were plastic polymers, 25% pigment particles, 4.2% non-plastic items, and 6.5% were unidentified. Fragments were the dominant form of MPs (78.2%) followed by filaments (13.4%) and films (8.4%). This study demonstrates that cultured organisms could be exposed to high levels of MPs via MP contaminated fish/shellfish used in fish meal production. Fish meal replacement with other sources of protein including meat meals and plant-based meals may mitigate MP exposure to cultured or farmed organisms. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

The marine plastic debris (MPD) has thus become one of the emerging global environmental and public health problems drawing enormous international attention recently. This article observes that international agreements do not provide sufficient and proper governance mechanisms to address plastic marine debris problems specifically. In preventing the MPD from land-based sources, a well-designed waste management legal and institutional framework with effective implementation shall be established. In this regard, Part I first explores the main features, challenges, and effectiveness of existing international legal norms aims at marine pollution prevention. In Part II, the effectiveness of the plastic waste management legal and policy framework adopted at the international level will be evaluated and critically discussed. Part III explores the critical role of national waste management by reducing the marine litter of plastic waste. A case study for Taiwan's efforts in recovering and recycling plastic waste by establishing a comprehensive waste management framework and effective plastic reduction measures implemented in Taiwan. It is worth to explore Taiwan's waste management law and policy framework and its implementation experience partially because Taiwan's experience could provide some lessons for emerging industrial countries to reduce and to dispose of plastic waste effectively. This article finds that the key to address MPD relies on effective plastic waste management globally. Part IV provides some findings and suggestions for future legal and policy development in the context of international and domestic law and policy framework. It is, however, that the ideal regulatory governance scheme to effectively addressing the issue of MPD shall adopt multiple level governance and cooperative actions involving all stakeholders. ?? 2020",

Its presence was determined on Sardinella lemuru, a commercial pelagic fish that are harvested generally in the Northern Mindanao, consumed locally, and exported worldwide as bottled or canned sardine products. The stomach contents of 600 sardines were examined visually under a microscope, stained with Rose Bengal, and tested with hot needle technique to identify ingested microplastics. These anthropogenic particles were measured and physically classified into fibers, fragments, and films. Results of this study showed that 85% of S. lemuru were already contaminated with 3.74 ?? 3.92 # of microplastics even before being processed into various sardine products.

NLBNAL6K,10.1002/aqc.3469,A country's response to tackling plastic pollution in aquatic ecosystems: The Chilean way,"Marine plastic pollution is worse than expected, and we are starting to realize its full extent and severity. Solving the plastic pollution problem is not easy, as it requires the action and commitment of all sectors of our society. With a coastline extending over 4,000 km (from 18??S to 56??S), Chile is a maritime country, and since plastics are potentially harmful for marine and coastal ecosystems, food security, and public health, plastic pollution is a real threat. Chile is the sixth-largest exporter of seafood (fish, invertebrates, and algae) in the world, but the extent of plastic contamination of marine organisms, its potential effects on commercial species and aquaculture, and its subsequent effects on human health are mostly unknown. Chile has recently introduced some legislation to prevent plastics from reaching the environment and the coastal ocean. Governmental and non-governmental organizations have joined an informal alliance to take action against plastic pollution, both at a national and regional level, but stronger involvement of producers and commerce is required for effective measures. Chilean scientists working on plastic pollution have created the Scientific Plastic Pollution Alliance of Chile network, aiming to promote collaborative and coordinated research focused on this pollutant. The wide geographical extent of Chile, with researchers working in diverse ecosystems, provides a unique opportunity to better understand the consequences of one of the most recent and severe threats to biodiversity. Rather than solely presenting the plastic pollution problem from the scientific perspective, this paper includes views from different sectors of society. Mitigating plastic pollution is exceptionally complex, with this study highlighting the importance of local engagement, media, solving social inequities, new legislation, and law enforcement in order to advance on decreasing plastic pollution from a country-wide perspective. ?? 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Among potential responses to the issue of marine pollution, the group briefly considered?€?but eventually dismissed?€?the possibility of creating a liability or compensation regime. This essay evaluates the prospects for such a regime. As the essay will show, compensation faces significant conceptual problems, not the least of which is the absence of an obvious recipient. However, some form of liability could be imposed on corporations that produce plastic, or on states that fail to regulate them. Such a liability regime, even without financial compensation, could foster the prevention of further marine plastic pollution. ?? Sandrine Maljean-Dubois and Beno??t Mayer 2020.

They have been branded sometimes as evil, which has to be replaced, in some cases at any cost. However, an equitable analysis and assessment are needed comparing all pros and cons based on environmental footprints quantification with a complete life cycle assessment. These should include assessment of possible health risks, consumed energy, released emissions and effluents, as well as consumption of raw materials, water and dealing with the wastewater. The assessment of recyclability, reprocessing and environmental burden of disposal phases are also needed. This presented work tends to contribute to the discussion of what recommendations should be developed to the industry and business to minimize the environmental impacts. A novel Plastic Waste Footprint is proposed to understand the net potential impacts of plastic and to facilitate the decision making for plastic replacement. This study highlighted that plastic could be a friend if the Circular Economy (CE) is appropriately followed. Reduction (refrain, redesign/reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose), recycle and recovery (no leaking into the ocean or other streams) play the decisive roles to minimize and recover the embodied energy, promoting sustainable plastic values chain. Policy to regulate/encourage manufacturers toward sustainable practice (taxation, end of life collection, an incentive of using secondary raw materials) and education (refrain, reuse, separation and recycle) on the potential users are important from not evolving the plastic from friend with high functionality to foe. ?? 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

This study investigated the presence of MPs in an oyster (Saccostrea cuccullata) and three species of brachyuran crabs (Tubuca dussumieri, Cranuca inversa and Gelasimus vocans) along the Kenyan coast. Sampling was carried out at eight stations distributed between three sites: Tudor, Port Reitz and Mida creeks, in January and February 2018, during low spring tide. The sample comprised 206 crabs and 70 oysters. Samples were digested using 10% KOH at 60 ??C for 24 hours and then passed through 38-??m sieves. Sieved products (&lt;38 ??m) were filtered through Whatman filter membranes (0.8 ??m) and viewed under a dissecting microscope for MPs. The study identified mainly MP fibres, which were of different colours: red, yellow, black, pink, orange, purple, green, blue and colourless. Colourless fibres were the most prevalent, comprising at least 60% of the total MPs. Mean lengths of MPs fibres of different colours were between 0.1 and 4.2 mm. The mean concentration of MPs (MPs g???1 wet tissue) was 0.65 (SE 0.13) in crabs and 3.36 (SE 0.53) in oysters, and the difference between the two taxa was significant (independent two-sample t-test: t = 5.61, df = 14, p = 0.01).

Results were estimated using some relevant impact categories of the ReCiPe 2016 MidPoint (H) method, then a marine litter indicator (MLI) has been proposed in order to evaluate the polluting potential of milk bottles dispersed into the Mediterranean Sea. Results and discussion: LCA results show that R-PET bottle gives the lowest contribution to global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, terrestrial acidification, fossil resource scarcity, water consumption and human carcinogenic toxicity, followed by PET bottle, returnable glass bottle, and finally non-returnable glass bottle. Glass is the worst packaging option because of high energy demand in the bottle production and its weight and in the transport phase. Some improvements can be obtained with returnable glass, but even if we consider that a bottle could be reused eight times, results are not comparable to the PET or R-PET bottles used only once. However, according to the MLI, returnable glass bottles become the first option, because a lot of plastic bottles could potentially be dispersed into the sea. Conclusions: The substitution of plastic with glass does not help to reduce the GWP and others LCI categories, while could contribute to reduce the marine litter: overall it is important to dispose correctly packaging materials, investing in recycling and reusing. In particular, great improvements can be obtained using bottles made with recycled materials, as R-PET. In conclusion, it is necessary to disadvantage waste dispersion, giving incentives to returnable packaging and raising people awareness of environmental problems. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

Our study provides an interesting take on the issue of marine waste by examining how Indonesian indigenous communities can deal with plastic marine pollution. While there is an obvious need for mitigating plastic use, for effective legislative policies regulating plastic waste management, and to do more to develop sustainable waste management practices; there are also opportunities for indigenous communities to take an innovative approach by using plastic waste in a manner that drives economic development from both non?€?market and neoliberal theoretical ideologies. As part of this assessment, alongside Indonesian examples we include examples of plastic re?€?use by indigenous communities of the Philippines and Australia. Moreover, our study highlights some of the areas in which this is being done in the fields of art and infrastructure development. ?? 2020.",

The aim of this review is to discuss and highlight the recent advances in FTIR (spectroscopy and chemical imaging) techniques that are used to characterize various polymer types of MPs and to trace their fate and transport in different environmental matrices. More than 400 research papers dealing with FTIR techniques in MP pollution research, which are published between January 2010 and December 2019, have been identified from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The MPs present in sediment, water (marine and freshwater), biota, air/dust, waste water treatment plants and salt are further classified according to (1) characterization and identification, (2) weathering and aging, (3) ecotoxicology, and (4) analytical methods. The results revealed that the ATR-FTIR technique is mostly used to identify and characterize the MPs found in water and sediment. The ??FTIR (FTIR imaging) is extensively used to study the ingestion of MPs in biota (both marine and freshwater). In this article, we have summarized the current knowledge of application of FTIR spectroscopy to MP research and provided insights to future challenges for understanding the risk of MPs. ?? 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

The present study is the first assessment of the floating plastic debris in Jakarta Bay based on an at-sea survey. The study aimed to overview the accumulation of plastic debris in different zones (west, middle, and east) of the bay as the impact of wet and dry seasons. The results showed that plastic debris was found in most sampling stations with a maximum concentration of 10,300 and 7,400 items/km2 in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Based on the plastic types, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) were the main accumulated plastic debris in Jakarta Bay with a predominant macro size between 2.5 and 20 cm. According to the plastic applications, packaging and consumer products were the majority of plastic debris at concentrations of 257-1,280 items/km2 and 936-983 items/km2 in the dry and wet season respectively. The spatial distribution of plastic litter in the observed surface water was correlated to temporal monsoon seasons rather than to the distribution of pollution source from rivers around the Jakarta Metropolitan Area. Moreover, the higher plastic concentration was found in the rainy west monsoon compared to that of the dry east monsoon. ?? 2020, Squalen BMFPB. Accreditation Number: 148/M/KPT/2020.",

While a large number of studies on MPs in marine environments have been performed, few studies are available in freshwater environments. Therefore, the distribution of MPs in surface water and sediment from the Chao Phraya River at Tha Prachan, a high population density area of Bangkok, was investigated. Water samples were collected by a manta trawl with a net mesh size of 300 ??m. Sediment samples were collected by a Van Veen grab sampler. The total number and concentration of MPs in the water samples were found to be 104 particles/m3 and 805.20 mg/m3, respectively. The dominant MPs were fragments, 0.5 to 1.0 mm in size, for the water samples. In the sediment, MPs were detected only in a size range of 0.053 to 0.5 mm with a total number and concentration of 2,290 particles/kg and 650 mg/kg, respectively. The presence of different types of MPs was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with a dominant abundance of polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene. In brief, this study suggests that high levels of MPs occur not only in the water but also in the sediment of the Chao Phraya River at Tha Prachan area. ?? 2020 Published by ITB Institute for Research and Community Services.",

Nevertheless, the interaction of microplastics with freshwater biota is still a poorly explored field. In order to achieve information concerning the uptake, distribution and effect of microplastics in planarians, Dugesia japonica specimens have been fed with mixtures of food and differently shaped and sized plastic particles. Feeding activity and food intake were non-altered by the presence of high concentrations of different types of plastic particles. However, the persistence of microplastic within the planarian body was a function of size/shape, being small spheres (<10 ??m in diameter) and short fibers (14 ??m large and 5/6 ??m length) more persisting than larger spheres and longer fibers which were eliminated almost entirely by ejection in a few hours. Transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that at least part of microplastics was phagocytized by the enterocytes. Chronic exposure to small plastic did not alter the regenerative ability but caused a significant reduction of the gut epithelium thickness and lipid content of enterocytes, together with the induction of apoptotic cell death, modulation of Djgata 4/5/6 expression and reduced growth rate. The ability of microplastic to perturb planarian homeostasis is concerning being them extremely resilient against mechanical and chemical insults and suggests possible harmful effects upon other more susceptible species in freshwater ecosystems. ?? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

HAMSOM was initialized with monthly climatological temperature and salinity data from WOA13 and driven by hourly meteorological data obtained from the NCEP above the sea surface and tides at the open boundary. The ice model used here is a modified Hibler-type dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model based upon viscous-plastic rheology. The ice extent, concentration, area, thickness, length of ice season as well as the distance between the top of Liaodong Bay (North China) and the outer ice edge line were simulated and compared with the observed data. Three types of modeling experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of wind, tide, and both wind and tide on Bohai Sea ice. The results show that wind, as both a dynamic and a thermodynamic factor, has a significant impact on the ice thickness, ice area, and ice-freezing and ice breakup dates as well as the ice velocity, while tides are a dynamic factor that influences only the ice velocity. During the severe ice period, the wind speed intensity increased by 25%, the average ice thickness thickened by approximately 4.0 cm in Liaodong Bay, approximately 2.1 cm in Bohai Bay and approximately 2.5 cm in Laizhou Bay, and the total ice coverage area and total ice actual area increased by about 2??104 km2 and 1.4??104 km2, respectively. While the tidal amplitude intensity increased by 25%, the average ice velocity increased by approximately 0.1 m/s. ?? 2020, Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

To evaluate their role as vectors of chemical contaminants in marine environment, plastic debris (n = 19) collected from coastal beaches along with new plastics (n = 25; same or same brand) bought from local markets were screened by gas chromatography?€?mass spectrometry in full scan mode. Detected peaks were identified using NIST library in different polymers (polypropylene (PP) > polyethylene (PE) > PP + PE > polyethyl terephthalate > poly(acylene:styrene) with different use (food, fishery, and general use). A database on the presence of 231 different chemicals were grouped into hydrocarbons, ultra-violet (UV)-stabilizers, antioxidants, plasticizers, lubricants, intermediates, compounds for dyes and inks, flame retardants, etc. The UV326, UV327, UV328, UV320, UvinualMC80, irganox 1076, DEHP, antioxidant no 33, di-n-octylisophthalate, diisooctyl phthalate, hexanoic acid 2-ethyl-hexadecyl ester, and hydrocarbons were most frequently detected. Finding of toxic phthalates and UV stabilizers in those products having moisture contact (like bottles with short use) raised concern to humans and indicated their irregular use. The comparison between new and debris plastics clearly indicated the leaching and absorption of chemicals and supports our assumption of plastic as media for transferring these additives in marine environment. ?? 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York",

The novel composite system has the potential to be used in marine engineering. The aims of this paper focus on evaluating the seismic performance of SFUHPC tube columns for being designed in costal and marine engineering. A series of low-cycle reversed lateral loading tests were conducted on five relatively large-scale specimens. FRP hoop volumetric ratio, compressive strength of filling SWSSC, and the types of FRP bar were selected as test parameters in this investigation. The failure modes, hysteretic responses and effects of main parameters were studied and discussed. SFUHPC tube columns exhibited flexural failure mode without visible spalling of the UHPC cover. It is noteworthy that the limit plastic drift ratios of all SFUHPC tube columns exceed the specified limits (0.02) in accordance to the rare earthquake requirement in seismic design code. The current study reveals that the proposed composite columns have acceptable ductility and relatively reliable lateral resistant performance for being used in the marine engineering. From the point of view of seismic performance, filling high strength SWSSC in UHPC tube is acceptable for the proposed composite system. ?? The Author(s) 2020.",
YKRPWCL3,10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109749,Are FADs a significant source of marine litter? Assessment of released debris and mitigation strategy in the Mediterranean sea,"A poorly known form of marine litter known as Abandoned, Lost or otherwise Discarded Fishing (ALDFG) derives from fishing activities using FADs (Fish Aggregating Devices). In the Mediterranean Sea, this activity is widespread in southern Italy, Tunisia, Malta and Majorca (Spain). The way of constructing FADs, from a functional point of view, is very similar throughout the Mediterranean and consists mainly of the use of different materials for the floats and for the cables and blocks for anchoring. Every year, for at least 30 years, about 60,000 FADs have been placed at sea and in most cases are not recovered. In this study, through analysis of the scientific and grey literature, a historical reconstruction of the use of FADs in the Mediterranean Sea was made, including their spatial distribution, the number of objects and the materials used to build the devices. It has been estimated that approximately 1.6 million FADs were abandoned in the Mediterranean Sea between 1961 and 2017. The largest fishing areas are off Malta (34,465 km2) and Tunisia (23,033 km2). The greatest numbers of abandoned plastic sheets (452,742) and concrete blocks (905,483) were estimated to be around Tunisia, while the greatest amount, in terms of length, of polyethylene cable (399,423 km) was estimated to be around Sicily. About 30% of FADs used all over the world are used in the Mediterranean and are only of the anchored type (corresponding to about 90% of those anchored used worldwide). The legislation on the use of Mediterranean FADs is still poor and does not address environmental issues. An analysis of the possible environmental impacts of the FAD litter was made. Overall, reducing the number of FADs and introducing new types of FADs equipped with specific technological systems appear to be the most suitable strategies to mitigate the impact of FADs on the environment and resources, as well as measures and incentives to involve fishermen in their better management. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Yet, a third of plastic waste ends up as terrestrial or marine pollution. As a strategy to lower the carbon footprint of plastics, this study aimed to test the hypothesis that using plastics in long-term applications would bring an environmental advantage due to the reduction of plastic pollution, the achievement of negative CO2 emissions (NETs) by bio-based plastics, and demand reduction for emission-intensive construction materials, such as iron, aluminium, wood, and cement. Cradle-to-grave life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and expanded polystyrene (EPS) were performed for four ethylene production routes. For the final disposal, this study assessed incineration; incineration with energy recovery; recycling; and the orientation of plastics for replacing emission-intensive material construction (long-term applications). Findings show that using plastics as long-lifetime materials could lead to NETs, particularly in the cases of bio-based HDPE, bio-based PET, and bio-based EPS. Hence, an opportunity arises, by producing plastics for long-term applications, to reduce both the carbon footprint and the plastic waste generation that may enter the marine environment. ?? 2020 Society of Industrial Chemistry and John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. ?? 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",

Only recently the emission of microplastics is starting to be considered as a threat to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and currently, little information on this topic is available. The present study focuses on the development of a methodology based on the implementation of the hydrodynamic circulation model ELCOM (Estuary and Lake Computer Model) for the estimation of microplastics distribution in Kavala Gulf coastline. The approach aims to include the effects of the high seasonal touristic activity and consequent large fluctuations in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharge rates. Parameters such as microplastic concentration, effluent flow rate and temperature, meteorological forcing and scalars at the boundaries were applied and the simulation was designed to cover the entire 2006 in order to include an approximation of the seasonal 3D dispersion patterns. The microplastic concentration was estimated based on the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration measurements applying the approach of [1]. The physical and chemical parameters of the particles were assumed to conform with the assumptions of [2]. The results showed a strong correlation between the microplastics dispersion patterns, the wind climate and the seasonal increase in population during the summer. Microplastic concentrations reached up to 0.185 ??g/l in the WWTPs adjacent coastline in correspondence to the beaches with the highest touristic activity. The periodical formation of anticyclonic flows resulted in a net transport towards the center of the gulf and an increase in microplastic concentration in the bottom layer. On the other hand, the simulation showed that considerable quantities of microplastics tend to be transported outside the study area and far from the coastline in deeper waters. ?? 2020 All Rights Reserved",

A sample of four selected beaches were subjected to detailed photography followed by beach macro-litter (??? 2.5 cm) in-situ sampling surveys over a period of one year, to calibrate and validate the proposed method. Regression analysis between photographic and in-situ data showed a significant correlation, hence providing a highly accurate regression model to assess the real number of beach litter stranded on the rest of the investigated beaches, exhibiting clear correlations to the hydrodynamic status of the area and, provide an indication of the main litter sources.

EN5CD5M9,10.1177/1369433220965272,Effects of mixing water salinity on the properties of concrete,"The use of seawater and sea-sand in producing concrete has attracted increasing research attention in recent years to address the shortage of river sand and in certain applications the shortage of freshwater. In particular, reinforced concrete structures made of seawater sea-sand concrete (SSC) and corrosion-resistant fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) are particularly attractive for the development of coastal and marine infrastructure (e.g. on remote islands) as durable structures can be created using locally available materials. Existing studies on SSC or seawater concrete have been largely limited to the use of mixing water with a salinity level close to the world-average ocean salinity. Against this background, the present paper reports the first ever systematic study on the effect of salinity of mixing water on the properties of concrete. The present study covered a wide range of salinity levels from 16.5 g/L to 82.5 g/L, and examined a wide range of short-term concrete properties including the heat of hydration, shrinkage, compressive strength and modulus of elasticity. The test results show that the salinity of mixing water has a considerable effect on the rate of hydration heat and shrinkage at early ages, as well as the cumulative release of hydration heat. It is also shown that the water salinity has a slight negative effect on the compressive strength and modulus of elasticity of concrete at ages older than 14 days. ?? The Author(s) 2020.",

Plastics have redefined society's material culture and the artefacts that will be left behind. Plastic pollution in the ocean and in coastal environments is a growing concern which requires immediate attention. Single-use plastic is polluting coastal environments the world over, and this study focused on the issue within the context of Durban, South Africa. Advocating for behavioral changes from society remains a daunting task that requires an understanding of consumer perceptions towards single-use of plastics. This research paper aimed to gain an understanding of the social perceptions that beachgoers hold towards single-use plastic consumption in the coastal areas of Durban, South Africa. The sustainability science theoretical framework underpinned the research and the study used a mixed-methods approach to achieve the objectives. Questionnaires were used to accurately capture and reflect the perceptions towards single-use plastic consumption by the Durban beachgoers. The results from the study indicated that Durban beachgoers have a generally more negative perception towards single-use plastic; a high level of awareness towards their impacts on the environment; and a strong willingness to reduce their consumption of single-use plastic. Additionally, the results revealed a strong support towards potentially implementing a Container Deposit System (CDS) and a plastic bag ban in Durban to reduce the number of plastic bottles and bags polluting the coastal environment. Based on the findings, recommendations emphasized the need to incentivize reusable shopping bags; promote increased awareness and advocacy pertaining to the environmental concerns of single-use plastic; consider the implementation of a CDS; and further explore the potential of a plastic bag ban in Durban. This research can contribute towards developing adequate, appropriate strategies to address the issues of single-use plastic pollution. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

These involved: (1) including the Coriolis force, which was found to explain behavior of submerged floats near mesoscale eddies; (2) accounting for the combined effects of ocean current and wind drag on inertial particles floating at the air?€?sea interface, which helped understand the formation of great garbage patches and the role of anticyclonic eddies as plastic debris traps; and (3) incorporating elastic forces, which are needed to simulate the drift of pelagic Sargassum.

7M7NV5MB,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.106757,Deformation and fabric of soft marine clay at various cyclic load stages,"Soft marine clay is susceptible to deformation under cyclic loading, controlled by microstructure variations. To investigate the microscopic characteristics of soft clay with the progression of deformation under cyclic loading, a detailed study has been conducted using consolidated undrained cyclic triaxial tests, as well as mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The relationships between the micro parameters and accumulated plastic strain of soft marine clay are discussed. Cyclic triaxial test results show that low cyclic stress ratio (CSR) induces stable deformation, while for greater CSR the deformation of soft marine clay presents a closely linear or exponential increase, which leads to the destructuration of the soil structure. The microanalysis shows that with vibration cycles under 0.15 CSR, the content of pore obtained by SEM decreases from 37% to 25%, and large aggregates are visibly crushed into smaller ones, leading to a 24% increase in the pore numbers, which shows the slow increase of the deformation. When the CSR is greater than 0.25, large diameter pores generate resulting in divergent development of accumulated plastic strain. An empirical model of accumulated plastic strain involving micro parameter is proposed for assessing the deformation of soft marine clay. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

MUTZQKYT,10.1071/WR20080,Flooding-induced mortality of loggerhead sea turtle eggs,"Context: Marine turtle eggs incubate in dynamic beaches, where they are vulnerable to both saltwater and freshwater flooding. Understanding the capacity for marine turtle eggs to tolerate flooding will aid management efforts to predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise and increases in coastal flooding. Aims: Evaluate the interactive effects of flooding duration and incubation stage on the hatching success of loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) eggs. Methods: Groups of 20 eggs from multiple clutches were incubated in plastic containers in a beach hatchery. Eggs at six stages of incubation (0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 weeks post-oviposition) were excavated from the hatchery and exposed to saltwater or freshwater flooding for seven durations of time (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 24 or 48 h). Containers of eggs were either submerged in a bucket of water or left outside of the bucket (control; no flooding) for their designated duration, allowed to drain, then reburied in the hatchery. Following hatchling emergence, the hatching success of each group of eggs was evaluated. Key results: Freshly laid eggs and eggs on the verge of hatching exposed to any flooding and all eggs exposed to extended periods of flooding (24 and 48 h) suffered complete mortality. Eggs at 20-80% development exposed to short periods of flooding (1-6 h) maintained high hatching success that was statistically equivalent to control eggs, while eggs at <20% and >80% development exhibited significant decreases in hatching success. Conclusions: Marine turtle eggs in the middle of incubation can tolerate saltwater and freshwater flooding for up to 6 h. Outside of this period or when flooding is longer, disruption of gas concentrations and osmotic gradients in the egg chamber can lead to embryonic mortality. These findings have reinforced concerns regarding the capacity for marine turtle populations to continue to function as rising sea levels and increases in coastal flooding alter the hydrology of nesting beaches. Implications: As current and predicted climate change threatens the suitability of the incubation environment used by marine turtles, corrective actions to maximise hatching success need to be taken before the eggs are flooded. ?? 2020 CSIRO.",

One such interaction, that is poorly investigated, is the incorporation of marine debris into the nests of seabirds, which at times results in hatchling entanglement. The objective of this study is to investigate the qualitative and quantitative aspects of marine debris used in the construction of the nests of sooty gulls Larus (Adelarus) hemprichii (Bruch, 1853) from Sir Bu Na'ir Island, United Arab Emirates. The numeric and gravimetric proportions of debris were documented following classification of type, color and presumed source. The results show that 11.2% of the 258 active nests examined contained debris. On average, nests included 2.0 ?? 0.4 items of 6.1 ?? 1.9 g mass. Non-plastic rubbish, particularly metals and glass, were the predominant debris utilized. The results reflect that sooty gulls frequently use anthropogenic debris as nesting materials in Sir Bu Na'ir Island. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Previous research has shown that plasticizers such as phthalate esters detected in seabird tissues can be useful non-lethal biochemical markers of plastic ingestion as compared with more standard necropsy techniques. We examined the concentrations of six phthalate esters in the preen oil of Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) in relation to their retained plastics. Contrary to a previous study, we found that the phthalates examined were not analytically detectable in fulmar preen oil. Given that the birds we examined had up to 100 pieces of plastics in their stomachs, and all uropygial glands were completely emptied during the necropsies, it does not appear that measuring phthalates in preen oil of Northern Fulmars is a useful, non-lethal technique to determine if individuals ingest plastics, at least not currently given the available commercial analytical detection limits. ?? 2019",

J29Y3IY2,,Degradability of different packaging polymeric materials in sea water,"The comparison of environmental degradability of different packaging polymeric materials in the Baltic Sea water was the subject of this paper. The experiment was also performed in laboratory at ambient temperature in a liquid medium containing sea water with sodium azide to evaluate the resistance of polymers against hydrolysis. The characteristic parameters of environment were measured during the period of degradation and their influence on degradation of polymers was discussed. The degradation processes of packaging polymers: polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, poly(??-caprolactone), their modification with starch and natural poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) were studied by microscopic observations of polymer surfaces, changes of weight and tensile strength during the incubation under natural and laboratory conditions. The obtained results confirm good resistance of pure polyethylene to sea water and indicate that the modification of polyethylene with starch improves degradability of this blend in natural aqueous biological environment. Degradation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) and poly(??-caprolactone) in natural marine environment occurs very fast. And after 6 weeks incubation the poly(??-caprolactone) samples were completely disintegrated. ?? Green Ships, Eco Shipping,AGA-IAMU 2011.All right reserved.",

Yet the global plastic system is linked to a multitude of problems of a scope that is hard to grasp and address. In short, we are facing a plastic crisis. This article explores the role of art in stimulating critical reflection about plastics and analyses how it contributes to making the plastic crisis increasingly visible. Plastic-related artworks mostly focus on ocean pollution and do not pay due attention to other aspects of the plastic crisis. At the same time, they creatively communicate clear and emotionally charged messages. Art has the potential to play an important role in coming to grips with the plastic crisis if it succeeds in adopting a broader understanding of the problem. Technical summary Since the mid-twentieth century, plastic has become a ubiquitous material. However, its production, consumption and disposal on a massive scale have led to a range of devastating consequences that together form the ?€?plastic crisis?€?. This paper presents a novel mapping of the ways contemporary artistic visual representations narrate and politicize the plastic crisis through their different messages and aesthetics. Drawing on a multifaceted understanding of the plastic crisis and on how art navigates political and aesthetic spheres, an analysis of 35 artworks is conducted. Ocean plastic pollution emerges as a dominant theme, together with disposability; and these are connected to consumption patterns and consumer responsibility. However, less attention is given to plastic?€?s dependence on fossil fuels and possible toxicity. The result is art of striking beauty and emotional resonance, but that downplays the systemic nature of the plastic crisis and the urgent need to hold manufacturers and regulators to account. Social media summary Visual art makes plastic ocean pollution strikingly visible, but renders other facets of the plastic crisis obscure. ?? The Author(s), 2020.",

GTS4JTNJ,10.1080/03067319.2020.1733546,"Metal adsorption by microplastics in aquatic environments under controlled conditions: exposure time, pH and salinity","In recent decades there has been a significant increase in the presence of plastics in the environment, particularly in the marine environment, due to its great applicability in all fields of life. The effects of chronic ingestion of contaminated microplastics are still unknown, but several studies suggest that there is a potential gateway to the trophic network, especially when these plastics support other pollutants harmful to human life and act as a vehicle of entry into the organisms, making them more bioavailable. For this reason, the present work aims to evaluate the adsorption capacity that microplastics have for different metals depending on the physicochemical conditions of the aquatic environments (exposure time, pH, salinity). To do this, two types of microplastics were selected (polypropylene and polyethylene), and a group of two essential metals (Cu, Zn) and two toxic ones (Cd, Pb) were evaluated. Virgin pellets of both, polyethylene and polypropylene, were able to adsorb metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn) in the aquatic environment, although the adsorption was low in most of the cases. Only minor differences were found in the adsorption capacity of the two studied materials. The exposure time showed an important effect regarding the adsorption capabilities of pellets, showing different adsorption rates for different metals. However, all studied metals showed the same behaviour in relation to pH and salinity, increasing the adsorption percentages as pH increase, and decreasing the adsorption percentages when salinity increase for lower salinities. ?? 2020, ?? 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

The last 10 years have seen research directed at understanding the fate and effect of microplastics within the marine environment; however, no studies have yet addressed how concentrations of these particles could affect sedimentary processes such as nutrient cycling. Herein we first determine the concentration and spatial distribution of microplastics within Baynes Sound, a key shellfish-growing area within coastal British Columbia (BC). We also determined sediment grain size and % organic matter (OM) such that we could relate spatial patterns in sediment microplastic concentrations to sedimentary processes that determine zones of accretion and erosion. Using field-determined concentrations of microplastics, we applied laboratory microcosms studies, which manipulated sediment concentrations of microplastics, OM, and bivalves to determine the influence of sediment microplastics on ammonium cycling within intertidal sediments. Concentrations of microplastics determined within the intertidal sediment varied spatially and were similar to those found in other coastal regions of high urban use. Concentrations were independent of grain size and OM suggesting that physical processes other than those that govern natural sediment components determine the fate of microplastics within sediments. Under laboratory conditions, concentrations of ammonium were significantly greater in the overlying water of treatments with microplastics, clams, and OM compared with treatments without microplastics. These preliminary studies suggest that high concentrations of microplastics have the potential to alter key sedimentary processes such as ammonium flux. This could have serious implications, for example, contributing to eutrophication events in regions of the coast that are highly urbanized. ?? 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York",

Baseline data on biodiversity and responses to environmental change are urgently needed. Benthic decapod crustaceans are globally distributed and play an important role in fisheries, yet their roles in food webs are less understood. In this study, we used an integrated approach combining stomach content analysis and stable isotope analyses (??13C and ??15N) to examine the trophic niches of three decapod species in the Pechora Sea including the invasive snow crab Chionoecetes opilio and two species of native decapods, the spider crab Hyas araneus and the hermit crab Pagurus pubescens. Stomach contents of 75 decapods were analysed (C. opilion = 23; H. araneusn = 9; P. pubescensn = 43), and 20 categories of prey items were identified with the most frequently occurring prey items being bivalve molluscs (Ciliatocardium ciliatum, Ennucula tenuis, Macoma calcarea), polychaetes, crustaceans and plant debris. Bayesian ellipse analyses of stable isotope signatures (n = 40) revealed that C. opilio displays an overlapping trophic niche with the two native decapods, providing direct evidence that the invader likely competes for food resources with both H. araneus and P. pubescens. As such, the presence of this invasive species could hold important consequences for trophic interactions, benthic ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. Microplastics were also found to be a likely stressor on this ecosystem, as 28% of all stomachs contained digested microplastics among other items. Long-term studies of benthic ecosystem structure and functioning are now needed to more fully understand the extent to which this new competitor may alter the future biodiversity of the Pechora Sea alongside the additional stressor of digested plastics. ?? 2020, The Author(s).",

D74YQLWN,10.1115/OMAE2020-18657,A three-dimensional fe approach for the fatigue analysis of flexible pipes tensile armors inside end fittings,"During the end fitting (EF) assembly, the tensile armors of flexible pipes are folded and then unfolded to allow the assessment to the inner sheath and the activation of the inner sealing system. This procedure leaves residual stresses and plastic deformations on these armors, which affect their fatigue resistance and, consequently, the overall performance of the pipe. Hence, in this work, a methodology to predict the fatigue resistance of tensile armors inside an EF is proposed. This methodology relies on stresses calculated with a previously presented three-dimensional finite element (FE) approach and is employed to analyze the fatigue response of a 6""production riser in catenary configuration. This fatigue analysis not only addresses the effects from several irregular sea states but also the local stress concentrations associated with the EF assembly and pre-operational tests (e. g., Factory Acceptance Test, FAT). The results obtained indicate that the EF entrance may be a critical point for fatigue failure and, moreover, the lower fatigue resistance is related to a region where higher alternate stresses occur despite the very high mean stresses are observed in other regions along the tensile armors.

The aim of this study is to assess the beach litter composition, distribution, and abundance in some selected beaches of the World Heritage Site of Dungonab Bay and Mukkawar Island National Park (DMNP) located in Sudan, Red Sea coast, and to examine the rate of beach litter flux and the cleanliness of its beaches in order to provide baseline information for beach litter management at DMNP. A total of 6 sites were investigated for beach litter over a 10-month period from January to October 2017 on a quarterly basis. A total of 24 collections of beach litter were performed covering a stretch of 600 m or 7700 m2 of DMNP coastline. In total, 3037 beach litter items were collected during the study time from DMNP with an overall average of 506.2 ?? 409.8 items/100 m (0.4 items/m2). Plastic beach litter was the most abundant (1738 items), constituting 57.23% with an average density of 289.7 ?? 242.2 items/100 m (0.23 items/m2). The beaches of DMNP were clean (CCI = 4.6) at the time of the study. The rate of flux of the beach litter decreased steadily from 21.9 to 16.43 items/100 m/day with an overall average of 18.82 ?? 2.8 items/100 m/day. The gradual decrease in the net accumulation of beach litter over the period of the study suggests that the beach litter at DMNP was likely of a local land-based origin and the beaches of DMNP are not a potential sink of marine litter. The determination of the rate of flux of beach litter is a reasonable indicator of the dynamics of beach litter in DMNP. Accordingly, application of preventive measures accompanied with awareness activities and investment in plastic collection and recycling would further enhance and preserve the present status of beach cleanliness and encourage tourism activities. ?? 2020 Eldirdery Abeadallah Abdelrahman Ibrahim et al.",

Gradual accumulation of artificial polymer products and their fragments in the natural environment has reached a level at which it is already impossible to ignore the affect of these materials on living organisms. First and foremost, microorganism colonies inhabiting different biotopes, both aquatic and terrestrial, have been affected. These species are at the front-end of interaction with plastic, including those present in marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, in order to understand these processes, it is necessary to take into account several aspects of such interactions: the impact of different types of plastic on microbial community through the release of their decomposed products into the environment, the forms of plastic usage by microorganisms themselves, including mechanisms for surface colonization, as well as possible biodegradation processes of polymers due to the actions of microorganisms. At the same time, types of plastic may differ not only in mechanical strength, but also in their resistance to biodegradation caused by microorganisms. Experiments with surface colonization of types of plastic, which are different in composition and mechanical strength, provide a wide range of results that are not just relevant for understanding modern natural processes involving plastic: these results are also important for application in certain areas of technology development (for example, when creating composite materials). In particular, researches into the forms and mechanisms of sustainable colonization of particularly strong polymers by diatoms from natural communities are of great interest. Due to the fouling of surface of particularly strong synthetic polymers by diatoms, it is possible to form a single diatom-polymeric composite with general properties being already substantially different from those of the polymer itself. For example, when a polymer is fouled with diatoms that are firmly held on its surface due to physiological mechanisms that ensure their reliable fixation, total surface area of the composite increases by 2?€?3 orders of magnitude compared with this of bare polymer. Such composites and their properties are formed due to mechanisms of substrate colonization used by diatoms from natural marine cenoses ?€? during the transfer of these mechanisms to a new material being prospective for diatom settlement. The practical applications of these composites lie in the sphere of heat and sound insulation, as well as in the field of creating prosthetic tissues for bone operations. In our experiments, we tracked the sequence of development of a stable composite when diatoms colonized the surface of samples of a particularly strong synthetic polymer being resistant to corrosion. In this case, the sample population process took place on the basis of colonies formed in accumulative cultures from the natural marine environment. Samples of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) with a smooth and porous surface structure (with an open cell, bulk porosity up to 80 %) were colonized by diatoms Karayevia amoena (Hust.) Bukht., 2006, Halamphora coffeaeformis (C. Agardh) Levkov, 2009, and Halamphora cymbifera (W. Greg.) Levkov, 2009. These laboratory experiments lasted for three weeks. Accumulative microphyte cultures, on the basis of which the experiments were conducted, were obtained from the Baltic Sea (Baltiysk area, Russia) and the Arabian Sea (Mumbai area, India). The types and stages of development of colonial settlements on various elements of the frontal surface microrelief and in the underlying caverns were studied using a scanning electron microscope on samples subjected to stepwise thermal drying. Individual cells of K. amoena, H. coffeaeformis, and H. cymbifera, their chain-like aggregates, and outstretched colonial settlements occupied varying in degree non-homogeneous microrelief surface elements, forming structures with a thickness of 1?€?2 layers with an average settlement height of 1?€?1.3 single specimen height. K. amoena cells were tightly fixed to the polymer substrate using the pore apparatus of the flap of the frustule. Observations using scanning electron microscope revealed shell imprints on the substrate, which were signs of a polymer substrate introduction into hypotheca are-oles. The spread mechanisms of diatoms of three mentioned species on various elements of UHMWPE surface were explored, as well as the formation of the characteristic elements of colonial settlements, including for K. amoena ?€? consecutively in the form of ?€?pots?€? and spheres, by means of interaction with polymer surface and its extension with the increase in the number of tightly attached cells in the colonial settlement. ??

This leads not only to the reduction of landfills and increase in environmental problems but also to pollution of marine and oceans that affect the lives of many living things. Therefore, recycling of waste polyethylene terephthalate bottles with recycling technologies has great environmental importance. In this study, recycled polyester yarns obtained by recycling waste polyethylene terephthalate bottles and standard polyester yarns were used in staple forms, as well as binder and pile yarns of the chenille yarn structure. In this context, 16 different chenille yarns were produced and the production parameters such as rotor speed, spindle speed, and pile density are kept constant by selecting the appropriate values. Then, these chenille yarns were used as weft to produce upholstery fabrics. Tensile strength and elongation tests were applied to the upholstery fabrics, and the results were evaluated statistically. As a result of the tensile strength tests and statistical analyses, it is concluded that the weft breaking strength of all types of woven fabrics, which have 100% recycled polyester in the structures of chenille yarns as weft, is slightly decreased compared to other types, but this decrease is not statistically significant. The use of recycled polyester yarns in the structures of chenille yarns, which are widely used in the upholstery sector, will be beneficial in producing more sustainable and eco-friendly fabrics. ??

Bottom sediments were identified as one of the major sinks of MPs, while river-lake systems - as the main transport routs of MPs into the coastal seas and the World Ocean. Thus, the MPs determination in freshwater sediments is an important task for identifying sedimentation processes and contamination sources. Density separation is commonly used to extract anthropogenic particles from bottom sediments. The proposed method is dedicated to determining the abundance of MPs in freshwater organic-rich sediments.

Champlain Sea clay has a high salinity level in its pore fluid. A leaching apparatus was developed to leach a series of 15-cm diameter undisturbed Champlain Sea clay samples to different salinity levels. A series of geotechnical tests were conducted on leached samples. The salinity levels investigated in this study ranged from an initial salinity value of 9.50 g/l to as low as 0.35 g/l. Based on test results, it was found that leaching causes profound and significant property changes in Champlain Sea clay. It results in a greater reduction for the liquid limit than that of the plastic limit. In the study, the plasticity index was reduced by 14% to 31% due to leaching, while the liquidity index reduced by 4% to 26%. Leaching also causes an increase in the sensitivity of the clay since leaching reduces more the remolded shear strength of the clay than that of undisturbed shear strength. Within the studied salinity levels, leaching increased the compressibility of Champlain Sea clay by 20% and reduced the preconsolidation pressure of the clay sample by one-third. At the same time, leaching reduced the shear strength by more than 40% and undrained shear modulus of Champlain Sea clay by about 50%. ?? 2020, ?? 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

It is argued that the current Indonesian laws and regulations for dealing with oil pollution and marine debris are inadequate tools to effectively combat the environmental threats from oil pollution and MPP. This article demonstrates the gaps remaining in implementing the relevant legal framework, namely through the rules of a strict liability and MPP, to address marine pollution in Indonesian waters. ??

PRQBVVRG,10.1177/1369433219870580,The durability of seawater sea-sand concrete beams reinforced with metal bars or non-metal bars in the ocean environment,"In this article, the flexural durability of three types of seawater sea-sand concrete beams that were fully reinforced with steel bars, 304 stainless steel bars, or fiber-reinforced polymer bars were comparatively tested. Beam specimens were conditioned in a 40??C seawater wet?€?dry cycling environment and a 50??C seawater immersion environment for up to 9 months with an interval of 3 months. The test results showed that in the absence of an additional current (even if the temperature is elevated), the flexural properties of the seawater sea-sand concrete beams reinforced with steel bars and stainless steel bars after 9 months of conditioning did not show any degradation trends. However, for the carbon fiber?€?reinforced polymer bar?€?reinforced beams (top bars and stirrups are both basalt fiber?€?reinforced polymer bars) conditioned in the high-temperature and high-humidity environment considered, the failure modes changed from concrete crushing in the pure bending section to concrete crushing at loading points in the shear span with a maximum reduction of 30% in the ultimate load-carrying capacity. In addition, the crack distribution of conditioned carbon fiber?€?reinforced polymer bar?€?reinforced beams became sparse, and the crack width increased significantly, with a maximum of 2.2 times. In addition, obvious sudden load drops were observed in the tested load?€?displacement curves. ?? The Author(s) 2019.",

This study compared the distribution of microplastics in forest, urban, and agricultural soils, investigating the reasons for differences in abundance associated with land use. Materials and methods: We analyzed distribution and abundance of microplastics in 100 soils, representing different land use types that include forest, urban (traffic and residence), and agriculture the environs of Yeoju City. Sampling plots were located on a systematic grid with 2.5 km ?? 2.5km spacing. Topsoil (0?€?5 cm) was collected with a hand auger and samples were pretreated by drying, density separation using ZnCl2 solution, organic matter digestion, and decompression filtration. Abundance of microplastics was measured by counting using a digital stereo microscope; microplastics were grouped by shapes (fragment, film, fiber, and sphere) and color (black, red, green, blue, yellow, white, and transparent). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis was used to identify polymer type of the microplastics. Results and discussion: Soils of Yeoju contained an average 700 pieces??kg???1 of microplastics, but this greatly varied with land use types. Roadside soils had more microplastics (1108 pieces kg???1), mostly black styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) fragments associated with tire dust. Unexpectedly, the largest amount of microplastics was detected not from urban soils but from an upland soil (3440 pieces kg???1). The mean abundance of microplastics in agricultural soil was 664 pieces kg???1, varying with farming types; the highest abundance was at orchard sites, followed by upland, greenhouse, and then paddy field sites. Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were identified from microplastics sampled at upland, greenhouse, and orchard sites, while SBR-derived microplastics were found more widely in all farmland soils, implicating that mulching film usage and farm machinery. Conclusions: Soil microplastic contamination is significant and widespread in urban and agricultural soils of Yeoju, but differs in form and distribution, according to the locality of traffic and farming. Atmospheric fallout to forest soils is quantified and found to be significantly impacted by microplastics. The use of mulching film as a source of PE and PP presents particular concern in terms of the effects of microplastic contamination on soil quality, health, and functionality in agroecosystems. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

In this study, MPs were determined for the first time in sediments from R??as Baixas and Mi??o river shelf, to show the baseline contamination levels. The R??as is well known for its intense fishing and shellfish harvesting activities. The sampling stations were selected due to their different exposure to anthropogenic activities and/or pressures. Sediment samples were collected using a box corer dredge and analyzed with density separation and ??F-TIR analysis to determine polymer type. The results showed MPs pollution in all stations. The mean concentration was 70.2 ?? 74.2 particles/kg DW. The main MPs shape was fibers (88.8%) followed by fragments (5.80%). Regarding the polymers, the most abundant were PP (43%) and HDPE (29%).

Sixteen PFASs were detected, of which perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant compound, detected in 100% of birds (1.34?€?13.4 ng/g wet wt). Long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, including perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA; &lt;0.04?€?0.79 ng/g wet wt) and perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA; &lt;0.05?€?1.6 ng/g wet wt) were detected in &gt;50% of birds. There was a positive correlation between PFDA and PFTrDA concentrations and wing chord length (Rs = 0.36, p = 0.0204; Rs = 0.44, p = 0.0037, respectively), and between PFDA concentrations and total body mass (Rs = 0.33, p = 0.032), suggesting that these compounds may impact shearwater fledgling morphometrics. Plastic was present in the intestinal tract of 79% of individuals (&lt;7.6 g), although there was no correlation between PFAS concentrations and plastic mass, indicating that ingested plastic is not the likely primary exposure source. The widespread occurrence of PFASs in fledgling marine birds from a relatively pristine location in the Southern Hemisphere suggests that further studies in adult shearwaters and other marine birds are warranted to investigate whether there are any long-term physiological effects on bird species.

Otolith microchemistry has proven to be a powerful tool to address natal origins of anadromous fish. We used archived otolith microchemistry to investigate the population-specific composition of subadult European shads (Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax) in the ocean during the 1980s. The allocation of natal origin was addressed relying on contemporary water and juveniles?€? signatures within a Bayesian model. A great discrimination of natal origin was obtained at the Biscay Gulf scale. However, the discrimination of 1980s natal origin for the southern rivers with similar geology based on 2013 water and juveniles?€? baselines was doubtful. Our results showed that the most abundant southern populations were dominant, suggesting that population-specific composition was related to population relative abundance. The dispersion in the marine environment was plastic; alternatively, shads were found large distances away from their natal rivers, while others remained in the vicinity of their natal river plume. ?? 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

The industry is further blamed for causing ocean plastic pollution and associated negative impacts on the marine environment including fish deaths. Consequently, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation and other key role players have been calling for the tourism industry to embrace and localise the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) so as to address some of the concerns and in the process ensure buisness sustainability. However, since the Declaration of 2017 as the Year of Sustainable Tourism, very few studies have reviewed the role of tourism in the localisation of SDGs. Using primary, archival and secondary data, the paper presents an example of how a private nature reserve in the Cape Floral Kingdom (a World Heritage Site) has localised SDGs. The study shows that the Grootbos Foundation, Grootbos Private Nature Reserve has localised 16 SDGs through various initiatives targeting several aspects of business operations, including commerce, conservation, community, and culture. In addition, the study also highlights some critical challenges that are being faced by tourism companies in the localisation of SDGs which calls for greater scientific engagement and research so as to find innovative solutions. The study recommends the replication of the model by similar tourism businesses located near and in protected areas, to ensure tourism sustainability. ?? 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",

Comparatively smaller attention has been devoted to the plastisphere of plastics buried in marine sediments, and very little is known on that of plastics on coastal sand dunes. Yet, limited information is available on the impact of plastics, especially biodegradable plastics, on microbial organisms in their surroundings. Nevertheless, a large amount of plastics sink on the seabed or is deposited on beach-dune systems. We investigated the succession of plastisphere microbial community on two biodegradable composites based on poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and seagrass fibres (PHBV/PO), buried in seabed and dune sediments over a 27 months period in mesocosm. PHBV is regarded as a valuable alternative to conventional plastics and PHBV/PO has recently been designed for applications in coastal habitat restoration. We also examined the degradation rate and impact of these plastics on the microbial communities of surrounding sediments. Microbial communities of the surface of PHBV and PHBV/PO in seabed and dune sand differ from those of surrounding sediments, displaying a lower richness. Plastics colonization occurs largely from bacteria present in surrounding sediments, although the contribution from the water column bacterial pool could be not negligible for plastics in the seabed. No significant differences were detected between the communities of the two plastics and no significant impact of plastics on microbial community of the surrounding sediments was detected. The exceptional long duration of this study allowed to gain information on the succession of a plastisphere community over a previously unexplored time scale. Succession appears highly dynamic in dune sand even after two years, while the community structure in seabed seems to reach stability after one year. These findings highlight the importance of performing long-term studies when trying to characterize composition and dynamics of plastisphere bacterial communities. ?? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

6NRXH2CV,,Closing the loop - Recycling waste plastic,"Worldwide we produce billions of tonnes of waste per year, including a million tonnes of plastic waste. Currently, there are methods for recycling plastic, but these methods can be expensive and time-consuming, resulting in most of the plastic being thrown into the landfill. Because plastic does not fully degrade, it ends up in the ocean and other waterways, poisoning the water with toxins. The purpose of this research is to provide a solution to reducing plastic waste by creating an alternative method of recycling that utilises new technologies such as additive manufacturing, to create a building material that fits into the concept of the circular economy. The findings of this research explored the recycling of plastic by collecting plastic waste such as PLA (Polylactic Acid) from old 3D printed models and other sources. The plastic was recycled into filament for additive manufacturing (AM) and used to print a building component, establishing a foundational proof of concept for the use of recycled plastic as a potential building material. ?? 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",

The investigation of the derivative and the integral of the sigmoid curve can give more information about where is the maximum of the growth speed, and how durable the maximum speed is. These results could increase our knowledge when investigating a phenomenon (growth history, saturation, future behaviour of the phenomenon). In this paper, the quantity of plastic contamination of the world oceans is investigated. The history curve of the world?€?s plastic production is a sigmoid curve (logistic curve), so every useful information which can be derived from the curve, from its derivative and integral can be applied to the present and to the future of the contamination quantity, because there is a strong connection between the quantity of produced plastics and of the plastic contamination quantity of the seas. The results of the investigation of the sigmoid curve of the plastic contamination will give us information about the history and the future of the contamination process. A better understanding of these characteristics of the phenomena could help to design better the future steps to stop or at least decrease this dangerous contamination form.

BPV8JBL6,10.1115/OMAE2020-18747,Fracture assessment of flaws in undermatching welds,"The criticality of girth weld flaws in subsea pipelines, installed by methods introducing plastic strains such as reel-lay, is usually evaluated through an engineering critical assessment (ECA). Most ECA methodologies require weld overmatch for pipes subjected to plastic deformation. This, however, is not always achievable for corrosion resistant or even carbon steel pipelines. In this case, a material and geometry-specific ECA is often applied. However, this ECA approach necessitates many 3D finiteelement (FE) fracture analyses to be performed. Therefore, the authors propose a simpler screening assessment, which requires undertaking only a limited number of 3D FE fracture analyses. If the significance of a weld undermatch is shown to be negligible then a material and geometry-specific FE-based ECA is deemed unnecessary. Instead, flaw acceptance criteria can be determined under the assumption of weld evenmatch using a material-specific analytical ECA. The work was undertaken to define and validate the screening assessment process. Subsequently, DNV-GL endorsed the proposed approach which has since been successfully applied on several projects allowing optimization of the project cost and schedule. This paper describes the screening assessment methodology and discusses its application range and limitations. The conclusions and recommendations from a validation program are also provided.

Microplastics may enter WWTPs from consumer activities and disposal. An exposure framework was developed using the iSTREEM?? model, which estimates spatially explicit concentrations of substances in riverine systems across the United States and portions of Ontario, Canada. One hundred simulations covering a range of WWTP removal and instream loss rates (proxy for net sedimentation) were incorporated into a Web-based visualization tool for user exploration of relative concentrations across simulations. Surface water concentrations specific to user-supplied tonnage were examined via interactive heat maps and cumulative distributions. Exploring the spatial aspect of iSTREEM results showed that modeling 90% WWTP removal and no instream loss resulted in 8.5% of the mass entering WWTPs discharged to marine estuaries (7.4%) or Great Lakes (1.1%) environments, with the remainder of the mass discharged (1.5%) in inland sinks or exiting the United States via rivers. Modeling an example instream loss of k = 0.1 d?€?1 (i.e., half-life = 7 d), terminal river segments contained 3.3% of influent mass (2.3% marine estuaries, 1.0% Great Lakes).

In the distance image sensor by CMOS on land application, both the emitter unit and the receiver unit are installed in a same board.

In the latter, marine grade aluminum materials are utilized to construct the hull, appendages, and/or specific components. In particular, 5xxx series aluminum materials are relied on by the marine industry for these purposes, where their material properties are advantageous to reducing the overall weight of naval platforms and reducing their operational cost. During its lifetime, a marine vessel will experience a multitude of variable amplitude loading conditions, with occasional overloads and underloads depending on the sea environment encountered. In some cases, these overloads/underloads result affect the catastrophic failure of the structure and associated design lifetime due to changes in the crack growth rate in 5xxx aluminum materials. Existing models, like the Wheeler, Willemborg, and variations of these, have been utilized to predict the crack growth behavior with varying degrees of success. In this study, we created experimental matrices to explore the effects of overload/underload combinations on fatigue crack growth in 5xxx aluminum. Both visual inspection of crack tip location and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) characterization of the crack tip deformation fields were used to characterize the crack growth in center crack tension (CCT) panel specimens. DIC also enabled additional analysis of strain fields to elucidate on the conditions responsible for the change in the crack growth behavior.

Major conifers distributed over diverse climatic conditions like the Japanese archipelago could show cone morphology variation among populations related to large differences in key influential factors such as temperature, snow, irradiance and sunshine. Geographical variation in cone characteristics (cone size, seed production, seed productivity per cone and seed size) was examined across the species distribution in 24 old planted Pinus thunbergii populations (479 trees) along two major seasides in Japan (Pacific Ocean side and Japan Sea side). Variance components of cone characteristics explained by seaside were at similar levels to those for populations nested within seasides. Populations on the Japan Sea side produced cones that had larger size (length and width), higher seed production (number of filled seeds per cone and seed mass per cone) and seed productivity per cone (seed-to-ovule ratio). Analysis of covariance showed that significant latitudinal clines observed in cone size and seed productivity per cone were mostly a result of inter-seaside differences. Linear mixed model analysis detected that geographical variation in cone size, seed production and seed productivity per cone in the populations were affected significantly by low temperature, more snow, less solar irradiance and less sunshine time. Large cone sizes and high seed productivity per cone found in the populations on the Japan Sea side could be explained by a genetic or plastic response to maintain reproductive success. ?? 2020 The Society for the Study of Species Biology",

A series of one-dimensional compression tests (with no lateral strain) were carried out on crushed coral sand with a variety of grading and relative densities (50%, 70%, and 90%) sampled from the South China Sea. Axial pressure was applied in stepped loading form: 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600 kPa. Each level loading was applied for 3 days and then completely unloaded until the deformation was stable, after which the next loading level was applied. The test results indicate: (i) the deformation of coral sand is much larger than silica sand and involves a larger proportion of time-dependent and plastic deformation; (ii) the total deformation of coral sand and proportion of irreversible deformation decreases as the relative density increases; (iii) coral sands of better grading tend to deform less in total and have larger proportions of elastic and time-dependent deformation; and (iv) the grading of coral sand changes during the deformation process due to particle breakage. Based on the test results, the relationships between particle breakage and pressure, relative density, and grading, as well as the grain-scale mechanism of the deformation, are discussed. ?? 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

Mitochondrial genome sampling is more comprehensive, but many phylogenetically important groups remain unsampled. Here, using a single-cell sorting approach combining tubulin-specific labelling with photopigment exclusion, we sorted flagellated heterotrophic unicellular eukaryotes from Pacific Ocean samples. We recovered 206 single amplified genomes, predominantly from underrepresented branches on the tree of life. Seventy single amplified genomes contained unique mitochondrial contigs, including 21 complete or near-complete mitochondrial genomes from formerly under-sampled phylogenetic branches, including telonemids, katablepharids, cercozoans and marine stramenopiles, effectively doubling the number of available samples of heterotrophic flagellate mitochondrial genomes. Collectively, these data identify a dynamic history of mitochondrial genome evolution including intron gain and loss, extensive patterns of genetic code variation and complex patterns of gene loss. Surprisingly, we found that stramenopile mitochondrial content is highly plastic, resembling patterns of variation previously observed only in plants. ?? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",

Distribution of microplastics (50- to 5000-??m size) was determined for three sandy beaches on an isolated island in a high-tidal costal region to elucidate spatial distributions in relation to beach locations. The abundances of microplastics (n = 21) measured were 56?€?285,673 (46,334 ?? 71,291) particles/m2 corresponding to the highest level globally. Out of observed polymer types, expanded polystyrene was overwhelmingly dominant. Although lying toward the estuary of the largest river in the country, the north-side beach contained a 100-fold lower abundance than two south-side beaches that faced southerly wind and currents that were prevalent throughout the study season. In addition, distinct differences between the beaches on either side were also present in terms of size distribution and spatial homogeneity of microplastics on the same beach. Winds and currents are therefore considered to be the driving forces in the distribution of microplastics. ?? 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York",

The majority of previous studies on anchors were mostly based on Finite Element Analysis, but the large deformation of soil was not well handled. This study applied smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate the anchor which buried in the soil. In this calculation, soil is modeled as elastic-perfectly plastic material, and the Drucker-Prager yield criterion is applied to describe the stress states of soil. Simulation test of anchor moved in the soil is calculated as a challenging example to verify the broad applicability of the SPH method. This study verified the feasibility of SPH in the numerical study of anchor and the results were encouraging. ?? 2020 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).",

Four dosages of the RPW additives representing 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8% by weight of the asphalt binder were investigated. The rheological characteristics of the RPW modified binders (virgin and SEA) are characterized at original and short-term aging conditions through the Rotational Viscometer (RV) and dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) tests. Fatigue performance is also characterized at the long-term aging condition. Also, high-temperature performance, dynamic storage stability (DSS), multiple stress creep and recovery (MSCR) are studied. Testing results show that RPWs lead to improved rutting and fatigue performance. Adding RPW to the virgin and SEA binders slows the binder oxidation reactions during the short-term aging. The Aging Index (AI) is found to be dependent on the asphalt rheological properties, amount/type of RPW, binder type, and temperature. RHDPE leads to an unstable modified virgin asphalt. Less than 4% RHDPE or 8% RLDPE with virgin asphalt show good DSS in terms of degradation and separation. The RPW with SEA meets the requirement of time degradation and separation set by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The temperature susceptibility of asphalt binder decreases dramatically with the RPW modification making the asphalt binder more suitable for use at a wider range of temperatures. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
TG87YT59,,Monitoring and performance evaluation of plastic cleanup systems: Part I - Description of the experimental campaign,"The Ocean Cleanup Foundation is developing floating barrier systems to concentrate and extract buoyant plastic from the global accumulation zones located in the subtropical convergence zones in the world's oceans. In that context, two cleanup systems have been designed, built and deployed in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch since 2018 to evaluate their performance in the field. During those campaigns, a large amount of data in terms of system displacement and environmental conditions has been collected. This data serves to further validate and calibrate numerical models that will be used to develop future generations of cleanup systems. The main performance indicator in scrutiny is the field efficiency which can be derived from on the one hand the barrier horizontal motion in terms of displacement and span heading and on the other hand the plastic transport around and inside the barrier. This information then needs to be correlated to the background environmental conditions to evaluate the barrier's efficiency over a longer deployment period and allow multidecadal hindcast analysis. To describe both the experimental and numerical work, this paper is split in two parts. This first part is dedicated to the presentation of the experimental setup in terms of barrier displacement, environmental conditions and surface transport measurements. This paper details the techniques employed to carry out those measurements, how they are processed but also the short comings of some measurement methods. ?? 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

SVCPNGBM,,Energy absorption properties of CFRP composites tube with discontinuous plies,"The carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite with overlapped discontinuous plies have been proven to exhibit advanced pseudo-ductility. This paper aims to use a similar concept to design CFRP square tube and investigate the effect of energy absorption capability with two cut-ply strategy: i) the cut direction had an angle of ?? tilted respect the loading direction which is the axial direction of the square specimens; ii) the cut direction had an angle of ?? tilted follow the fiber orientation. The quasi-static axial compression tests are conducted to explore failure process, crashworthiness characteristics and the corresponding energy absorption mechanisms. Experimental results showed that cutting angle ?? and ?? have a significant influence on the energy absorption performance. Increasing the angle of ?? from 15?? to 70?? led to an increase in specific energy absorption (SEA) from 51.0J/g to 73.1J/g. On the contrary, SEA decreased (from76.7 J/g to 56.9 J/g) with increasing ??. However, they all exceed the SEA of continuous specimen (56.2J/g). This work demonstrates that the energy absorption performance of composite tubes can be improved by proper selection of cutting strategy and cutting angle. ??

The study was carried out in the Paris region under sinewave and hold-time fatigue loading. The role of the microstructure in accelerating or retarding fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) and the phenomena responsible for the variations in the FCGR are comprehensively examined. The effects of the material phase morphologies, environment, waveform, crack-tip loading condition, corrosion products and the influence of cyclic microplastic zone on FCGR are also discussed. The microstructural analyses were performed using scanning electron microscopy and the observations are interpreted in conjunction with the experimental results obtained from FCG tests performed in air and seawater (SW). This work suggests that the nature of the microstructure of ferrite-pearlite steel has a strong influence on the FCGR in the Paris region of the da/dN vs. ??K sigmoidal curve both in air and SW.

Therefore, it is essential to identify pollutants in these environments, including large (1 mm to ??? 5 mm) and small microplastics (SMP) (1 ??m to ??? 1 mm). Here, SMP were identified and characterized in the windward (WW) and leeward (LW) beaches of Fernando de Noronha Island. Samples were collected from 900 cm2 quadrants on the strandline of 15 sandy beaches and were sieved through stainless steel sieves with 1 mm mesh. The SMP were characterized according to their shape, colour, and size. Synthetic fibres and fragments were identified, and synthetic fibres were predominant. Statistical differences were not found between the WW and LW beaches (160.0??137.5 particles m-2 and 128.0??84.3 particles m-2, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test: U=198.5; p=0.81) in relation to the total amount of SMP deposited on the beaches. Also, both types/ shapes were present in the two groups of beaches (Friedman?€?s test, X2 r=6.09; p=0.91). The environmental forcings controlling the transport and potential deposition of synthetic fibres may have been different from those acting on fragments that more resembled the grains of sand in the beaches.

2KBQMATX,10.1155/2020/8875315,Deformation Characteristics of Soft Marine Soil Tested under Cyclic Loading with Low Frequency,"Soft marine soil which could be found widely at the coastal and offshore areas is usually associated with high settlement and instability, especially under cyclic loading. Many research studies have been conducted on its deformation characteristics under the cyclic loading with high frequency, whereas few works have been reported on that under the low-frequency cyclic loading which largely existed in engineering. In this work, a comprehensive series of undrained triaxial tests under cyclic loading with low frequency was conducted to investigate the deformation characteristics of soft marine soil. The results demonstrate that soil specimens accumulate plastic deformation and pore pressure under cyclic loading. Specimens tested under conditions such as high confining stress, high-stress ratio, and long cyclic period generally reveal higher deformation and pore pressure. Meanwhile, the rectangular wave presents the largest contribution to plastic strain and pore pressure, followed by the trapezoidal and triangular waves, respectively, whereas the difference between the various waves decreased gradually with the increasing load level and cyclic period. The undisturbed specimens displayed lower deformations and pore pressures than the reconstructed specimens, whereas the differences are not significant when the confining stress is much higher than the structural yield stress. Furthermore, an empirical model for predicting the evolution of pore pressure is proposed and then validated against the experimental data in both this work and the literature. ?? 2020 Yu Lu et al.",
7UEDI4KI,10.1117/12.2574026,Remote sensing detection of plastic waste: Recent improvements and remaining challenges,"The presence of plastic litters in the environment (both onshore and offshore) has long been identified as a threat for the ecosystems. Remote sensing provides an efficient and quick access to concentration areas of plastic litters. Due to composition similarities between plastics and hydrocarbons, absorption wavelengths are expected for plastics around 1730 and 2310 nm. Kuhn's Hydrocarbon Index can be used for the detection of plastic targets on a hyperspectral aerial product. Spectral comparison algorithms (Spectral Angle Mapper and Spectral Information Divergence) as well as a spectral unmixing algorithm are used. J. Bioucas-Dias SISAL and MVSA algorithms are adapted for the automation of endmembers selection. Those previous results obtained in a controlled environment were expanded upon by using previous plastic detection algorithms as well as an index-based method (Flooding Debris Index; Biermann et al., 2020) on Sentinel 2 multispectral products. Using a cut-off value on the results of the FDI in southern Spain, onshore greenhouses and offshore plastic debris were detected. A supervised classification complemented the method, based on optical properties of five hundred greenhouses roof and five hundred non-plastic targets. In addition to plastic detection on land, we assessed temporal distribution of threadlike film presence at the sea surface on radar images in the North Atlantic. Wind conditions derived from Sentinel-1 images also help to understand the detection conditions. Spectral band configurations of free constellation of Earth observation satellites are not covering plastic absorption peaks which represent a significant limitation for their detection. The spatial resolution of commercial satellites (i.e Worldview-3) may be better adapted to plastic waste detection that have size distributions lower than open access satellite constellations. Even if offshore plastic detection with open access constellations remain challenging, image processing techniques may improve the detection. ?? 2020 SPIE",
AV3RKH6E,,Multi-objective optimization in waste plastics - Recycling vs thermo-valorization,"In the past few years, waste management has received increasing attention not only from industry but also from academics. With an increase in plastic content, motivated by China's ban on its import, waste composition is expected to change in the near future. Plastic is also considered a major pollutant if not handled properly, particularly for soils and oceans. Although recycling of plastics is well established for PET, a whole range remains that needs handling and treatment. Waste plastics are incorporated in a much wider treatment system and are decisive in contributing to waste calorific value. By providing separate collection routes and by increasing recycling, lower amounts are available for combined heat and power in typical thermo-valorization units, which demands the use of conventional fossil fuel alternatives to supply the needs. In this study, a multifunctional economic and environmental optimization is performed, covering the treatment of waste plastics by means of mixed integer linear programming. Multi-objective optimization was conducted to evaluate various designs. Solutions result in a trade-off between costs and emissions, with 8 designs beating current waste management solutions, with proper thermo-valorization challenging recycling processes in environmental impact assessment. Furthermore, costs can be reduced up to 20-fold, while environmental impact showed a potential for up to 20% reduction compared to the BAU scenario. This research allows new ways of considering the benefits and disadvantages of recycling and thermovalorization, as it pretends to be closer to real systems considering real world trade-offs and decisions, challenging current views and beliefs. ??

In light of the scientific evidence regarding the fate, persistence and toxicity of microplastics in the marine environment, many countries have banned the sale of rinse-off cosmetics containing plastic microbeads to prevent their release to the environment. However, the wider lifetime environmental impacts of the potential substitutes have not been considered, and care must be taken so that the environmental costs of using them do not potentially outweigh the benefits resulting from the bans. In this study, we use life cycle assessment to compare the environmental performance of a wide range of potential alternatives. The study investigates the quantities of these materials required and the human health and environmental impacts of their manufacture, transport and inclusion in cosmetics. We highlight that the long-term environmental and human health effects of their disposal are unknown and are thus excluded from the life cycle assessment. In support of the responsible replacement of plastic microbeads in cosmetics, we identify several alternatives that will perform better, as well as substitutes that could pose additional risks and have undesirable effects. ?? 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",

While many studies have been conducted in marine environments, studies in freshwater ecosystems are scarce and insufficient. The Paran?? River is the most important water course in the La Plata River basin and the fifth in the world with a mean annual discharge of 18,000 m3 per second. Currently available studies show the presence of plastic in river shores and fish gut, but more research should be carried out in order to know the extension and origin of plastic contamination. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify and characterize macro-, meso-, and microplastics found in the riverine beaches next to Rosario city, the most populated city standing by the lower Paran?? River coast in Argentina. The results show that plastic pollution is ubiquitous, but the city shores are significantly more polluted than the wetland shore with a mean of 30,780 and 6375 microplastics per square meter respectively (p = 0.024). The food and beverage industry packaging combined were the most frequent macroplastics found. Also, 3 out of 4 meso- and microplastics were white/transparent, the color that is most likely to be ingested by fish and invertebrates. Finally, all micro- and mesoplastics found were secondary and, in the case of microplastics, they were mainly fibers (93.4%) which highlight its ecological relevance. As a whole, plastic contamination is a serious issue in the Rosario area, specially single-use plastics and short-lived products. The anthropic effect of the cities and how it contributes to plastic pollution are evident. ?? 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

U2J82X8F,10.1115/OMAE2020-18564,Feasible numerical technique for analysis of offshore pipelines and risers,"A simple 2D numerical model for pipeline and riser configuration analyses is presented. The model considers large deformations of the pipe, pipe-seabed contact detection, pipe's interaction with uneven inelastic seabed, environmental loading such as drag forces applied by the ocean currents, water surface level variations and incorporation of buoyancy modules. The solution technique is based on a consistent minimization of the total potential energy of the deformed pipe discretized as a Riemann sum, which results in a system of nonlinear algebraic finite difference equations that is solved in an incremental/iterative manner. At each increment, the total potential energy is being updated, thus accounting for energy dissipation due to irrecoverable plastic deformation of the seabed and according to hydrodynamic drag forces. The whole pipe is treated as a single continuous segment. To demonstrate the method, examples with several riser configurations and pipe-lay scenarios are presented. It is shown how on-bottom unevenness, including pits and hills, incorporation of buoyancy modules and tidal effects can affect pipeline or riser configurations and their internal forces. Results are compared to those obtained with Abaqus and appear to be in an excellent agreement. The model presents simple and time-efficient way to analyze the pipe-lay or riser configurations with various boundary and loading conditions. The proposed model, contrary to commercial packages, which impose using time-consuming Graphical User Interface (GUI), allows for performing the series of analyses for varying geometric and/or material properties, and processing the results in reasonable time by single click.

However, the current detection approaches often require complex optical instrumentation and a long time for image processing. Furthermore, because of the difficulties of particle sampling, it is hard to collect a dataset with sufficient images and a balanced distribution. Digital holography, which is a non-destructive imaging method, is suitable for the in situ imaging. In this work, we propose a novel digital holography microplastics classification system which combines deep learning and generative adversarial networks. We experimentally show that our method yields a higher accuracy for microplastics classification and can efficiently reduce the imbalance ratio of the dataset. This method can be modified for other in situ image classification tasks that likewise suffer from a small and imbalanced distribution dataset. ?? 2020 SPIE.",

Marine plastic pollution is a global problem, and increasing effort and funds are being invested towards identifying and implementing solutions. It is well accepted that the implemented solutions should take into account local specificities and culture, which requires the involvement and engagement of local decision-makers and key actors. This paper presents how the DeCyDe-4 method, which is based on a participatory decision-support concept, was implemented to develop community-based policy tools and action plans to combat marine litter. Through a presentation of the step-by-step implementation of the method at a 3-day workshop in the Paphos District of Cyprus, the DeCyDe-4 method is unfolded so as to showcase how a multi-disciplinary group of local stakeholders can co-create a Policy Tool, and identify and prioritize measures and solutions to marine litter. The case study shows that DeCyDe-4 can support a varied group of stakeholders to negotiate a complex environmental problem such as marine litter, and to make informed, unbiased decisions, through a process that encourages active participation and dialogue, so that opposite opinions are heard, consensus is reached and ownership of the solutions is achieved.

Analyzing the consumption behavior of plastic bags of households in Ecuador,"Disposable plastic bags are one of the most used items by families worldwide, however, their excessive use and lack of re-use culture, have made them one of the most polluting materials on the planet. Disposable plastic bags can take up to 200 years to degrade, and their impact on the environment is reflected in the destruction of nature (landscape), alteration of marine ecosystems, and effect on human health. Understanding the behavior of households regarding the use of this type of material is key to undertake actions that lead to a reduction in their use. Therefore, this research aims to analyze the sociodemographic, economic, housing, social participation, and environmental perception factors that influence the decisions of households in using disposable plastic bags or reusable items, when shopping. It was found that homes, where the head of the household are women, are more likely to use non-plastic bags when shopping. In addition, heads of households with more education are more likely to use cloth bags or reusable materials than less educated ones. Furthermore, when the head of the household willingly participates in social organizations, the probability of using plastic bags decreases. It was also found that the urban population is more likely to use plastic bags than the rural population. Furthermore, families from the Andean region show better pro-environment behavior.

Nest entanglement and consumption of plastics can be a cause of mortality in chicks of various seabird species. As plastic debris may be chosen as a source of nesting material, evaluation of its presence and contribution to nest building in seabird colonies is important. Here, we determined the contribution of anthropogenic debris to nest construction by a yellow?€?legged gull Larus michahellis population that largely depends on refuse tips to forage. Two colonies within the southeastern Bay of Biscay, Spain, were sampled in 2019. One of the colonies was in Getaria, where no debris was found in nests, and the second was in Ulia, where 40 % of the nests had some kind of artificial material. In all cases, however, this debris comprised less than 5 % of the nests' area. Among the studied nests, we found one had a piece of fabric, five had pieces of rope, and 20 had pieces of flexible plastic packaging. These results contrast with other seabird species that face problems of conservation due to the increasing use of plastic for nesting. With the low prevalence of artificial debris (chiefly plastic) in nests found in this study, mortality due to debris entanglement or ingestion is unlikely. ?? 2020 Museu de Ci??ncies Naturals de Barcelona.",

Paper made of cellulose is attractive in terms of its favorable biodegradability, resource abundance, large manufacturing scale, and low material cost, but is usually hindered by its inferior stability against water and poor mechanical strength for plastic replacement. Here, inspired by the reinforcement principle of cellulose and lignin in natural wood, a strong and hydrostable cellulosic material is developed by integrating lignin into the cellulose. Lignin as a reinforced matrix is incorporated to the cellulose fiber scaffold by successive infiltration and mechanical hot-pressing treatments. The resulting lignin-cellulose composite exhibits an outstanding isotropic tensile strength of 200 MPa, which is significantly higher than that of conventional cellulose paper (40 MPa) and some commercial petroleum-based plastics. Additionally, the composite demonstrates a superior wet strength of 50 MPa. Adding lignin also improves the thermostability and UV-blocking performance of cellulose paper. The demonstrated lignin-cellulose composite is biodegradable and eco-friendly with both components from natural wood, which represents a promising alternative that can potentially replace the nonbiodegradable plastics. ?? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Two different parameters were considered in this test: types of cement and fiber. An experimental campaign was developed involving uniaxial compression tests and the use of digital image correlation (DIC) method to analyze the strain distribution and crack propagation of specimen. Test results indicated that the compressive strength and elastic modulus of SWSSCC were improved by adding stainless steel fibers (SSF), while polypropylene fibers (PF) enhanced the SWSSCC peak deformation. It was found that the elastic modulus and strength of SWSSCC using ordinary Portland cement (OPC) were higher compared to specimen with low alkalinity sulphoaluminate cement (LAS). Typical strain distribution changed with the variation of fiber types. The propagation and characteristics of cracks in SWSSCC containing PF were similar to those of cracks in SWSSCC. However, the propagation of cracks and the development of plastic deformation in SWSSCC were effectively hindered by adopting SSF. Finally, an analytical stress-strain expression of specimen considering the influences of fibers was established. The obtained results would provide a basis for the application of SWSSCC. ?? 2020, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.",

SZSWT9LV,10.2523/iptc-19841-abstract,Safaniya Lagoon Biodiversity Sanctuary,"Among the many goals of environmental management in Saudi Aramco, protection of special environmental areas is recognized as high priority to both the company and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In line with this objective, Safaniya Onshore Producing Department (SONPD) designated Safaniya area sea water lagoon as Biodiversity Area. The area is estimated to be 6 km2 peninsula, which is located in the north east of the Safaniya Producing Plant, where undisturbed native flora combines with a pristine shallow sea water lagoon, and provide a safe place for land wildlife (foxes, rodents, reptiles), marine wildlife (turtles, shrimps, fish, mollusks) and birds (flamingos, seagulls, etc.). Establishment of the Safaniya Lagoon started with surveying Safaniya and Tanajib Area, in collaboration with Saudi Aramco Environmental Protection Department (EPD) to select the most suitable region for biodiversity development. An establishment procedure was followed to secure the area with fences to limit the accessibility and prevent improper usage. A signboard was installed to identify the area as a sanctuary, forbidding entrance or any type of land use. Site development included mangrove plantation, already existing trash clean-up, and observation any type of waste dumped in the area, to ensure no contamination or danger to the habitat in the lagoon. The department successfully cooperated with Saudi Aramco EPD to plant more than 9,000 mangrove seedlings at the first two years of development. SONPD in collaboration with Society of Advocates and Volunteers for the Environment (S.A.V.E) invited employees with their respected family members to participate in a biodiversity beach clean-up campaign. The campaign helped collect more than 300 kg of waste, consisting of plastic bottles, old ropes, wood, and other waste materials. SONPD, along with its partners and programs, has now established the Safaniya Lagoon ecological and biological diversity sanctuary as a permanent refuge, with in-place protection and future mangrove planting events planned, the area is expected to expand in biodiversity with native flora and fauna, and expand a natural breeding and hatchery. During the winter season, migratory birds - such as flamingos and Amur Falcons, with flyways that pass over Safaniya Lagoon - are seeking warm weather and abundant food supplies. Creation of biodiversity is just the beginning of further area development. The next phase of sanctuary enhancement will be reutilization of tertiary treated wastewater for trees, which will form a wind barrier for mangroves.

Then the sound recorded by the dodecahedron microphone which was connected to Adobe Audacity software. Processing impulse response data used the Real-Time Analyzer program. The concrete test material was made from a mixture of plastic, sawdust and rice husk in a ratio of 30/70, 50/50, and 40/60. The sound absorption test was carried out in an enclosed 3.5x3.5 m2 acoustic laboratory. The concrete block, which was a mixture of plastic and rice husk with a ratio of 30/70, was the best material for absorbing sound. The sound could be absorbed up to 1.2 decibels, while the mixture of plastic and rice husk with a ratio of 60/40 was the lowest material in the ability to absorb sound. High-capacity concrete blocks could not only absorb the noise but also be used as building space separating materials. ?? 2020 by authors,.",
GI5YNLRF,,Statistical analysis of in-line interaction of closely spaced cylinder arrays in random waves,"Closely spaced cylinder arrays are widely used in offshore platform designs. When subject to random waves and currents, their interactive response behavior is very complicated and perhaps beyond the ability of direct analytical formulations to model their motions. In this study extremal statistics methods were utilized to analyze model basin data that investigated the response behavior of in-line paired and triple deep-water cylinder arrays. The cylinder models used in the model basin experiments were constructed with an ABS outer plastic shell that surrounded an inner steel wire core that could be pretensioned. The cylinder model diameter ratio of the outer shell to steel wire was 4.25 with a slenderness ratio of approximately 1300. The cylinder arrays were pretensioned on the top side and were tested varying pitch to diameter ratios of 3.0, 4.4, and 8.75. The random sea states were simulated using a JONSWAP spectrum. The response time series were investigated using generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions that were fitted to the block maxima that represented the maximum in-line relative displacement between two adjacent tendons. The most appropriate models were selected by comparing their goodness of fit via the Anderson-Darling (AD) test criterion with special attentions paid to their performance in fitting the upper tail of the distribution. The selected models were then used to predict threshold-crossing probabilities of the cylinder array relative response behavior. Both tabular and graphical interpretations of the findings are presented and discussed. ?? 2020 ASME",

We collected litter items from 235 trawls conducted to assess fish abundance off South Africa. Only 17% of trawls contained litter (3.4 items??km???2, 2.1 kg??km???2 but only 0.2 kg??km???2 excluding four megalitter items). Plastic items predominated (88%), of which 77% floated once cleaned of epibionts. One LDPE bag manufactured three months before being caught carried pelagic goose barnacles Lepas anserifera, confirming that biofouling leads to rapid sinking of floating plastics. Fishery/shipping wastes comprised 22% of litter items (98% by mass; 73% excluding megalitter items); the remainder was general waste ?€? mostly packaging or other single-use items ?€? that could come from land- or ship-based sources. Litter was more abundant in deep water close to Cape Town. The annual demersal trawl survey is a useful way to monitor seafloor litter off South Africa. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
IJSEQPCF,10.2495/WM200011,Biodegradable plastics fragmentation in soil and water: Lessons learnt and comparative assessment with hydro-biodegradables,"In the current climate, there is a surge of controversy surrounding the topic of plastics. Undeniably and unavoidably, plastic has become a crucial part of this generation. However, the inappropriate disposal of plastic waste, as well as the increase in consumption, provokes serious environmental issues. The rising environmental awareness on a global scale has imposed considerable pressure for associated authorities to take actions. This includes the research into alternative options to conventional plastics which is latched on to a negative reputation. Nevertheless, the greenness of these so called environmentally friendly alternatives is often questionable. Since April 2015, the European Parliament and the Council established Directive (EU) 2015/720, has amended Directive 94/62/EC with regards to reducing the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags. Subsequently, the directive aims to reduce the level of littering of these bags which accumulates in the environment where more plastic-related problems (i.e. marine pollution) aggravates. In this work, a comprehensive fragmentation analysis was conducted on biodegradable plastic bags claimed to be green and environmentally friendly for arid environments. Various biodegradable compounds were tested and verified for such claims in this work. The first stage of the experimental campaign involved conditioning the samples under UV (to trigger decomposition) until fragmentation is reached; and record the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy spectra every 72 hours. The use of a reference material for comparative analysis was also applied, and the material was chosen to be polylactic acid. Furthermore, fragmentation in water was conducted where the plastic is conditioned in an aqueous environment. Lastly, the samples were mixed with sand and mud, and weathering induced fragmentation was continued. Infrared analysis was undertaken and the rate of biodegradation was determined. The above analysis was also used to draw lessons learnt from this exercise for oxo and hydro-biodegradables; and how to best utilize them as a waste management mitigation strategy. ?? 2020 WIT Press.",
R26ZKQPJ,10.3906/ELK-2003-69,Highly sensitive fiber optic pressure sensors for wind turbine applications,"Fiber optic pressure sensors utilizing ultra-high sensitive fiber loop ringdown (FLRD) spectroscopy were fabricated using a bare single mode fiber. The fiber optic pressure sensors were applied to monitor pressure change on a plastic pipe embedded into a sea sand filled container in laboratory conditions to simulate a tower. As the pressure applied to the sensor head was changed from 66.4 kPa to 331.6 kPa, changes in the ringdown time (RDT) were recorded. The lowest baseline stability of 0.20% was obtained in these simple FLRD pressure sensors. The minimum detectable optical loss was 992 ??dB. The results showed that FLRD pressure sensors tested by applying to a pipe embedded into sea sand simulating a tower are highly sensitive and have high potential to be applicable for monitoring wind turbine components such as blades and towers in the sea or on land to determine the pressure on structures due to damage, excessive waves, or strong winds. The study also suggests that this type of FLRD pressure sensor can be utilized for the purpose of early detection in other important structures such as dams, buildings, and bridges. ?? T??B??TAK",

CAC fully utilizes local raw materials on remote islands. Due to the porous structure and low-strength characteristics of coral aggregates, CAC exhibits unique characteristics compared to ordinary concrete. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of the properties of CAC, including (1) the physical properties of coral aggregates; (2) the mechanical properties of CAC under uniaxial and multiaxial compression; and (3) the durability of CAC especially its chloride ion resistance and performance under drying-wetting cycles. To overcome the challenges of steel corrosion in marine environments, fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) has been indicated to be a promising material for applications in CAC construction. The latest studies on the combination of FRP and CAC are reviewed, including the use of FRP tubes and bars. ?? The Author(s) 2020.",
XYSA5MFT,,Nonlinear dynamic and bilinear fatigue performance of composite marine risers in deep offshore fields,"Composite materials have drawn considerable consideration from the offshore business, basically because of their high explicit quality. Notwithstanding weight decrease, composites offer extra advantages, for example, fatigue resistance, damping, and thermal (protection) properties, and high erosion resistance. As a part of design procedure there are requirements of mechanical strength based on criteria referring to failure modes, such as rupture by over loading, fatigue failures, buckling or an unstable fracture. Three dimensional nonlinear assessment of riser is carried out in time domain using ABAQUS/Aqua. The response time histories so obtained are used for the study of fatigue safety assessment of riser. It is based on a bi-linear approach to model fatigue crack growth and incorporates a failure limit to describe the interaction between rupture and plastic failure. Using Monte Carlo Simulation, tests of fatigue reliability and fa tigue crack size evolution are obtained. It is observed that bilinear S-N curve and crack growth models leads to higher estimate of fatigue life. Sensitivity behavior pertinent to limit state adopted has been thoroughly examined. These outcomes implicate assessment of components of the marine structures to ensure minimization of the surprises due to wide scatter of the fatigue phenomenon in marine environment. ?? 2020 ASME",

Those are characterised by high absolute energy absorption (EA) values yet low mass-specific energy absorption (SEA m). In contrast carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) reach higher SEA m values. The difference however is not a direct consequence of the density, weight specific stiffness or strength. Instead, the failure progression and hence the energy dissipation characteristics of metallic and CFRP structures are different. Whether a combination of the two material types leads to an increase or decrease of the SEA depends on the crash characteristics of the laminate which supposedly depends on the lay-up. The present paper reports on an experimental investigation on the crash behaviour of omega-shaped fibre-metal laminates (FML) composed of unidirectional CFRP prepreg layers and steel-foils under compressive axial loads. A potential of the tested hybrid laminates is proven by an increase of the mass-specific energy absorption value (SEA m) of 58%, compared to CFRP. ?? 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

The aim of this study was to examine the adverse effects of leachates of different virgin polymers, polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polystyrene (PS) on marine microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta. The tests carried out on D. tertiolecta included: growth inhibition, oxidative stress (DCFH-DA), and DNA damage (COMET assay). Polypropylene and PS leachates produced growth inhibition at the lowest concentration (3.1% of leachate). In contrast, a hormesis phenomenon was observed with PE leachates. An algae inhibition growth ranking (PP&gt;PS&gt;PE) was noted, based upon EC50 values. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated were increased with leachates concentrations with PS exhibiting the highest ROS levels, while a marked genotoxic effect (30%) was found only with PP. All leachates were free from detectable quantities of organic compounds (GC/MS) but showed the presence of transition, post-transition and alkaline earth metals, metalloids, and nonmetals (&lt;limit of quantification (LOQ) to 83.5 ??g/L). Therefore, the observed toxic action might reasonably be attributable to the presence of metals and in conjunction with polymeric actions.

Effects of NaCl of seawater on the strength of seawater sea sand concrete and on the deterioration of fibre-reinforced polymer were studied. Accelerated degradation tests were conducted on fibre-reinforced polymer rings exposed to a combined environment of 3.5% NaCl solution and seawater sea sand concrete. Obvious hoop strength reductions were observed in glass fibre-reinforced polymer and basalt fibre-reinforced polymer rings after 6-month exposure at 60??C. Seawater sea sand concrete?€?filled glass fibre-reinforced polymer tubular stub columns were exposed to an indoor environment (i.e. aged in air at room temperature) for a maximum duration of 2.5 years and no degradation was found by comparing the axial compressive test results from unexposed and exposed specimens. Seawater sea sand concrete?€?filled stainless steel tubes did not show any deterioration in strength after a 2.5-year exposure to an indoor environment or a 1.5-year immersion in NaCl solution. This study indicated that a hydrothermal environment (e.g. full immersion in solution) is much more aggressive to fibre-reinforced polymer than a dry environment. The reliability of using accelerated degradation test data to estimate the long-term performance of fibre-reinforced polymer?€?related structures in a real environment may need further research. ??

U53BFBRQ,,Very efficient ship-to-ice interaction simulations using user-subroutine of a commercial finite element code,"It is important to ensure structural safety of icebreakers subjected to impact loads by various sizes of sea ices. A new approach is proposed to predict the resistance due to ship-to-brash ice interaction without modeling fluid domain. The real time hydro-forces can be applied to ice floes considering ice kinematics. The surge motion by the proposed technique was compared with CFD results. A Korean icebreaker research vessel was employed to simulate navigation through brash ice channel. Uniform ices were modeled keeping concentration ratios constant. The brash ices were modeled as rigid, elastic, two plastic materials. Simulation results based on the rigid and elastic material models are in good agreement with test result. Intentional increase of the drag coefficient in rigid material model led to a result consistent with the experimental results. Simulation time of the elastic material model was four times longer than that of the rigid material model. ?? 2020 Taylor and Francis Group, London.",

Glass-epoxy elbow pipe joints using E-glass and S-glass were fabricated via the hand layup method. The pipe joints were immersed in water as per the current conditions for 0, 3 and 6 months. The relation between the unaged and aged samples was studied by calculating the contact force, displacement and absorbed energy values from the impact tests. Therefore, it is concluded that sea water raised the ageing period of both E-glass/epoxy and S-glass/epoxy fibre-reinforced composite elbow pipe joints which resulted in the degradation between the fibre and resin interface and which was prominent in the elbow joints fabricated with E-glass rather than the one?€?s fabricated with the proposed S-glass fibre. ??

To face this problem research has been performed around the world to study the presence of microplastics in marine environments. However, the use of different on-field sampling and laboratory characterization techniques, sometimes difficult to replicate, hinders the possibility to compare results. This paper proposes a methodology for sampling and characterization of microplastics on the 1 ?€? 5 mm range present on sand beaches. First, a comparison is made between the different techniques used for sampling, extraction, classification and identification of microplastics on studies performed on the last five years. Then the proposed methodology, which involves sampling in the high tide zone, at 5 cm depth, is explained in detail. The method has a low cost, as it uses simple equipment available in most of the labs. It can be easily replicable and allows presenting results in different units. The decision criteria, materials and steps in each of its seven stages (identification of sampling zone, selection of sampling points, sampling, drying, extraction, quantification and classification of microplastics) are described. Also, it explains a process to eliminate false positives caused by organic matter or shells.

In the Philippines, Balayan is one of the municipalities in the province of Batangas that is popular for its Bagoong Balayan. Chemical profiling from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be used to determine aroma-inducing compounds that are specific to this local variant and for quality assessment for food safety. In the meantime, the emerging pollution in the marine environment from persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and microplastics are alarming and threats to food safety. These marine-derived commodities, such as fish pastes may therefore harbour these kinds of pollutants. In this study, Bagoong Balayan samples were subjected to solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 29 compounds were detected that passed the minimum match factor of 80 and 14 of them were common in all collected fish paste samples. Some of these compounds were also reported to be in fish paste samples produced in other Asian countries. However, five of them were observed to be found only in Bagoong Balayan, namely 1-octen-3-ol, 1-octen-3-one, 2-nonanone, tridecane, and 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane. No traces of POPs were found in Bagoong Balayan samples. The presence of microplastics was seen in all of the samples after centrifugation, vacuum filtration, and inspection using a microscope.

The present study aims to elucidate the toxicity of polyethylene (PE) MPs (diameter = 10?€?22 ??m) to the typical freshwater rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus. Firstly, fluorescent microscope observation showed that rotifers could ingest PE MPs and accumulate them in their digestive tracts. Life-table experiments revealed that exposure to 0.5 ?? 103, 2.5 ?? 103, and 1.25 ?? 104 particles/mL PE MPs significantly reduced net reproductive rate and intrinsic rate of pollution increase of rotifers under algal densities (Scenedesmus obliquus) of 0.1 ?? 106, and 0.5 ?? 106 cells/mL, but no significant effects were observed under 2.5 ?? 106 cells/mL algal density. These results showed that PE MPs suppressed the reproduction of rotifer and this negative effect could be alleviated by increasing food supply. The swimming linear speed of rotifers significantly decreased with increasing MP concentrations. The activities of superoxide dismutase and Na+-K+-ATPase significantly decreased in treatments with high concentration of PE MPs under 0.1 ?? 106 cells/mL algal density, but did not change significantly in MP treatments under 0.5 ?? 106 and 2.5 ?? 106 cells/mL, compared to the control.

Exposure to PE MPs might lower the gathering capacity of algae, induce oxidative stress, trigger cell membrane damages and disturb energy metabolism in rotifers, which can explain the PE MPs toxicity to rotifer reproduction. ?? 2020",

Statistical data shows that plastic production alone will contribute to at least 20% of the annual global carbon budget in the near future. Hence, several alternative methods are recommended to overcome this problem, such as bio-product synthesis. Algae consist of diverse species and have huge potential to be a promising biomass feedstock for a range of purposes, including bio-oil production. The convenient cultivation method of algae could be one of the main support for algal biomass utilization. The aim of this study is to forecast and outline the strategies in order to meet the future demand (year 2050) of plastic production and, at the same time, reduce CO2 emission by replacing the conventional plastic with bio-based plastic. In this paper, the analysis for 25%, 50% and 75% CO2 reduction has been done by using carbon emission pinch analysis. The strategies of biomass utilization in Malaysia are also enumerated in this study. This study suggested that the algal biomass found in Malaysia coastal areas should be utilized and cultivated on a larger scale in order to meet the increasing plastic demand and, at the same time, reduce carbon footprint. Some of the potential areas for macroalgae sea-farming cultivation in Sabah coastline (Malaysia), comprised of about 3885 km2 (388,500 ha) in total, have been highlighted.

AT53SCR9,10.1128/mSphere.01151-20,Environmental Consortium Containing Pseudomonas and Bacillus Species Synergistically Degrades Polyethylene Terephthalate Plastic,"Plastics, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from water bottles, are polluting our oceans, cities, and soils. While a number of Pseudomonas species have been described that degrade aliphatic polyesters, such as polyethylene (PE) and polyurethane (PUR), few from this genus that degrade the semiaromatic polymer PET have been reported. In this study, plastic-degrading bacteria were isolated from petroleum-polluted soils and screened for lipase activity that has been associated with PET degradation. Strains and consortia of bacteria were grown in a liquid carbon-free basal medium (LCFBM) with PET as the sole carbon source. We monitored several key physical and chemical properties, including bacterial growth and modification of the plastic surface, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. We detected by-products of hydrolysis of PET using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) analysis, consistent with the ATR-FTIR data. The full consortium of five strains containing Pseudomonas and Bacillus species grew synergistically in the presence of PET and the cleavage product bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (BHET) as sole sources of carbon. Secreted enzymes extracted from the full consortium were capable of fully converting BHET to the metabolically usable monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol. Draft genomes provided evidence for mixed enzymatic capabilities between the strains for metabolic degradation of TPA and ethylene glycol, the building blocks of PET polymers, indicating cooperation and ability to cross-feed in a limited nutrient environment with PET as the sole carbon source. The use of bacterial consortia for the biodegradation of PET may provide a partial solution to widespread planetary plastic accumulation. ?? 2020 Roberts et al.

Pull-out failure, splitting failure and splitting-pullout failure modes were observed during the test. The slip at the free end always lagged behind the slip at the loading end and the bond-slip curve of ribbed basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars included the micro-slip stage, slip stage, descent stage, and residual stage. Reducing the bond length and using ribbed-sand coated bars were beneficial to improve the bond performance. Increasing the bond length from 2.5d to 5d reduced the bond strength by 49.2%. The application of ribbed-sand coated bars instead of plain bars increased the bond strength by 1202.3%. The difference in bond strength between steel bars, BFRP bars and glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars was small and the bond strengths of the three were much greater than that of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars. This was mainly attributed to the different rib forms of the bars. The application of stirrups increased the bond strength by 11.5%, which indicated that the stirrup restraints can improve the bond behavior to a certain extent. Besides, the analysis of the bond-slip curve based on the energy perspective was consistent with test results. ?? The Author(s) 2020.",
5LPPNDFN,,Monitoring and performance evaluation of plastic cleanup systems: Part II - results and analysis,"The Ocean Cleanup Foundation is developing floating barrier systems to concentrate and extract buoyant plastic from the global accumulation zones. In that context, two cleanup systems have been designed, built and deployed in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch since 2018 to evaluate their performance in the field for which a large amount of data has been collected. This data serves to validate and calibrate numerical models that will be used to develop future generations of cleanup systems. The main performance indicator in scrutiny is the field efficiency which can be derived from on the one hand the barrier horizontal motion in terms of displacement and span heading and on the other hand the plastic transport around and inside the barrier. After a first part dedicated to the presentation of the experimental campaign carried out to evaluate the field efficiency of the second cleanup system, this second part is dedicated to the presentation of some results and analysis performed to evaluate the interception efficiency. This paper first focuses on the cross comparison of two measurement techniques to evaluate the barrier span length and heading, second the metocean models in terms of waves and wind are presented and compared against the available metocean measurements. Then, a multi-linear model is proposed to evaluate the barrier dynamics from the background metocean conditions and applied to the analysis of the barrier in the lifting bag configuration. Finally, the multi-linear model is compared to measured relative speed for all the drifter tests carried out in the campaign the whole test campaign. ?? 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

GR7M9LS5,10.1016/j.gete.2019.100177,Macroscopic effects of nano and microscopic phenomena in clayey soils and clay rocks,"Based on long term investigations of the microstructure of various geomaterials as different as sensitive low plastic clays from Eastern Canada, unsaturated compacted silt from the Paris area, highly plastic compressible deep marine clay from the gulf of Guinea, compacted MX80 bentonite and the Callovo?€?Oxfordian claystone, considered as possible barriers in deep geological radioactive waste disposal, two fundamentals and distinct nano and micro mechanisms governing their macroscopic volume changes have been identified. In low plastic structured clays and dry compacted soils, in which an aggregate microstructure has been evidenced, the decrease in volume under mechanical compression result from the collapse of inter-aggregates pores in an ordered manner, from the larger to the smaller, with no effect on the intra-aggregate porosity. The soil skeleton can hence be modelled as an elastic fragile porous matrix, affected by the ordered collapse of its pores. Things are different in plastic soils, due to the significant reactivity of the montmorillonite minerals to changes in water content that results in significant changes of the initial porous matrix. The ordered adsorption of layers of water molecules in clay platelets with respect to the suction or stress applied, evidenced long time ago in Soil science through X-ray diffraction techniques, appear to be able to help better understanding various phenomena like the compression of plastic compressible soils and the hydration of compacted bentonites. Interestingly, it also applies to understand the effects of smectite minerals in the volume changes behaviour of the Callovo?€?Oxfordian claystone. These two mechanisms at nano and microscopic scales hence provide a better understanding of the macroscopic volume changes of a large variety of natural and compacted clayey soils and rocks. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Moreover, the presence of this litter highlights a transport of polluting material even at considerable distance from anthropized areas. Finally, the presence of scavenger species (an endemic lizard and terrestrial molluscs) feeding on food remains could suggest an assimilation of litter into the trophic webs. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Two significant landfill constituents are textile waste and discarded plastic bottles. Since there is a finite amount of space available for landfill use, solutions that reuse these post-consumer products are imperative. The work presented here is a methodology for producing natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites (NFRPCs) from pseudo-raw materials. Post-consumer textile waste and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water bottles were made compatible by way of surface modifications. Melt compounding was used to form a monofilament feedstock for extrusion-based 3D printing platforms. Hydrolysis and functionalization of cellulose fibers from white denim cloth was performed. It was found that adding recycled textile fibers to the recycled PET matrix had a toughening effect. Materials characterization involving dynamic mechanical analysis, attenuated total reflectance, impact testing, melt flow index, and scanning electron microscopy were carried out to verify the efficacy of the functionalization process and to ascertain the robustness of the filler/matrix interface. The outcome is a demonstration of a feasible method for the repurposing of waste products for 3D printing applications. ?? 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",
XSH99QNT,10.3354/DAO03527,Ingestion of foreign materials by odontocetes along the Catalan coast: Causes and consequences,"Ingestion of abnormal materials by cetaceans has been reported worldwide, but few studies have investigated the causes of foreign material ingestion. We retrospectively analysed necropsies performed between 2012 and 2019 on 88 cetaceans stranded along the coast of Catalonia, Spain, and evaluated the association of abnormal ingested materials with 2 risk factors, namely disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and maternal separation. Abnormal materials were found in the digestive tract in 19 of 88 (21.6%) cetaceans; of these, 13 (60%) had lesions in the CNS, such as morbilliviral encephalitis, neurobrucellosis or encephalomalacia, and 3 were diagnosed as having experienced maternal separation. In a logistic regression model, CNS lesions and maternal separation were identified as risk factors for ingestion of foreign material, but with wide confidence intervals, probably due to the small sample size. In contrast, abnormal ingestion was not identified in any of the 25 (28%) cetaceans whose cause of death was attributed to interaction with humans. Abnormal ingestion should be interpreted with caution, and efforts should be made at necropsy to exclude CNS diseases through pathologic and microbiologic investigations. If disease of the CNS is a significant risk factor for ingestion of marine debris by small odontocetes, results of monitoring programmes may be biased by the prevalence of CNS disease in a specific area or population. ??

ERJ4U84I,10.4081/jlimnol.2020.1958,Microcosm on a bottle: Experimental tests on the colonization of plastic and glass substrates in a retention reservoir,"The last few decades have seen a dramatic increase in water pollution due to various types of waste generated by human activity. These include plastic and glass accumulating in the shore area of lakes and oceans. These substrates may be colonized by various groups of aquatic organisms. Little is known of the trophic interrelationships between micro-and macroorganisms colonizing Plastic (PB) and Glass Bottles (GB). Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to determine the taxonomic composition and abundance of micro-and macroorganisms colonizing artificial, anthropogenic substrates, the trophic relationships between the organisms colonizing these substrates, and the influence of the physicochemical properties of the water on the formation of such assemblages. Studies of micro-and macroorganisms were carried out on the surface of PB and GB in a eutrophic retention basin. Both the species richness and abundance of microorganisms and metazoa were found to be determined by the type of substrate colonized as well as by the physico-chemical properties of the water (primarily the content of total organic carbon and biogenic compounds). Furthermore, the trophic structure of microbial assemblages demonstrated seasonal variability. In spring, the substrates were colonized by typical bacterivorous ciliates, whereas in the following seasons there was a larger share of omnivorous species (ciliates and rotifers). This may indicate that the accumulation of various types of anthropogenic waste, in the present case GB and PB, may contribute to changes in the matter and energy cycle, including the carbon cycle, in various microhabitats of aquatic ecosystems. ?? the Author(s), 2020 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.",
3LBMZR2G,10.1155/2020/8891436,Wellbore Stability of a Deep-Water Shallow Hydrate Reservoir Based on Strain Softening Characteristics,"Deep-sea hydrate has great commercial exploitation value as a new type of energy, due to huge reserves, wide distribution, cleanliness, and lack of pollution. Accurately, prediction of the mechanical properties of hydrate reservoirs is a key issue for safe and efficient exploitation of deep-sea hydrate. Although there have been some experimental and numerical simulation studies on the borehole stability of the hydrate layer, the influence of temperature and flow on the decomposition ofreservoir hydrate is still not well understood. There have been few pure mechanical studies on the stress and strain state of the hydrate formation around the well, and it is impossible to intuitively understand the influence of the wellbore on the original stress state of the hydrate formation. This paper therefore uses a discrete element method to establish a deep-water shallow hydrate reservoir borehole stability model and compares the discrete element numerical model with an elastoplastic analytical model of borehole stability to verify the reliability of the numerical model. A simulation study on the influence of factors such as reservoir depth and hydrate saturation on wellbore stability is carried out. The simulation results effectively present the constitutive characteristics of strain softening of hydrate sediments. According to the different mechanical characteristics,the near-well zone can be divided into a plastic strain softening zone, a plastic strain hardening zone, and an elastic zone. Reservoir depth and hydrate saturation are found to change the stress state near the well. The greater the depth and the lower the hydrate saturation, the greater the borehole shrinkage. The diameter of the optimal horizontal well in the goaf is in the range from 0.6 to1.2 m. ?? 2020 Wenrong Feng et al.",
IMY9X49N,,Effect of fiber packing on moisture diffusivity and tortuosity in fiber reinforced composites,"Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composites are widely used in marine environment due to their high specific strength, increased durability and corrosion resistance property. But these materials when subjected to seawater absorb moisture that results in the reduction of material strength due to matrix plasticization and reduced interfacial strength due to de-bonding at the fiber-matrix interface. To ensure long-term durability and damage tolerance, it is important to understand the impact of moisture diffusion and moisture-induced damage in composites. To that end, the goal of this paper is to elucidate the importance of fiber packing and orientation on moisture diffusion such that CFRP composites can be optimally design for marine applications. In this paper, we developed computational models within finite element method to study the long-term response of CFRP composites subjected to moisture conditions. We developed two-dimensional micromechanical diffusion models with varying fiber volume fraction and different fiber distribution like square, hexagonal and random array to study the influence of fiber packing on the effective diffusivity and moisture saturation. Specifically, we elucidated the influence of tortuous diffusion pathways that manifest due to these micromechanical geometric properties of CFRP. ?? ASC 2020.",
T8BUM52H,,The role of small-scale manta ray tourism in eastern Indonesia's marine protected areas,"Manta ray watching tourism worldwide has been reported to bring a significant economic impact that contributes to the effective management of sustainable wildlife tourism. This study was conducted to analyse the role of small-scale tourism businesses in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) of Nusa Penida, Komodo, and Raja Ampat, both in Indonesia, that offers manta ray tours and determines their significant contribution to the park management. We conducted surveys with 101 respondents from manta ray tourism services and phone interviews with three park managers. The results of this study indicate that more than 90% of respondents engage in conservation activities. The small-scale businesses include boat rentals, gear rentals, dive shops, tour operators, homestays and souvenir shops that promote manta ray conservation through their products and services; educating tourists and staff, collecting plastics when diving and snorkelling, regular beach clean-ups, waste management, recycling programs, manta ray monitoring and photo ID activities. Furthermore, the Marine Protected Area (MPA) management confirmed by establishing a partnership with the small-scale manta ray's tourism businesses to ensure the authentic manta ray experience for tourists and achieving sustainable businesses for the locals. In summary, there are three significant roles of small-scale manta ray tourism business including species protection, sustainable tourism compliance, and effective MPA management that still needs to be strengthened to provide maximum benefits to conservation and tourism. ?? 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",
3U44T52T,10.1177/1369433220947897,Durability of glass-fibre-reinforced polymer composites under seawater and sea-sand concrete coupled with harsh outdoor environments,"This article presents an investigation on the durability of different glass-fibre-reinforced polymer composites when subjected to harsh outdoor conditions, including freeze/thaw cycles, ultraviolet radiation and moisture, as well as when used with seawater sea-sand concrete for construction applications. To achieve this, the effects of a number of parameters, including the environment of exposure, exposure time, profile cross-sectional configuration and orientation of fibres, on the mechanical properties of different glass-fibre-reinforced polymer composites were studied. To investigate the degradation of the mechanical properties, three-point bending, compression and tension tests were conducted on both reference and conditioned samples. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed to examine the contribution of microstructural deterioration to the damage mechanisms of the conditioned composites. Finally, the test results were used to develop empirical regression models to predict the level of retention of mechanical properties of different composites under different environmental conditions. The findings showed the maximum flexural, compressive and tensile strength reductions to be 35%, 48% and 37%, respectively, with regards to the pultruded profiles exposed for 3000 h to freeze/thaw cycles followed by 90 days of seawater sea-sand concrete immersion, while the flexural strength reductions recorded for the vacuum-infused samples subjected to 2000 h of freeze/thaw cycles followed by 90 days of seawater sea-sand concrete immersion were 28%, 72% and 56% for the unidirectional, woven and chopped strand mat laminates, respectively. ??

In this work, an environmentally friendly, effective, facile, and CO2-based foaming technique was presented to fabricate microcellular polypropylene (PP) foams with BCS via blending with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The toughness, thermal properties, rheological properties, and foamability of PP were systematically investigated with gradual incorporation of TPU. Representative sea-island structure was observed in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for the fracture surface of various PP/TPU samples. Rheological measurement results demonstrated that the viscoelasticity of various PP/TPU samples was improved remarkably compared with that of pure PP and pure TPU. The impact strength of various PP/TPU samples possessed the highest value as 12.4 kJ/m2 with the TPU content of 15 wt%. After the addition of TPU, an ameliorative cellular morphology was observed in the SEM micrographs of various PP/TPU samples and their volume expansion ratio was enhanced significantly thanks to their improved melt elasticity. Moreover, it is worth noting that BCS appeared in various PP/TPU foams when the TPU content exceeded 5 wt%. ?? 2020 Society of Plastics Engineers",
CIALS8NJ,10.1002/aqc.3236,Assessing the effectiveness of restoration actions for Bryozoans: The case of the Mediterranean Pentapora fascialis,"Marine ecosystems are highly affected by several human stressors. In this context, beyond passive restoration measures such as the creation of marine protected areas, it is urgent that we explore active restoration measures to enhance and accelerate the recovery of sessile marine species. Bryozoans are among the most common sessile invertebrates in rocky bottom ecosystems and are considered habitat-forming species that are highly vulnerable to physical disturbances, such as recreational diving, ghost fishing nets, and global warming, which makes them highly vulnerable to other impacts. Despite their ecological importance and vulnerability, to date restoration actions for bryozoans have rarely been explored. In this study, different restoration techniques were developed and tested, with a focus on two types of effective methodologies previously applied to other marine invertebrates: recruitment enhancement and the transplantation of adult colonies, in both cases using the Mediterranean bryozoan Pentapora fascialis as a model species. First, different types of artificial surfaces were installed in different coralligenous habitats to test the enhancement of recruitment, concluding that plastic grids are the best substrate in terms of facilitating the recruitment of new bryozoan colonies. Second, different methodologies were tested for adult transplantation. The most successful was to fix colonies to a suitable substrate with a nylon thread attached to the colony ex situ (i.e. on the boat). Using this technique a trial restoration programme was undertaken, involving transplanting adult colonies collected from a ghost fishing net trapped on the bottom, which showed a high survival rate of 50% after 6 months. The low economic cost of the implementation of the proposed techniques as well as the successful results obtained highlight the viability of restoring bryozoan populations over long temporal and spatial scales. ?? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
UELIA5VY,10.1115/PVP2020-21328,Development of the buckling evaluation method for large scale vessel by the testing of gr. 91 vessel subjected to vertical and horizontal loading,"Larger-diameter cylindrical vessels for commercial fast breeder reactors (FBRs) are planned to increase the electric generation capacity with thinner vessels compared to the existing ones. The modified 9Cr-1Mo steel (ASME Grade 91 steel) has high yield stress and low tangent modulus after yielding, and plans to be applied as well as austenitic stainless steel for vessels in existing FBR power plants. Although elasto-plastic axial compression, bending and shear buckling are expected to occur in vessels, the current buckling strength evaluation from the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers (JSME) standard ?€?Design and Construction for Nuclear Power Plants, Division 2 Fast Reactors?€? mainly focuses on plastic buckling of thick cylindrical vessels. Seismic base isolation is being devised for next-generation FBR power plants by the increasing seismic design load in Japan. When a horizontal seismic base isolation design is adopted, cylindrical vessels are subject to cyclic vertical seismic load with long-period horizontal seismic wave. The deformation by cyclic vertical load reduces the buckling strength. In this paper, we modified the existing buckling strength equations focusing on elasto-plastic axial compression, bending and shear buckling under cyclic axial load (hereinafter called ?€?modified equations?€?), and confirmed their applicability through a series of elasto-plastic buckling analyses. We also conducted a series of buckling tests on Grade 91 steel vessels in the load regions where axial compression, bending and shear buckling interact, and where axial compression and bending buckling are dominant due to large vertical load. The buckling behavior and the buckling load estimated by the elasto-plastic buckling analysis considering the actual material stress-strain relationship and imperfections in the test vessel suitably agreed with corresponding test results in the load regions. ?? 2020 ASME",

In this study, an analytical method was proposed to examine the internal crack development in glass fiber reinforced polymer?€?sea sand concrete composites. The method was derived by analyzing the strain dissipation and shear-lag behavior. Thus, the internal cracks can be quantitatively identified by the proposed model with Fourier transform analysis. The proposed approach was experimentally verified through pullout tests for the specimens with artificial cracks. The results indicated that the prediction errors were less than 10%. In addition, the piezoelectric sensors were adopted to verify the proposed model. A damage index (DI) defined by the energy loss of received signals was used to characterize cracks inside the composite. Loading test results indicated that the DI-calculated cracks were consistent with the proposed analytical model. Finally, the cyclic loading tests of the glass fiber reinforced polymer composite were conducted using both strain gauges and PZT sensors. The results have shown that the differences between the proposed approach and PZT sensors were less than 15%. Thus, the proposed approach in this study could provide an alternative approach for quantitative evaluation of internal cracks in the glass fiber reinforced polymer?€?coral sand?€?cement composites. ??

Dunaliella sp. used in this study was taken from stock available at the Aquaculture Technology Laboratory of the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Sciences, Sam Ratulangi University, Manado, Indonesia. The cell of Dunaliella sp. is motile and its shapes vary from ellipse to cylinder. Cell length varies depending on the shape of the cell. Radial symmetry shape has about 2.8-40 ??m. Seawater used as the culture medium was taken from clean sea waters and far from settlements. Sea water was filtered using 0.45 ??m filter paper with the help of an aspirator, then diluted with distilled water until it reached a salinity of 20 ppt. Microalgae Dunaliela sp. were cultured using walne medium in the culture chamber with a temperature of 25?? C, salinity of 20 ppt with 20-watt tube light irradiation. Algae harvesting was done when the algal density had reached the exponential phase by calculating the density of microalgae every day using a haemocytometer assisted by a light microscope. After the algae reached exponential density, the samples were treated with lead acetate at 30, 50 and 80 ppm. After harvesting, the algae were centrifuged and subjected to the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) analysis. The specimens were prepared through a standard preparation of Plastic Block (Resin) consisted of fixation, dehydration, infiltration, embedding and curing. The density of microalgae was calculated using a haemocytometer under a light microscope. The research results showed that the density of Dunaliella sp. was not significantly different conidering different concentrations of lead acetate. The density of Dunaliella sp. had no relationship with the cell structure of each concentration of lead acetate used.

Utilizing multi-materials such as aluminum-steel in the automotive industry poses some manufacturing challenges in terms of joining technologies of dissimilar materials. Clinching is a cold forming process that includes severe local plastic deformation of the sheets leading to permanent mechanical interlock. This study undertakes the experimental investigation of bending energy absorption of the clinched top-hat thin-walled beams by means of a series of quasi-static three-point bending tests. Different types of clinched beams including homogeneous as well as hybrid material beams, with aluminum alloy Al5052/SPCC mild steel and Al5052/SPFC 390 high strength steel combinations, are studied. The bending behavior of such beams under two different loading conditions is investigated and compared in terms of crashworthiness indices such as specific energy absorption (SEA), initial peak force (Fip) and crash force efficiency (CFE). It is found that although the hybrid clinched beams show higher SEA as well as lower Fip than their steel counterparts, their CFE values are lower than the steel beams. Furthermore, the sheets arrangement change with respect to the punch and the die is shown to influence the energy absorbing capability of the hybrid clinched beams. Moreover, it is revealed that while the clinched beams show reduced Fip under the load applied to their hat-shaped part, they exhibit lower CFE values compared to when the load is applied to their plate part. Finally, considering SEA, Fip, and CFE as three criteria, TOPSIS as a multi-criteria decision-making method is employed to select the best compromise design solution. ?? IMechE 2020.",

The arcuate failure scars occurs in water depths exceeding 600 m. The fan-shaped body, less than ca. 10 km long in radius, displays strong backscatter intensity in sonar images, and corresponds to the uppermost transparent mass in Chirp sub-bottom profiles. Sediment cores penetrating to the uppermost transparent mass consist mostly of various facies of mass-transport deposits (MTDs), causing the strong back-intensity in the sonar images. The interval of MTD facies comprises the upper and lower units without hemi-pelagic muds between them, implying that the fan-shaped body was probably deposited during a single event separated in at least two stages without a significant time break. The lower unit shows brittle to plastic deformation of soft muds (slides/slumps), whereas the upper units exhibits fully fragmented soft mud clasts (low viscous debris flows). Both the upper and lower units involve same original lithology (i.e., soft hemi-pelagic mud) prior to failures, suggesting that the lithology could not significantly affect depositional processes. The fully fragmented soft mud clasts of the upper unit are probably indicative of more shearing than the brittle to plastic deformation of soft muds in the lower unit. Considering the small dimension of the failure scars/gully and the same original lithology, the more shearing of the upper unit was most likely caused by longer transport distance than that of the lower unit. The rare turbidites with absence of channellevee systems in the fan-shaped body and the failure scars confined in the upper to middle slopes suggest that the submarine gully probably formed by slope failures, not by erosion of turbidity currents. ?? 2020, The Association of Korean Geoscience Societies and Springer.",

Despite a wealth of information relating to the accumulation of MPs in aquatic species, there is little information on the uptake of MPs by terrestrial plants. Information about location of MPs in plant tissues is critical to understand the modes of their interaction with plants. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the most commonly used plastic polymers worldwide and it is often found in MPs sampled in the environment. The performance of traditional detection methods (i.e., transmission electron microscopy, TEM and scanning electron microscopy, SEM) for nanoparticles is limited due to the extensive sample preparation and the limited field of view.

Environmental MPs have been shown to exhibit different physicochemical properties during their life cycles. However, the body of knowledge regarding their accumulation and biological effects is still significantly limited compared to manufactured MPs. To evaluate the hazardous effects of a mixture of environmental MPs collected along the Tunisian beaches, their accumulation and cellular effects were investigated in Hediste diversicolor. MP sample was composed of polyethylene (PE), polyethylene vinyl acetate (PEVA), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyamide (PA) analyzed using Raman microspectroscopy (RM). The concentrations of MPs in seaworm tissues increased over time, following the order 1.2?€?0.45 ??m > 3?€?1.2 ??m > 100?€?3 ??m. The ingestion of MPs by H. diversicolor reduced their survival and growth, affected the neuro-transmission and antioxidant pathways.

In this study, the prevalence of microplastics (MPs) in freshwater fish from farmed and natural sources was investigated. Oreochromis niloticus from aquaculture farms in the Huila region in Colombia, and two local species (Prochilodus magdalenae and Pimelodus grosskopfii), naturally present in surface waters were sampled. Of the particles identified, fragments were the predominant type in the three tissue types (stomach, gill, and flesh) derived from farmed and natural fishes. MicroFT-IR spectroscopy was conducted on 208 randomly selected samples, with 22% of particles identified as MPs based on spectra with a match rate ??? 70%. A total of 53% of identified particles corresponded to cellophane/cellulose, the most abundant particle found in all fish. Not all fish contained MPs: 44% of Oreochromis farmed fish contained MPs, while 75% of natural source fish contained MPs in any of its tissues. Overall, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyester (PES), and polyethylene (PE) were the prevalent MPs found in the freshwater fish. A broader variety of polymer types was observed in farmed fish. The edible flesh part of fish presented the lower prevalence of MPs compared to gill and stomach (gut), with gut displaying a higher frequency and diversity of MPs.

6AQ9FMH7,,Waves in the great pacific garbage patch: Cross validation of three measurement techniques and two WW3 models,"The Ocean Cleanup Foundation is developing floating barrier systems to concentrate and extract buoyant plastic from the global accumulation zones. To analyze and improve the efficiency of such cleanup systems, access to accurate Metocean conditions is inevitable. The Ocean Cleanup runs its own implementation of WAVEWATCH III?? to have full control over the spatiotemporal resolution and to have access to all critical output, such as 2D wave spectra or Stokes drift at the surface to only name two examples. We present here an experimental campaign that was carried out during the deployment of the first two systems in the Pacific to A) validate the performance of both a GFS and CFSR forced wave model, 1000+nm from available NOAA buoys and B) intercompare the wave measurements from an unmanned surface vessel (USV) with those from wave buoys and a vessel based XBand radar. The USV is the most feasible tool to collect long periods of data along the system trajectory and our preferred option in the long run. We zoom into one day to review in detail the various data sources, their comparability and employed post processing techniques. We present a preliminary comparison of integral wave parameters for the entire campaign (2272hrs/data points) and discuss further steps towards a more complete investigation. The preliminary comparison suggests that the USV and wave buoy data compare rather well. The largest differences are seen in wave periods. We observe small differences between the GFS and CFSR forced model, both compare well with the field measurements. ?? 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All rights reserved.",

These fossil fuel derived films are associated with long degradation time, toxicity and environmental pollution. Pineapple waste, sea weed can be very good renewable, alternative carbon sources to produce edible films. These edible films can be consumed by lower animals thereby overcoming the disposal problems of accumulating waste plastic and hence reducing pollution. In the present study, crosslinked polymers are prepared from pectin (P)/sodium alginate (SA) through crosslinking with bio-based acids such as citric acid (CA) and tartaric acid (TA). Pectin was extracted from waste pineapple shell and sodium alginate extracted from seaweed.

I3DJ7MWN,10.1177/1464420719882958,Analysis of thick-walled spherical shells subjected to external pressure: Elastoplastic and residual stress analysis,"When cylindrical and spherical vessels are subjected to the internal pressure, tensile tangential stresses are created throughout the thickness, the maximum of which are located at the inner surface of the vessels. To improve the performance of these vessels, autofrettage process has been devised to produce beneficial compressive residual stresses at the inner part of such vessels. The question arises whether the process such as autofrettage can be useful for vessels such as submarines or other thick walled tanks, which are used in deep sea waters and, therefore, subjected to high external hydrostatic pressure causing both radial and tangential stresses to be compressive across the thickness. On the other hand, is the residual stresses created by unloading from an external pressure beyond elastic limit beneficial and enhance their performances? In this study, elastoplastic and residual stresses in a thick-walled spherical vessel under external hydrostatic pressure has been investigated. The material behavior is considered to be elastic-perfectly plastic. Von Misses yield criterion is used to obtain initial yield point and for the ideal elastoplastic regime analytical relations are presented. It has been found that by applying external hydrostatic pressure yielding process will start from inside of the sphere. Finally after unloading, residual tensile stresses are created at the inner part of the vessel which is useful for the vessel. The residual stresses and the condition of reverse yielding is studied in this paper. ?? IMechE 2019.",

In this paper, a theoretical model for predicting the punching shear strength of FRP-RC slabs is developed. In this model, the punching shear strength is determined by the intersection of capacity and demanding curve of FRP-RC slabs. The capacity curve is employed based on critical shear crack theory, while the demand curve is derived with the help of a simplified tri-linear moment-curvature relationship. After the validity of the proposed model is verified with experimental data collected from the literature, the effects of concrete strength, loading area, FRP reinforcement ratio, and effective depth of concrete slabs are evaluated quantitatively. ??

Sexually-produced Sargassum seedlings can be propagated in a hatchery using 140-liter plastic tanks connected with PVC pipes and seawater supply directly pumped from the sea, passing through a filter system. ?€? First step of this method is to collect large amount of fertilized eggs from special branches called receptacles, found at the ends of lateral branches of Sargassum, excised from fertile thalli during its spawning season and collecting their eggs for recruitment into artificial substrate tanks. ?€? Egg collection involves force-releasing the fertilized eggs by vigorous shaking of a small vessel where 100-200 egg-bearing receptacles excised from fertile plants are contained.

Ghana?€?s coastal lagoons provide unique ecosystem services. However, they are highly fragile and vulnerable to natural processes and anthropogenic activities. Climate Change impacts, such as increased temperatures, sea-level rise, storm surge and increased precipitation are likely to have ecological damage to lagoon ecosystems as a result of erosion, submergence of lagoon barriers, flooding and drying of the surrounding wetlands. Field observation, Geographic Information System modeling were among the methodology applied. The paper identified that anthropogenic activities and Climate Change would combine to have a serious future impact on lagoon ecosystems. Particularly, increased rainfall-induced flooding from the hinterland may be very injurious to the lagoon ecosystem, since the flood water may carry not only nutrients but also various contaminants and solid plastic waste generated by human activities around lagoons catchment into the lagoon channels. Besides, due to the barriers across most lagoon inlets, such polluted runoff water may not be able to flush out to sea, thus impacting negatively on the water quality of the lagoons. The paper proposes some adaptation strategies and recommends the early implementation of Climate Change adaptation strategies, coastal lagoon management measures to prevent potential future destructive impacts. ?? 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
7SPDY89V,,Experimental evaluation of axial crush behavior of woven tubular laminates with a moving support condition,"The objectives of the investigation were to measure the specific energy absorption (SEA) of the plain-weave carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tubes, study the effect of tube length on SEA and stable crushing force, analyze the effect of using a crush trigger, and compare force-displacement data using different specimen support conditions. Dynamic crush testing of CFRP tubes was performed using the crash sled in the Impact Dynamics Laboratory at NASA Glenn Research Center. The sled features a movable mass that supports the specimen during crash testing. Laminated [??45]4 tubes were fabricated and tested using tube lengths of 102 mm or 152 mm each with a diameter of 76 mm. Sled impact velocities ranged from 6.15?€?6.48 m/s. In most tests, a crush trigger was applied to the front face of the tubes to initiate a crushing failure mode. The mean SEA of the tubes tested with the crash sled was 48.6 J/g. There were virtually indistinguishable changes in failure modes for the 102-mm and 152-mm tubes. Plots of acceleration and cumulative absorbed energy for both tube lengths were nearly identical, which suggests that the effect of tube length on crush behavior was negligible in the range of tested impact velocities. One of the 102-mm tubes was tested without a crush trigger to provide a direct comparison with a drop tower specimen that lacked a crush trigger. A higher peak force and lower SEA was measured for this specimen compared to the specimens that had a crush trigger. Both the peak force and stable crushing force were comparable for the drop tower and crash sled specimens lacking a crush trigger. However, the maximum crush displacement of the crash sled specimen was lower because a portion of the energy was absorbed by the motion of the support mass. ?? ASC 2020.",

In order to do so, a series of random copolymers of styrene (S) and vinyl benzyl chloride (VBC) were synthesized by free radical polymerization technique and subsequently, VBC (V) was functionalized with N,N-dimethylhexadecylamine to introduce quaternary ammonium (QA) salts in the backbone of the copolymers. The copolymers showed an excellent film forming ability, thereby providing an ultrathin coating on various substrates such as metal (stainless steel), glass, polyethylene and polystyrene, as observed by SEM.The coatings were found to be uniform, non leachable in aqueous medium and exhibit good adhesion to various substrates. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of the non-leachable coating of random copolymers were screened against B. licheniformis. Among, the copolymer containing 75% quaternized VBC (75VSQA) having 16-C long alkyl chain was found to show maximum antibacterial and antibiofilm activity owing to an appropriate hydrophobic /hydrophilic balance.

Previously, flame spraying of polymers has been successfully performed to obtain durable icephobic coatings, providing an interesting solution for applications facing icing problems, e.g. in marine, aviation, energy, and transportation industry. However, the fine tailoring of the process parameters represents a necessary strategy for optimising the coating production due to the unique thermal properties of each polymer. For this purpose, we vary the heat input of the process during flame spraying of the coating, by changing the transverse speed and the spraying distance. The results show that the variation in the process parameters strongly influenced the quality of the polymer coating, including its areal roughness, thickness, chemical composition, thermal stability, and degree of crystallinity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these properties significantly affect the icephobic behaviour of the surface within the spray window of the chosen parameters. In conclusion, the relationship between the thermal degradation of the polymer and the icephobicity of the surface was defined. This highlights the importance of process parameter optimisation in order to achieve the desired icephobic performance of the LPDE coatings. ?? 2019, The Author(s).",

The results indicate that the elastic-plastic plate will generate permanent deformation loaded by the water jet; owing to the deformation of the nearby structure, the bubble shows as a ""hazel"" in the bubble contraction phase and forms toroidal jet which leads the bubble into several toroidal bubbles in the bubble collapse phase.

This paper develops a research on the modeling of rotary-draw bending of copper-titanium composite tube by using two kinds of grid elements S4R and C3D8R, respectively. The contact problem of base tube and covered tube is set as coulomb friction contact mode, whose optimal friction coefficient is obtained by pressure-shearing experiment and its simulation. The springback model is established by considering the contact action of the two tubes. Finally, the S4R shell FE model is compared with the C3D8R solid FE model from the two aspects of section deformation and springback. It is found that the shell element model is accurate in predicting the springback and section deformation, while the solid element model has a large deviation from the experimental results in predicting the section deformation. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the plastic deformation behavior of the bimetallic composite tube, the tangential stress, equivalent stress, equivalent strain, and damage values have been studied. Results show that (1) there is no significant uneven deformation between the base tube and the covered tube, which will not produce obvious wrinkling and section distortion even without the filling of the mandrel dies. (2) Sliding and stratification are existing between the base tube and the covered tube in the bending process. (3) The force of the dies on the base tube is transmitted through the side surface contact between the base tube and the covered tube. (4) The maximum damage value of the covered tube is larger than that of the base tube. This research will promote the development of precise plastic processing technology and play a role in the research of secondary plastic forming of metal composite tubes. ?? 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",
TKIIYHG5,,Investigation of a novel wave energy generator using dielectric elastomer,"The type of electroactive polymer, known as dielectric elastomers, has shown considerable promise for harvesting energy from environmental sources such as ocean waves, wind, and human motions, etc. The high energy density and conversion efficiency of dielectric elastomers (DEs) can allow for very simple and robust ""direct drive"" generators. In such generators, a DE transducer is directly driven by the up and down motions of waves. These generators can be simple, low-cost and robust. The efficiency of a wave energy convertor using DEs was confirmed by our previous experimental work. In this study, a wave energy convertor using DEs was numerically investigated as a moored floating body. First, the numerical model is validated against existing benchmark experiments. Then the moored floating body is numerically modelled, and the simulated results are compared to physical wave tank tests. The analyzed conditions vary from single body, two bodies with different intervals, and three bodies. The fluctuation, energy absorption efficiency, as well as the influence of multiple moored floating bodies on each other are discussed. The purpose of present work is to clarify the influence of floating body intervals and number of floating bodies on the motions, the mooring tensions, as well as the power generation efficiencies for a plurality of floating bodies arranged in a series in head seas. This kind of optimal arrangement is expected to be popularized in the future, which may contribute to the increasing demand of renewable energy solutions. ?? 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

4BAGBF32,10.1115/OMAE2020-18737,Local buckling of dented subsea pipelines under the combined loadings,"Dents has long been regarded as a potential hazard for integrity of subsea pipelines in the oil and gas industry. The dents in subsea pipeline are usually caused by the collision and extrusion with other objects resulting in permanent plastic deformation in pipe wall. Meanwhile, seabed deformation or motion due to subsidence, mudslides, and seismic activities may load the pipeline to an ultimate state, where the pipeline is under combined external pressure and bending moment. It is of great importance to carry out the research on the buckling failure and bending capacity of dented subsea pipelines under these combined loads. Nonlinear finite element method is adopted to investigate the local buckling failure of the dented subsea pipeline under combined loads. The numerical results show that the buckling behavior and bending capacity of the pipeline can be largely reduced due to the existence of external pressure and axial force. Based on numerical results, a formula for predicting the bending capacity of dented subsea pipelines is proposed. Finally, the accuracy of propose solution is validated. Copyright ?? 2020 ASME.",

In Korea, many researchers are conducting studies on floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) on areas with suitable wind resources. In particular, Ulsan, which is the site selected in this study, started research on the development of a 200-MW floating offshore wind farm. In this study, the references for upscaling are the 5-MW reference wind turbine of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and the OC4-DeepCwind semisubmersible type floating wind turbine. We upscaled the 5-MW wind turbine to a 10-MW FOWT by applying the appropriate scale ratio for each component of the turbine. We upscaled the specifications related to items such as the blades, hub, and nacelle using the power ratio. The mass of the blades was reduced by using carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). We upscaled the specifications related to the tower using its deflection ratio, and the tower clearance criterion and the tower campbell diagram were used to confirm that the design is appropriate. We upscaled the specifications related to the platform using the upper structure mass ratio. The GZ curve of the platform was used to confirm the stability, and we used the air gap for safety. Three catenary type mooring lines were also designed. To understand the static response of the initial model of the 10-MW FOWT, a steady-state analysis was performed according to each wind speed.

The particulate composite with improved wettability of fillers and advanced approach can evolve polymer composites that exhibit promising applications in packaging, automobile, marine, construction, and aerospace. In the present work, one of the biowaste fillers were synthesized from Limonia acidissima shells via a top-down approach (pulverizing) and the surfaces were chemically modified using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) before they were used as fillers in vinyl ester polymer composites by different weight percentage (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt%). The prepared particulate composites were characterized by mechanical properties, moisture absorption behavior, and morphology. At different filler loading the tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, flexural modulus, impact strength, hardness, density, and moisture intake tests were performed. The results reveal that the properties increased for composites filled with alkaline treated fillers for the same filler loading and found to be higher at filler loading of 15 wt%.

Full-scale specimens with total lengths of 12000 mm and diameters of 600 mm were constructed and implemented with bending tests. Efforts were made to evaluate effects of non-prestressed reinforcement type and longitudinal reinforcement ratio on flexural performances of specimens. Meanwhile, J-factors were calculated to quantify deformability of all specimens. It?€?s experimentally demonstrated that PC piles reinforced with BFRP bars exhibit much higher flexural capacity than those with steel bars. Moreover, cross sections of all specimens basically conformed to the assumption of plane section. Failures of PC piles reinforced with BFRP bars were attributed to gradual concrete crushing, while those with steel bars were speculated to result from excessive crack width. A simplified method for predicting flexural capacities of PC piles reinforced with BFRP bars was proposed. The predicted flexural capacities using the proposed method were in good agreement with the experimental results. Results of this study were expected to provide theoretical basis for broadened engineering applications of PC piles reinforced with hybrid BFRP bars and steel bars in marine structures. ?? 2020, ?? 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
SWZK58I5,,A fundamental study on plastic strain accompanying deformation in large-scale floating coal transshipment station,"Indonesia is the main country supplying coal in the Asia- Pacific region, and in order to secure a stable supply of coal to neighboring countries, efficient coal transportation is required. East Kalimantan Island in Indonesia is the main coal-producing area, but the sea around the island is very shallow and bulk carriers for transporting coal cannot approach the coast. And then, Large-scale Floating Transposition Station for Loading Coal (hereafter LFTS) was proposed, which will be used as a transposition station between small coal barge coming down the river and bulk carriers that stays offshore. LFTS has a twodimensional extent, and because the bulkheads for separating coal according to quality are installed on the floating body, the rigidity is partially different, and the draft also changes greatly according to the coal loading condition. In this way, LFTS has different characteristics from Mega-Float, which was built in Japan in the late 1990s with the aim of realizing a floating airport, so it is important to clarify its structural characteristics. In order to grasp the stress distribution acting on the structural member in consideration of the influence of the interaction between the overall deformation and the local deformation of LFTS, an analysis in which the entire structure is modeled in detail is desired. However, because members such as the internal bulkheads are arranged in a complicated manner in LFTS, a model in which the entire structure is modeled in detail requires enormous calculation costs in both capacity and time, it is difficult to perform the analysis. In existing research, various models have been studied, but there remains a problem in setting boundary conditions that reproduce the interaction between global and local deformations. And then, in this paper, a new modeling method of LFTS that can be analyzed efficiently was proposed. And the occurrence of stress concentration in the structural members of the LFTS was identified by systematically changing the external force conditions such as the coal loading condition and wave load assumed during the operation of the LFTS, and performing LFTS oscillation analysis and stress deformation analysis. Furthermore, the occurrence of plastic strain due to large deformation was investigated. The stiffening method that efficiently suppresses the occurrence of plastic strain was studied for the locations where the plastic strain was identified by the above analysis. These results demonstrate the importance of modeling large floating structures with complex structures. Copyright ?? 2020 ASME.",

XDAT8P6A,,Carbon/polyamide 6 thermoplastic composites for underwater applications,"The composite materials used at sea are today nearly all based on thermoset resins (polyester, epoxy). However, there is an increasing number of thermoplastic matrix polymers available on the market (PP, PA, PPS, PEEK?€?), which offer possibilities for forming by local heating, attractive mechanical properties and the potential for end of life recycling. The main reasons for the slow adoption of these materials are that they require a completely different manufacturing route compared to the current materials, as they have a more complex microstructure, and that there is little experience with them, particularly for thick structures. The aim of this study was to design, manufacture and test thermoplastic composite pressure vessels for 4500 meter depth, in order to establish a technical, economic and ecological assessment of the use of these materials to replace traditional composites underwater. Finite element calculations have been carried out to optimize the stacking sequence with respect to the external pressure and buckling resistance. Thick thermoplastic cylinders were manufactured and tested until implosion, showing a good agreement with calculations. Overall the results show that it is possible to use C/PA6 thermoplastic composite cylinders for deep sea applications, as implosion pressures higher than 600 bar (6000 meter depth) were achieved. ??

Source identification by the positive matrix factorization model and conditional probability function indicated that P-PAEs were mainly from the release from indoor environment (43%), PVC source (34%), construction source (12%), and industry source (11%). Air mass transport from both inland and oceans affected the PAE pollution in non-typhoon season, while its long-range transport from oceans took an important role in typhoon season.

9W36H9SD,10.1061/9780784482810.076,Numerical Experiments of Seabed Liquefaction during Ocean Wave Loading,"Seabed soil behavior under ocean wave loading is important to understand for the safety of coastal infrastructure, e.g., breakwaters, wind turbines, coastal armoring. A two-dimensional finite element model is generated in OpenSees to simulate nearshore seabed soil reaction to progressive wave loading by coupling pore water pressure and soil particle displacement. Wave loading is applied at the surface of a two-dimensional rectangular seabed domain as vertical pressure as well as pore water pressure. The numerical model is justified by comparing with analytical solution using different material parameters. A parametric study on model boundary effects shows that for the same wavelength wave, effective finite element domain size is not related to the full domain size as long as the lateral domain size is at least one wavelength. Soil liquefaction potential at different locations is studied with changing wave frequencies. A standing wave situation is also examined to simulate an ideally fully reflected wave in front of a coastal structure. The node and anti-node location of the standing wave greatly affect the liquefaction potential prediction. The results show that the wave properties are important for predicting soil liquefaction depth as well as liquefaction initiation time. Soil parameters like hydraulic conductivity and the elasto-plastic material behavior would also have the impact to the liquefaction region size and magnitude.

In this paper, a composite material is presented that is corrosionresistant and can withstand the expected pressure and temperature conditions in the offshore environment.This material extrudes from a specially designed machine that takes wood and plastic wastes as feedstocks inappropriate ratios depending on the area of application on the facility. Upon laboratory analysis, this materialhas a melting point of 400degF (204degC), and load testing also revealed that at typical offshore conditionof pressure ??? 50bars and at about 100degC, this material would be very suitable for corrosion control.Furthermore, from an economic standpoint, this composite material is extremely cheaper with a cost of 300USD per foot of pipeline coating compared to about 2000 USD cost using conventional corrosion controlmaterials. In addition, with the implementation of this process, we have realized that negative environmentalcontribution of plastic wastes to greenhouse gases (GHGs) will be greatly mitigated, reducing the overalllevels to about 10%. In conclusion, a cost effective and an environmentally friendly corrosion protectioncomposite wrap has been developed by recycling wood and plastics wastes. ?? 2020 Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition 2020, NAIC 2020.All right reserved.",

From the plastic particles found in deep sea trenches to the unfolding of Earth?€?s sixth mass extinction, among many other indicators?€?notably anthropogenic climate change?€?it is clear that human impacts may have irreversibly perturbed the planet. This special issue sets out to deepen and broaden the conversation from a world-systems perspective. Building upon a long tradition of scholarship deploying world-systems theory to understand global environmental change, we wish to explore the past, present, and future of the world-system with/in the Anthropocene. In this introduction we first offer prefatory remarks about the Anthropocene (by no means a universally accepted concept) that are meant to help orient readers to debates around the Anthropocene before turning to a summary of the contributions and the themes that emerge in this Special Issue. ?? 2020, University Library System, University of Pittsburgh.

M7XS59EX,10.1007/s12633-019-0078-3,Determination of Strength Parameters of Glass Fibers Reinforced Composites for Engineering Applications,"The manufacturing of the composite material has been developed tremendously over the years due to its superior properties like low density, stiffness, lightweight and excellent mechanical as well as physical properties. These exceptional properties of composite materials have found its applications widely in aerospace, automotive, marine and many more engineering areas. The synthesis of the varieties of composites is continuously lookout without compromising its mechanical and physical properties. This paper deals in with synthesis as well as mechanical properties (Tensile Strength, Flexural Properties and Fatigue) of Glass-Epoxy as well as Glass-Vinyl Ester composites. The resins used in combination of composites were epoxy as well as Vinyl Ester while the reinforced material was glass fibers. The ultimate tensile strength in Glass-Epoxy composite was observed from 330 to 370 MPa while it was 270 to 330 MPa for Glass-Vinyl Ester Composites. Glass-Epoxy composites showed a 32% increase in flexural strength due to post-curing strength while it was 16% in case of Glass-Vinyl Ester Composites. The results of the fatigue analysis of composites indicate faster growth of cracks and defects at higher frequencies which results in a rapid drop in stress levels in the test specimen. The statistical analysis was carried out to establish mutual correlation among mechanical as well as physical properties. ?? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",
T7BSS79U,10.2112/JCR-SI111-041.1,Simulation of the failure process of submarine landslides on a seabed by coupled MPM,"Submarine landslides are large-scale natural marine disasters that commonly occur in coastal areas, which significantly threats important subsea infrastructures and offshore facilities. This paper presents a two-dimensional numerical model using the material point method and hydromechanical coupling to simulate a typical submarine landslide, named the Storegga Slide. The numerical simulation for modeling the submarine landslide, consisting of submarine clay with a strain-softening constitutive model, has provided information about the landslide failure process, as well as the failure mechanisms of retrogression deformation under the effect of water. The simulation reproduces the evolution process with a final deposit morphology, which is consistent with the previous investigation result. Based on the modeling, the landslide failure process, mechanisms, and plastic strain state are comprehensively discussed. It is found that because of the water effect, some distinct characteristics in the sliding process can be observed in submarine landslides: movement hinderance, a bulbous configuration, and high fluidization, which is valuable for disaster mitigation. ?? 2020 Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc..

56ZFZ432,,A novel approach to ornamental fish transportation for the aquarium hobbyist,"Fish transportation methods for fish culture operations, public aquariums, biologists, and researchers often employ methods and use equipment which the average aquarium hobbyist does not have access to. Aquarium hobbyists typically transport fish via sealed plastic bags that are inflated with oxygen and shipped by next day mail service or as cargo on commercial airlines, however, the build-up of ammonia and carbon dioxide limit the duration that fish can be kept within these sealed bags to approximately 24 to 36 hours. This study outlines a novel technique for fish transportation suitable for the aquarium hobbyist. This protocol allowed for the successful transport of three fish and one marine invertebrate for 7 days, with minimal effects on water chemistry and stress. The use of a standardized transport procedure such as the method outlined in this study may help to reduce fish stressors; thereby, reducing short-and long-term morbidity and mortality associated with the transport of fish. ?? 2020, Green Wave Publishing of Canada.

HGKEIBCD,,Structural strain approach for low-cycle fatigue life prediction of ship welded joints,"Fatigue life assessment of welded joints used in ship structures is of outmost importance and sometimes it is not sufficient to refer to the high-cycle fatigue regime, since high levels of plastic deformation can occur. The aim of this research activity is to study the low-cycle fatigue behaviour of welded joints commonly used in shipbuilding. Experimental tests were performed using the Digital Image Correlation technique, which is a non-contact full-field technique. The Digital Image Correlation technique allowed the detection of displacement and strain patterns, with particular attention to stress concentration areas. Furthermore, a Finite Element model, matched with the experimental data, was performed by applying the structural strain approach, which is mesh insensitive and requires only the elastic parameters. The values obtained from the structural strain approach were used to predict the fatigue life of the investigated welded joints. ?? 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",

EPV26U4A,,Building a comprehensive geomechanical model for chalk compaction. Phase 1: Model calibration from plug to reservoir scale,"The exploitation of chalk reservoir entails reservoir compaction and seafloor subsidence that can jeopardise the economic viability of a field. Despite the apparent monotonous aspect of chalk in the Danish North Sea, numerous geomechanical models were successfully applied to different fields to forecast rock deformation. The present study aims at building a geomechanical simulation approach capable of predicting compaction and seafloor subsidence in various reservoirs. Laboratory, well log and production data and in situ compaction measurements from different fields are reviewed to build a robust database used for model calibration. A strain-rate dependent constitutive model is implemented into Comsol Multiphysics and tested from core to reservoir scale. The results indicate differences in the elasto-plastic behaviour of Maastrichtian and Danian chalk. The back-analysis of uniaxial compaction tests shows that the hardening effect varies between rock types and a more pronounced effect is observed in Maastrichtian chalk. Model calibration for the rate-dependent deformation uses in situ compaction measurements collected in a producing reservoir over a seven year-long period. The results indicate that the rate-dependent behaviour of chalk is function of porosity and differs slightly between Danian and Maastrichtian chalk. Model calibration represents a key step to quantify chalk properties, which will be then used as input data to simulate compaction in different chalks fields. ?? 2020 ARMA, American Rock Mechanics Association",

The reason is that there are still more than 25% of the people who have not been able to use clean water to meet their daily needs. Indonesia was in the spotlight because it was considered as one of the countries that became the most significant contributor to water pollution, especially through plastic waste. The need for clean and safe water is growing as the population growth as well. Seawater desalination has become one of the essential commercial processes for providing clean water to many communities and industrial sectors that play an important role in socio-economic development in several developing countries, especially in Africa and several countries in the Middle East. The region, which suffers from the scarcity of fresh water. This paper aims to simulate the processing of seawater into clean water ready for use. The source of heat that is use comes from the cooling water condenser of steam turbine power plants. The method to be used is a thermodynamic simulation by using temperature in the cyclone separator and the percentage of water discharged into the sea variation to find out the amount of aquadest production and the Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) in the system. The lower temperature in a cyclone separator, the more aquadest production. The more mass water discharged to the sea, the less SEC will obtain. The minimum SEC is-1137.62 kJ/kg aquadest for 0.86 kg/s aquadest at 99% of mass water discharge and 2.645 kPa pressure in the cyclone separator and then the higher SEC is 440.53 kJ/kg aquadest for 0.338 kg/s at 89% of mass water discharge and 0.706 kPa pressure in the cyclone separator. The effect of lowering the condenser pressure is to increase the power of steam turbine 1181.85 kW, and then the cooling water temperature of the condenser decrease from 37.5??C to 32.5??C. The cooling water of condenser will be discharged partially into the sea at 32.5??C, which is safe for the environment. ?? 2020 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU.",

The EAF-Nansen Programme,"Seafood plays a central role in global food and nutrition security. However, there is a lack of data on the concentration of nutrients and contaminants in fish and other seafood, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In order to assess the potential risks and benefits associated with seafood intake, reliable and up-to-date food composition data is crucial. The quality of food composition data is affected by several factors, such as sampling protocols and the suitability and quality of the methods applied for sample preparation and analysis. In this paper, we describe the sampling methodology and protocols related to the sampling of fish and other seafood and the corresponding analytical methods used to analyse the nutrient and contaminant content of such species. For nutrients, the determination of protein, fat, ash, energy, fatty acids, cholesterol, and amino acids is described, in addition to analyses for determination of the vitamin and mineral content in fish and other seafood. For contaminants, analyses for the determination of organic pollutants and microplastics are described.

The insufficiency of proxy evidence on landscape and climate dynamics during the long Atelian regression (MIS 4 ?€? MIS 3) complicates the analysis of changes in the Caspian water balance. Traces of Late Pleistocene cryogenesis structures were catalogued in the alluvial and loess-soil deposits of the Srednyaya Akhtuba reference section. Four stages of permafrost development were described for the first time in the Lower Volga region. Under conditions of seasonal and longer-term freezing in the Late Pleistocene, cryogenic transformation of the deposits took place; this determined the composition, structure and properties of the loess-paleosol complex at the site. Cryolithological, micromorphological analyzes and particle size distribution of mineral matter were carried out for each horizon, and traces of cryogenic processes were described in order to evaluate the regional paleoclimatic conditions that prevailed during their formation. Optically stimulated luminescence dating was used to establish a chronological framework for the main phases of the development of cryogenic modification in the Lower Volga region. The fourth stage of formation involved deep cracking of the substrate, which occurred during freezing in MIS 4, coincident with the Atelian regression of the Caspian Sea. The third stage is expressed as large wedge-shaped structures (pseudomorphs) on the border of loess and alluvial packages, with their formation known to be associated with the degradation of ice wedges. During the second and first stages of freezing, plastic deformation of deposits occurred. ?? 2020 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA",
RA6QU7PY,,Thermoplastic infusible resin systems: Candidates for the marine sector?,"This work investigated the feasibility of the use of a novel infusible thermoplastic resin (Elium 150 from Arkema) for composite laminate manufacture by resin infusion methods and possible application in the shipbuilding sector. We compared the properties of Elium glass-fibre laminates with those of laminates infused with state-of-the-art thermosetting epoxy and urethane acrylate resins. The Elium laminates matched the mechanical performance (flexure and interlaminar shear strength) of the epoxy and surpassed that of the urethane acrylate counterpart. However, the mechanical performance of the Elium laminates after immersion in water at 35 oC for 28 days deteriorated compared to urethane acrylate, but was comparable in flexural properties to that of the epoxy. The combination of superior mechanical performance coupled with acceptable environmental resistance and comparable composite laminate manufacturing conditions makes the infusible thermoplastic a possible future candidate matrix over commercial thermosetting resin options. ??

YHTK9LAW,,Development of a numerical dynamic mooring model for visco-elastic and visco-plastic deformation of synthetic ropes,"Synthetic ropes are increasingly being considered for various offshore and marine applications, including for mooring offshore wind turbines and for aquaculture cages. Studies have shown that nonlinear behaviors of a synthetic rope in a dynamic environment can complicate the mooring system analysis. Nonlinear stiffness coupled with time- and load historydependent characteristics of fibrous materials can allow for over or under estimation of the mooring forces. It is critical that these nonlinear properties are incorporated correctly into a mooring model, especially for studies of structures' performances in extreme events. The study aims at developing a simulation tool capable of predicting the dynamic behavior of highly extensible synthetic mooring system used in coastal and offshore floating structures. The program employs an implicit finite-difference approach to model the dynamic behaviors of the mooring line subjected to user-defined motions of the fairlead. As opposed to a linear stress-strain relationship typically incorporated in other mooring models, the current program is built with constitutive model of fibrous materials to account for the nonlinearity timeand load- dependent characteristics of synthetic lines. As part of the program, an inverted constitutive stress-strain model, in which stresses are calculated from given strains in stress-based formulas, were presented. Comparisons with published data indicates that the proposed inverted nonlinear stress-strain formulas were successfully integrated with the mooring solver. The coupled nonlinear mooring program predicts accurately both nonlinear reversible and irreversible deformations of synthetic cables. ?? 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

VYFCBLX7,10.1117/12.2558402,Active deformation of dielectric elastomer for detection of biofouling,"Biofouling accumulation on synthetic underwater surfaces presents serious economic problem for the marine industry. When a substrate-bonded dielectric elastomer (DE) is subjected to high voltage, deformations in form of creases can be formed at the surface of the DE. This deformation, has been already demonstrated for the prevention and detachment of biofouling from the surface of DEs. In this work, we add sensing capability to the anti-biofouling effect of active DE surfaces. A device consisting of a metallic plate, a Kapton sheet, and a thin silicone membrane is immersed in conductive solution, which acts as one electrode, with the metal plate being the second electrode. Two different conductive solutions were used 3.5 wt% NaCl and 20 wt% NaCl. The surface deformation of the silicone as a function of applied voltage is monitored under microscope in order to verify electrical measurements. Breakdown measurements of the dielectric material in different conductive solutions are also performed. Because the membrane is made from incompressible elastomer and bonded to a rigid substrate, voltages below the creasing threshold create no deformation in the membrane, and therefore no change in capacitance. Above the voltage threshold, creasing instabilities appear at the surface of the silicone, thus increasing the capacitance of the device. Therefore, the capacitance of the sensor is measured as a function of applied voltage, and the voltage at which the capacitance increases is the threshold voltage at which creases occur. Creases are identified when using both 3.5 wt% NaCl and 20 wt% NaCl as top electrode. Theoretical values of creasing voltage deviate from the experimental measurements. Type of conductive solution is shown to have no significant influence on a breakdown voltage. ?? 2020 SPIE.",
AK5I6KEG,,Mechanical characterization of polymer composite materials for long length ships,"In the marine industry Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) are currently dominating the manufacture of vessels up to 50m in length, with liquid resin infusion (LRI) being the most frequently used manufacturing technique, of which vacuum-assisted liquid resin infusion is the most widely adopted LRI variant. However, current regulations (SOLAS from IMO) restrict the use of composite materials in vessels over approximately 50m in length. FIBRESHIP is a Horizon 2020 funded EU project that aims to further the use of FRPs in vessels over 50m in length by addressing the regulatory restrictions and the numerous other challenges associated with manufacturing long-length FRP composite ships. The mechanical performance of new commercially available composite materials as potential candidates for selection in composite ship construction is central to this work. This paper provides an overview of selected work performed as part of the FIBRESHIP project in terms of evaluating various mechanical properties of selected laminates under dry and wet conditions. Test samples extracted from a glass fibre reinforced vinyl ester laminate were immersed in seawater at 35??C for durations of one month and three months. Three-point bend and interlaminar shear strength tests were performed to evaluate the retained flexural strength and interlaminar shear strength of the composite laminates post immersion. After three months of immersion the retained flexural strength and interlaminar shear strength was 90% and 79% respectively, highlighting the potential effect of seawater on the laminate and the importance of accounting for these effects during the design phase.

The biofouling propensity of different materials (polystyrene, borosilicate glass, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified) and coatings (two spray-applied and nanoparticle-based superhydrophobic coatings and a hydrogel-based fouling release coating) was evaluated by means of a short-term protein test, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein, and by the long-term culture of the marine microalga Nannochloropsis gaditana under practical conditions. The results from both methods were similar, confirming that the BSA test predicts microalgal biofouling on surfaces exposed to microalgae cultures whose cells secrete macromolecules, such as proteins, with a high capacity for forming a conditioning film before cell adhesion. The hydrogel-based coating showed significantly reduced BSA and N. gaditana adhesion, whereas the other surfaces failed to control biofouling.

T4BHDSFU,10.1155/2020/5017546,Constitutive Model of Lateral Unloading Creep of Soft Soil under Excess Pore Water Pressure,"Presented in this paper is a study on the lateral unloading creep tests under different excess pore water pressures. The marine sedimentary soft soil in Shenzhen, China, was selected in this study. The results show that the excess pore water pressure plays a significant role in enhancing the unloading creep of soft soil. Higher excess pore water pressure brings more obvious creep deformation of soft soil and lower ultimate failure load. Meanwhile, the viscoelastic and the viscoplastic modulus of soft soil were found to exponentially decline with creep time. A modified merchant model and a combined model of the modified merchant model and plastic elements are used to simulate the viscoelastic and the viscoplastic deformation, respectively. Therefore, a lateral unloading creep model of soft soil is developed based on the modified merchant model. The accuracy and applicability of this model were verified through identifying the parameters in the model. Research results are of particular significance to the numerical simulation of underground space excavation in soft soil areas which considers the effects of excess pore water pressure. ?? 2020 Wei Huang et al.",
D95ZPCLZ,,Integrated simulations for the structural performance of composites,"Fiber-reinforced composites are widely used for structural components in the aircraft, automotive, marine, and other industries due to their low density, high specific stiffness and strength, excellent durability, and design flexibility. During the fabrication of continuous fiber reinforced composite components, fiber direction changes, residual stresses, and out-of-the-mold deformations are unavoidable. As the 2-D fabric is deformed to a 3-D part geometry the fiber tows move, leading to fiber direction changes that result in relative angle changes between the fibers that make up the fabric. These changes have a significant effect on the behavior of the composite material system. The extent of fiber angle change in a non-crimp fabric system is largely dependent on the differences between the 2-D and 3-D geometries and the particular stitching parameters used to manufacture the fabric. In order to better understand the influence of fabrication induced fiber angle change on the performance of structural composite parts, detailed experiments and simulations were conducted. For the experiments, a reinforcement geometry was selected. Due to the complexity of the chosen geometry for draping, several slits were designed at strategic locations to allow the fabric to take the shape without wrinkling. During molding, two patterns were overlaid so that the slit locations after molding were staggered through the thickness to reduce their effect on the structural performance. Detailed draping analyses were performed taking into account the process steps, and the fiber angle changes were calculated using numerical models that were developed previously. Further, the fiber angles following draping were mapped onto the structural performance models used to simulate the crush tests. The predicted stiffness and strength results from the integrated fabrication and performance simulations were compared with the experimental measurements, and the correlations are presented in this paper. These numerical results demonstrate that only integrating the fabrication and structural performance tools can achieve the greater understanding needed for predicting the structural performance of composite materials. ??

Having the most fertile soil in the country, due to a larger share of rainfall and underground water streams from the Hajar mountains, combined with a growing number of resorts taking advantage of Gulf beaches, RAKWA is undertaking a series of major wastewater rehabilitation and expansion projects supporting a population of nearly 420,000 people. Representing over 14.5km of recently installed plastic and fiberglass reinforced pipe, RAKWA targeted its City West Trunk Main, Mairid Network and Force Main Network - Area 1 Project, a currently 'inactive' network, for addition to the city's growing underground wastewater network, requiring innovative condition assessment, prior to its addition to the collection system. RAKWA engineers had noticed numerous sections of the 'new' network were experiencing high levels of infiltration, initially approved by high resolution CCTV cameras. Located on the Arabian Sea, tidal infiltration is a constant threat resulting in infiltration and exfiltration. As a result, prior to connecting lateral services to the network, RAKWA decided to incorporate Focused Electrode Leak Location (FELL) to identify and quantify specific leak locations for Fiberglass UV-Cured Trenchless Rehabilitation. FELL had been recommended in a recent Masterclass by UK-based WRc and is supported by ASTM F2550, leading to RAKWA's decision to use both IBAK Panorama CCTV and FELL technologies. While Gulf authorities have commonly relied on CCTV of their pipes, defects at joints and manhole connections many times have gone unnoticed, adversely affecting network performance. This paper will share results from the first major benchmark of CCTV & FELL technologies in the Gulf and discuss selection parameters to conduct 3.5km of UV-cured CIPP and 310 patches or sectional liners. ?? 37th International NO-DIG Conference and Exhibition 2019.

It is common in many kinds of wet habitats. Common reed is a very tall grass, reaching at best the height of four meters on the coasts of the Baltic Sea. In the wintertime the straw becomes a hard, yellowish stem, which makes it possible to exploit the reed also in construction. Reed beds proliferated quickly in our coastal areas in the late 20th century after pasturage came to its end, due to the nutrient load from air and water, as well as the mild winters. Reed material has been exploited in many ways around the Baltic Sea. For building purposes, reed can be gathered in winter and early spring from the top of ice or other hard surfaces. Reed has been exploited for centuries. It has been used for feeding animals, in bed clothing and in construction. In construction, reed has been used for roof materials and heat insulation. Common reeds with their properties can be used not only for the purposes mentioned above. People are increasingly focusing on sustainable development and the use of natural materials instead of plastics. The reed stem is like a natural pipe. It is already used in the production of cocktail straws. However, there is a much wider range of uses, such as toy components etc. Such applications require that the reed stem is not flattened after cutting. Likewise, the end of the stem must be free of sharp edges and smooth. This article investigates reed cutting using abrasive discs. Cutting speed is important for good quality of cuts. Therefore, different cutting speeds in the experiments are used. The quality of the slice was evaluated using a digital microscope. Cutting power is calculated from the torque and rotation speed. ?? 2020 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies. All rights reserved.",

Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) has become one of the most promising materials among the novel composites due to its low price and high performance. Here, the GFRP composite in investigated by fill atomistic molecular dynamics, which contains the epoxy matrix and amorphous silica substrate. The degradation in chloride environment is revealed through the interfacial interactions, the structural changes of the epoxy matrix and hydrogen bonding in the composites. Compared to dry and aqueous environment, the simulation results show that chloride environment leads to the worst deterioration of interfacial adhesion, which correlates with structural and mechanical degradation of bonded interface, as indicated by the decreased epoxy density close to interface. It is indicated by examining the nano-structures of the interface during the pulling process that the chloride environment hinders the formation of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the GFRP composites. These findings indicate the deterioration towards bond and matrix is critical in the presence of the chloride environment, which provides the fundamental insight for designing and predicting performance degradation of macroscopic GFRP composites in the marine application. ??

IGAGZHU7,,Progressive collapse analysis of stiffened panel structure with consideration of actual welding distortion and residual stresses,"To date, inclusion of welding distortion and residual stresses in determining the strength of marine structures is based on empirical formulations due to welding complexity. In this study, a more feasible numerical model was developed from the perspective of inherent strain theory. The accuracy of this simplified numerical model was confirmed by transient thermo-elastic?€?plastic finite element analysis using a novel dynamic mesh refining and iterative substructure method which is 50 times faster than conventional finite element method. Welding distortion by the two numerical approaches was validated with experimental measurement. The collapse analyses indicated that the inherent strain model predicted a compressive strength and load-displacement curve with high accuracy, as validated by the transient thermo-mechanical model. The global stiffness and the ultimate strength of the welded structure would be overestimated by about 22% if no welding effects were considered. The proposed computation procedure for determining the ultimate strength of welded structures is accurate, simple, and practical and enables improvement of ultimate strength through optimization of welding joint design to reduce the welding residual stress and distortion. ?? 2020 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).",

The transport of gas bubbles in soil and its effects on soil physical and mechanical properties can be further studied. Gas injection and permeability tests were conducted using a self-developed oedometer with gas injection and water infiltration. Before the gas injection test, the remolded saturated soil was consolidated in an oedometer device to an effective vertical stress of 100 kPa. Gas injection tests were then performed to investigate the transport mechanism of bubbles in saturated soil and the changes in water permeability after gas injection. The results show that it is difficult for gas to migrate through capillary invasion and fracturing from the pore scale owing to the high gas entry pressure in fine-grained sediments. Hence, initial gas migration mechanism in pore scale is elastic-plastic expansion. The scale of cavities expands from micron to millimeter during gas injection, and gas pressure for fracturing reduces with the expansion of cavities. The fracturing initiated in millimeter scale and gas invades further into the soil. Interconnections of cavities and cracks resulting in an increasing of drainage rate and coefficient of permeability. ?? 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

A5QH96J7,,"Adapting high strength, corrosion resistant, nanocrystalline materials forapplications in deep-water and hpht hostile environments","It is well understood that strength to weight ratio is an important driver facilitating extended reachdeviated wells, as such engineering corrosion resistant ultra-high-strength light-alloys (LAs) are an absolutenecessity. High strength steels and nickel alloys, having yield strengths between 80 and 120 ksi, commonlyused in oil & gas completions and production, have 3 to 5X higher specific gravity compared to LAs.In comparison, commercial coarse-grained polycrystalline light-alloys (CGP-LAs) have a much lowerstrength, typically less than 45 ksi yield strength and are not corrosion resistant. However, if strength of LAscan be increased to match that of steels and nickel alloys while simultaneously augmenting their corrosionand environmental assisted cracking (EAC) resistance through severe plastic deformation (SPD) routes,manifesting an ultra-fine-grained (UFG) microstructure, they will far surpass strength to weight ratios ofsteels and nickel alloys. As such the quest for a perfect alloy with the right combination of strength, ductility, corrosion, andabrasion resistance is ever ongoing. The advent of nanotechnology and advancements in engineeringnanostructures with high strengths and reasonable ductility has motivated researchers globally [1-7]. Wehave bridged a few of these technology gaps by addressing challenges relating to the compromised ductilityof these novel high-strength nanomaterials, however there is limited data on their EAC susceptibility. EACencompasses stress corrosion cracking (SCC) related events or catastrophic failures due to the loss ofductility of a metal exposed to acid gases, such as hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and/or through absorption ofhydrogen. To determine if grain refinement in a LA, and resultant Hall Petch strengthening, where strength of theUFG-LA surpasses that of commercial coarse-grained oil-grade steels, is instrumental in enhancing its EACresistance, focused experiments were conducted. An aluminum-magnesium CGP-LA commonly used inoffshore and marine applications was selected and subjected to SPD resulting in an UFG microstructure.Both CGP-LA and UFG-LA specimens were exposed to environmental conditions to compare theircorrosion and EAC and resistance. It was observed from polarization measurements and immersion tests that UGF-LA had better corrosionresistance than CGP-LA. Uniaxial tensile tests in a neutral halide environment for various holding times confirmed that strength and ductility was maintained for UFG-LA specimens while catastrophic failuresof CGP-LA specimens were observed. It was also evident from orientation images that grain boundariesin UFG-LA were predominantly high-angle in contrast to CGP-LA. The improved corrosion and EACresistance of UFG-LA was due to a large number of purer grain boundaries with nanocrystalline impuritiesdistributed infrequently along them. These results are very topical as they highlight the possibility of harnessing the enhanced strength toweight ratios of these unique alloys for designing buoyant thin walled flowable shells for deployment inhigh pressure high temperature (HPHT) oilfield environments, from vehicles being designed for interstellargas giants to aggressive sour oilfield reservoirs. ?? 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.",
B8UM47MN,10.1002/btpr.3113,Polyunsaturated fatty acids production by solid-state fermentation on polyurethane foam by Mortierella alpina,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential in healthy diets and their production is extremely important. Natural sources of PUFAs includes animal and aquatic products such as marine fish oil, however there are several limitations such as the decrease of fish stocks throughout the world. Thus, microbial oils are a preferable source of PUFAs. Herein, it was studied the production of PUFAs by Mortierella alpina under solid-state fermentation (SSF) using polyurethane foam as inert substrate and synthetic medium or lignocellulosic hydrolysate as source of C, N, and other nutrients. Several parameters of fermentation conditions were evaluated as carbon source, inductors addition, ratio C/N and temperature. The highest amount of total PUFAs per mass of solid (535.41 ?? 24.12 mg/g), linoleic acid (129.66 ?? 5.84 mg/g), and ??-linoleic acid (401.93 ?? 18.10 mg/g) were produced when the culture medium contained 20 g/L glucose, 10% (w/v) linseed oil, the C/N ratio was adjusted to 25 and the incubation temperature was 25??C for 3 days decreasing to 16??C on the remaining 4 days of fermentation. In addition, a hemicellulosic hydrolysate can be used as low-cost substrate to produce PUFAs, although the production was lower than the achieved with synthetic medium. SSF showed an interesting technology for microbial PUFAs production. ?? 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers",
UWXDS4FI,10.1515/secm-2020-0021,Effects of Elliptical Hole on the Correlation of Natural Frequency with Buckling Load of Basalt Laminates Composite Plates,"Recently, basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) is acknowledged as an outstanding material for the strengthening of existing concrete structure, especially it was being used in marine vehicles, aerospace, automotive and nuclear engineering. Most of the structures were subjected to severe dynamic loading during their service life that may induce vibration of the structures. However, free vibration studied on the basalt laminates composite plates with elliptical cut-out and correlation of natural frequency with buckling load has been very limited. Therefore, effects of the elliptical hole on the natural frequency of basalt/epoxy composite plates was performed in this study. Effects of stacking sequence (??), elliptical hole inclination (??), hole geometric ratio (a/b) and position of the elliptical hole were considered. The numerical modeling of free vibration analysis was based on the mechanical properties of BFRP obtained from the experiment. The natural frequencies as well as mode shapes of basalt laminates composite plates were numerically determined using the commercial program software (ABAQUS). Then, the determination of correlation of natural frequencies with buckling load was carried out. Results showed that elliptical hole inclination and fiber orientation angle induced the inverse proportion between natural frequency and buckling load. ?? 2020 B. Chhorn and W.

TYG9NTTX,10.1155/2020/3713709,Experimental Research on Dynamic Behavior of Circular Mild Steel Plates with Surface Cracks Subjected to Repeated Impacts in Low Temperature,"Experimental investigations on the mechanical responses of fully clamped circular plates with prefabricated crack at room temperature and low temperature have been conducted. Initial cracks with different lengths were prefabricated by the electrical discharge machining method. Low ambient temperature was created by the liquid nitrogen in a low-temperature chamber, and a dropping hammer was dropped from the same height with a constant impact energy of 5 J to carry out the repeated impact. Experimental test results show that the prefabricated crack has a significant influence on the mechanical behavior of the thin plates. The maximum impact force decreases with increase of the crack length, and the threshold impact number until fracture decreases with increase of the crack length. It is also observed from the test results that the maximum impact force increases with decrease of the temperature, while threshold impact number until fracture and the plastic permanent deformation decreases due to the brittleness of the material in low temperature. The present investigations provide useful insight into the failure mechanism of the clamped thin plate with initial crack under low-velocity repeated impacts in low temperature, which will lead to a guideline for research and design of marine structures in the arctic area. ?? 2020 Yang Zeng et al.",

Thus the purpose of the work is analysis of major dependency of the properties on the content of fillers that allowed to revealed the critical filler content (furnace black) in composites to form a protective coating with the required set of characteristics. The infrared (IR) spectral analysis was used to investigate the presence of bonds on the surface of particles of the PM-75 furnace black, which allows us to assess the degree of cross-linking of the polymer. The influence of the content of dispersed furnace black on the physicomechanical and thermophysical properties and the structure of the protective coating is investigated. For the formation of the coating with increased adhesive properties, the optimum content of the additive is q = 25 parts by weight (pts.wt.), due to the increase in the number of C-O, C-C, C=O, C=C, C=O, and O=C-H bonds. For the formation of the coating with increased cohesive properties, the optimum content of the additive is q = 20 pts.wt., which is associated with the maximum compaction of the polymer spatial net. On the basis of the analysis of the surface of the composite fracture, a homogeneous topology of the fracture surface was found which characterizes the viscous state of material destruction at the content of the additive q = 5 pts.wt., which provides significant improvement of the physical and mechanical properties of the materials developed. Additionally, it was found that when the PM-75 particles were introduced at the content of q = 10-30 pts.wt., the uniformity of the structure is retained, but its abnormal similarity is observed. This allowed us to determine the optimal content of the additive (q = 20 pts.wt.) for the formation of coatings with high cohesive strength in the complex. ?? 2020 SAE International",

The complexity of this kind of structure leads structural analysis to be currently performed with numerical tools. This paper presents a nonlinear three-dimensional finite element model of a typical armored Steel Tube Umbilical Cable (STU) subjected to crushing loads imposed to the umbilical cable during laying operation. The study focuses on the analysis of the stress distribution in the steel tubes at caterpillar shoes, mainly at the entry/exit transition regions. With the use of a commercial software, the finite element model is constructed, considering geometric and materials nonlinearities. Crushing loads are imposed by two rigid plates. Focus is given on the duplex tubes, with the material stress-strain curve modeled from a specific crushing experiment with a single tube and by using a classic Ramberg-Osgood fitting. Firstly, comparisons at mid-length of the three-dimensional model are made with the results from a simpler and planar finite element model. Then, the localized three-dimensional effects are analyzed. The results show a considerable increase of the stress levels in the steel tubes at these transition regions, with the occurrence of stress field redistribution after the onset of plastic deformation.

In order to realize the resource utilization of marine biomass, we extract nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) with high aspect ratio from Enteromorpha prolifera. Filamentous NFC is successfully extracted at nanometric scale with a diameters range of 20 40 nm, a length of several microns, and a crystallinity index of 57.2%. Then NFC/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite films were prepared with NFC as fillers. In addition, for comparison, nanocrystals cellulose (NCC) with small aspect ratio was isolated from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) to prepare NCC/PVA composite films. It is shown that because Enteromorpha proliferata NFC has a higher aspect ratio, it is easier to interpenetrate with PVA to form a dense network, and the lower concentration ensures the better dispersion of NFC in the matrix, so its enhancement effect on PVA composite films is better than that of NCC. When the NFC content was 0.1 wt %, the light transmittance of NFC/PVA composite film could reach more than 94%, and the swelling degree was 250%, which is 29% lower than that of the pure PVA film, the water resistance was improved. At the same time, the tensile strength, elastic modulus and toughness were 99.1%, 1547% and 117.9% respectively, which are higher than those of PVA. ?? 2020 Society of Plastics Engineers",

Other processes like top?€?down selection (e.g., predation) may be partially responsible for the unexplained variance. However, top?€?down processes and their interaction with bottom?€?up selective pressures often remain unexplored. We utilised an in situ marine biofilm model system to test the effects of bottom?€?up (i.e., substrate properties) and top?€?down (i.e., large predator exclusion via 100 ??m mesh) selective pressures on community assembly over time (56 days). Prokaryotic and eukaryotic community compositions were monitored using 16 S and 18 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Higher compositional variance was explained by growth substrate in early successional stages, but as biofilms mature, top?€?down predation becomes progressively more important. Wooden substrates promoted heterotrophic growth, whereas inert substrates?€? (i.e., plastic, glass, tile) lack of degradable material selected for autotrophs. Early wood communities contained more mixotrophs and heterotrophs (e.g., the total abundance of Proteobacteria and Euglenozoa was 34% and 41% greater within wood compared to inert substrates). Inert substrates instead showed twice the autotrophic abundance (e.g., cyanobacteria and ochrophyta made up 37% and 10% more of the total abundance within inert substrates than in wood). Late native (non-enclosed) communities were mostly dominated by autotrophs across all substrates, whereas high heterotrophic abundance characterised enclosed communities. Late communities were primarily under top?€?down control, where large predators successively pruned heterotrophs. Integrating a top?€?down control increased explainable variance by 7?€?52%, leading to increased understanding of the underlying ecological processes guiding multitrophic community assembly and successional dynamics. ?? 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Society for Microbial Ecology.",

Due to the complexities in environmental loading conditions, the relevant studies on this topic are limited. In this paper, we collected natural submarine silts from non-liquefied and post-liquefied seabed in the Yellow River subaqueous delta via offshore hydraulic sampling method, respectively. Monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were conducted between them to investigate the re-compaction effect after previous wave-induced liquefaction on the undrained static and cyclic shear behaviours of seabed soil. Our experiments indicated that due to re-compaction process, the static and cyclic strengths of seabed silt in post-liquefied area are both enhanced in comparison to non-liquefied soil. A transformation in static shear failure mode from plastic to brittle after wave-induced liquefaction could be identified in seabed silt. Furthermore, the developments of pore water pressure and cyclic axial strain with number of cycles for seabed silts could be characterized by the hyperbolic and power models, respectively, and an empirical relationship between pore water pressure and cyclic axial strain is proposed for natural seabed silt. Finally, compared with non-liquefied seabed silt, the threshold cyclic stress ratio (CSR) for post-liquefied seabed silt is also elevated due to re-compaction effect. ?? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Additionally, there are a number of challenging crashworthiness criteria set by the regulating authorities in various countries for vehicle safety, which the vehicle has to qualify. In these cases composites can be very useful as they exhibit high strength to weight ratios. But, deformation modes of composites are more complex when compared to metals, due to which it is more important to analyse the behaviour of composites under impact. In this study four types of cross sections (square, cylindrical, hexagonal and decagonal) were considered for the geometric shapes of GFRP (glass fiber reinforced plastic) crash boxes. Drop weight impact testing is widely used for studying the behaviour of parts subjected to impact loadings. The drop weight impact testing is highly dynamic in nature and in addition various factors like data acquisition signal noise (disturbance) requires the user to test 3?€?4 samples for each test specimen, for repeatability and minimisation of errors, which thereby increases the total number of testing samples. Therefore, in practise only a limited number of specimens can be actually tested using drop weight impact test considering the number of specimen samples to be manufactured and the cost involved in it. In this paper the development of numerical simulation model for drop weight impact test and its correlation with the real time drop weight impact testing was discussed in detail. *PART_COMPOSITE model along with *MAT58 material card was used for laminated GFRP composite specimen in Ls-Dyna along with calibration of parameters like longitudinal compression stress limiting factor (SLIMC1) and softness factor (SOFT) for simulation.

In most cases, resistance is only detected after spreading throughout an entire population. Detecting resistance in its incipient stages, by comparison, provides time to implement preventative strategies. Incipient resistance can be detected by coupling standard toxicology assays with large-scale gene expression experiments. We apply this approach to a system where an invasive parasite, sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), has been treated with the highly effective pesticide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) for 60 years. Toxicological experiments revealed that lamprey from treated populations did not have higher survival to TFM exposure than lamprey from untreated populations, demonstrating that full-fledged resistance has not yet evolved. In contrast, we find hundreds of genes differentially expressed in response to TFM in the population with the longest history of exposure, many of which relate to TFM?€?s primary mode of action, the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and subsequent depletion of ATP. Three genes critical to oxidative phosphorylation, ATP5PB, PLCB1, and NDUFA9, were nearly fixed for alternative alleles in comparisons of SNPs between treated and untreated populations (FST &gt; 5 SD from the mean). ATP5PB encodes subunit b of ATP synthase and an additional subunit, ATP5F1B, was canalized for high expression in treated populations, but remained plastic in response to TFM treatment in individuals from the untreated population. These combined genomic and transcriptomic results demonstrate that an adaptive, genetic response to TFM is likely driving incipient resistance in a damaging pest species. ?? 2020 The Authors.

Meanwhile, a simple and effective strategy was designed to achieve rapidly reconfigurable shape fixity and shape recovery for a heat-triggered shape-memory polymer (HSMP), which was derived from a typical sea-island structured EAA/CR TPVs. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) showed the average diameter of CR particles in EAA/CR TPVs was 3 8 ??m. In this work, the mechanical properties results showed that the EAA/CR TPV had high tensile strength, indicating a strong interface interaction between EAA and CR, which would inevitably improve the shape recovery (SR) and shape fixing (SF) ability of TPVs. This HSMP exhibited the surprising shape-memory property (shape fixity ratio 97%, shape recovery ratio 95%, and fast recovery speed <30 s). The dynamic mechanical behavior and stress relaxation behavior of EAA/CR TPVs were characterized, and the results demonstrated that the high modulus value supported the improvement of SF ratios, and with the decrease continuously of EAA in the EAA/CR TPVs, the low-stress relaxation ratio stimulated the improvement of SR ratios of the EAA/CR TPVs. This novel HSMP expected to open up a wide range of potential applications in smart devices. ?? BME-PT.",

Due to the lack of the numerical simulation method which could describe the dynamic characteristics of the saturated soft clay under seismic loading, few researches are reported on the dynamic sliding process of submarine slope in saturated cohesive soil deposits. Adopting the subroutine interface technology provided by ABAQUS platform, the undrained cyclic elastoplastic constitutive model, which could describe the dynamic characteristics of saturated soft clay, is programmed into user-defined material subroutine VUMAT and embedded in display dynamics analysis module of ABAQUS platform. Based on the cyclic elastic-plastic constitutive model and the updated Lagrangian technology, a numerical simulation method is proposed to investigate the dynamic sliding process of submarine soft clay slope under seismic loading. The applicability of the proposed numerical simulation method is verified by comparing with the previous research results. The results show that the strain accumulation characteristic makes the final accumulated deformation and shear strain larger than that of the conventional numerical modeling methods. When the general static constitutive model is used for dynamic analysis of slope, the analysis results are not conservative because the strain accumulation characteristic cannot be considered. Besides, it can display the whole dynamic sliding process of the slope, more intuitively predict the slope topography before and after earthquake, which could provide a reference for the planning and design of offshore structures. ?? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",
UUAIUVHB,,An investigation of residual hydroelastic response of a 3D printed propeller at low reynolds numbers,"The structure of the boundary layer developed on ship propeller blades is significantly influenced by the Reynolds number. The propeller flow regime will determine the radial distribution of vorticity and shear stress within the boundary layer and ultimately, the hydrodynamic loading exerted by the moving fluid particles on the blades. Therefore, when performing propeller model tests, it is desirable to perform the tests at the largest possible Reynolds number to reduce scale effects. The challenge of achieving the highest possible Reynolds number is exacerbated when a 3D printed model from UV curable plastic or resins in utilized since the tensile strength of 3D printed model propellers is in general an order of magnitude lower than full scale NiBrAl casting alloys. In this condition, the Reynolds number can be limited by the maximum hydrodynamic loading on the blades before failure. At high enough Reynolds numbers (Re = 5 ?? 105) the loads on the model propeller are large enough to cause a residual dynamic bending and twisting response of the model propeller blades. It is believed that this response leads to a discrepancy in the propulsive coefficients when compared to the baseline Wageningen reference propeller (Re = 2 ?? 106). This study aims to quantify the effect of the dynamic response on the measured propulsive coefficients using a 2-way coupled RANSE CFD-FSI solver, such that the true interaction between the fluid flow and the structural response of the propeller blades is captured using an adequate boundary layer model.

VNH4KW6D,10.1117/12.2565788,Experimental verification of a self-excited power generation system for dielectric elastomer generation using piezoelectric elements,"Dielectric elastomer generation is a power generation method that converts various mechanical energies into electric energy by using a dielectric elastomer. Dielectric elastomer generation can harvest electric energy from renewable energy sources such as sea wave power, hydraulic power (Karman vortex), and wind power. Practical application of dielectric elastomer generation faces various issues; however, this paper will focus on an electrical problem of a dielectric elastomer generation circuit. The dielectric elastomer generation circuit needs an external power supply to charge the dielectric elastomer before starting the electric generation. Additionally, the dielectric elastomer generation circuit requires a high DC voltage. In this paper, we propose a self-excited dielectric elastomer generation circuit using piezoelectric elements. The proposed circuit consists of piezoelectric elements, the Cockcroft-Walton circuit, the dielectric elastomer, and the ringing choke converter. In the proposed circuit, the piezoelectric element is vibrated to generate a voltage, and the generated voltage is boosted to a high voltage value for charging the dielectric elastomer by the Cockcroft-Walton circuit. After the dielectric elastomer generation is completed, the ringing choke converter circuit steps down the generated voltage to a predetermined value, and the generated power is the output to a load. Furthermore, operations of the circuit are confirmed by the simulation and experimental results. The experimental results are obtained by using a test bench. The test bench uses a piston machine driven by a DC motor for the purpose of stretching and shrinking the dielectric elastomer. ?? 2020 SPIE.",

We investigated the effects of gamma irradiation at 0.5 - 20 kGy on the concentration of four antioxidants: Tris (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite, octadecyl 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, pentaerythritol tetrakis [3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate] and tris(nonylphenyl) phosphite; a slip agent (erucamide); and four antioxidant radiolysis products: Tris (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, tris(nonylphenyl) phosphate, and nonylphenol in polyethylene resin. Using accelerated solvent extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we found the concentration of antioxidants decreased as the irradiation dose increased. As the irradiation dose increased to 4 kGy, the major products associated with irradiation treatment increased. Erucamide was not significantly affected at doses less than 20 kGy. The results presented in this paper can assist with the safety evaluations of food packaging materials. ?? 2019",
UTAXM8ZC,10.1016/j.aaf.2020.08.008,Use of sewage in split doses to enhance water productivity for fish culture,"The problem of sewage disposal has received great attention worldwide. The raw sewage contains a variety of high inorganic and organic matters that affect natural water environment. To mitigate such problem, sewage may be recycled through aquaculture practice. Sewage recycling in aquaculture enhances water productivity through nutrients input. Proper loading of sewage ensures viable aquaculture; otherwise, fish mortality occurs due to poor water quality. To optimize sewage application, two different experiments were conducted, each with four treatments. In both experiments, three fish species namely rohu (Labeo rohita Hamilton, 1822), mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala Hamilton, 1822), and bata (Labeo bata Hamilton, 1822) were tested in triplicate in FRP (Fibre-Reinforced Plastic) tanks. Different sewage concentrations (0, 25%, 50% and 75%) used in first experiment were prepared by mixing freshwater, showing Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) 2.0 ?? 0.4 mg/L, 10.8 ?? 1.4 mg/L, 19.6 ?? 1.5 mg/L and 41.6 ?? 2.58 mg/L, respectively. After 30 days rearing, results showed ???75% fish survival in sewage concentrations up to 50% with BOD level 19.6 ?? 1.5 mg/L. Less than 50% fish survived in 75% sewage concentration, with BOD level as 41.6 ?? 2.58 mg/L. The second experiment was conducted for 90 days considering 50% sewage concentration as basal dose with BOD level as 19.6 mg/L as an acceptable limit for fish survival. Split doses of sewage were applied in T1, T2 and T3 treatments fortnightly, weekly and semi-weekly intervals, while single dose was used in C (control) treatment. Application of split doses resulted better hydro-biological changes, including nutrients recovery, in T1, T2 and T3 than that of single dose in control. Fish growth plotted with net primary productivity (NPP), phytoplankton and zooplankton densities exhibited positive correlations in T2 (12 doses) and T3 (24 doses), considered as optimal doses to ensure better water productivity for desirable fish production than sewage with single dose or limited doses (6 doses). ?? 2020 Shanghai Ocean University",
HAMWIBB2,10.3390/ma13010234,Study on the flexural performance of hybrid-reinforced concrete beams with a new cathodic protection system subjected to corrosion,"Steel corrosion is considered as the main factor for the insufficient durability of concrete structures, especially in the marine environment. In this paper, to further inhibit steel corrosion in a high chloride environment and take advantage of the dual-functional carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), the impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) technique was applied to the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam with internally embedded CFRP bars and steel fiber reinforced polymer composite bar (SFCB) as the anode material while the steel bar was compelled to the cathode. The effect of the new ICCP system on the flexural performance of the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam subjected to corrosion was verified experimentally. First, the electricity-accelerated precorrosion test was performed for the steel bar in the hybrid-reinforced beams with a target corrosion ratio of 5%. Then, the dry-wet cycles corrosion was conducted and the ICCP system was activated simultaneously for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam for 180 days. Finally, the three-point bending experiment was carried out for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beams. The steel bars were taken out from the concrete to quantitatively measure the corrosion ratio after flexural tests. Results showed that the further corrosion of steel bars could be inhibited effectively by the ICCP treatment with the CFRP bar and the SFCB as the anode. Additionally, the ICCP system showed an obvious effect on the flexural behavior of the hybrid-reinforced concrete beams: The crack load and ultimate load, as well as the stiffness, were enhanced notably compared with the beam without ICCP treatment. Compared with the SFCB anode, the ICCP system with the CFRP bar as the anode material was more effective for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam to prevent the steel corrosion. ?? 2019 by the authors.",
Q8HH3PIF,,Understanding post-impact compressive/ bending performance of composites using linear elastic fracture mechanics model,"In this study, we employ the use of a linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) model to understand and predict the post-impact performance of composites. Compressive-after-impact (CAI) and bending-after-impact (BAI) strength of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites are important design considerations in the aerospace industry. Although CFRP composites are light-weight and high-strength, their susceptibility to impact results in barely visible impact damage (BVID), consisting of complex damage modes (matric cracking, delamination, fiber breakage, etc.) often hidden beneath the surface of the composite material. BVID subsequently leads to drastic reduction in CAI and BAI strength. We utilize a LEFM model to understand how impact damage affects post-impact performance. In particular, we study how impact damage depth (d), damage width (l) and impact-induced delamination (a) affects brittle fracture of composites during compressive and flexural loading. Strain energy release rate (SERR) is calculated to predict crack growth based on fracture mechanics. Results show that increasing damage depth (d) results in higher SERR. Moreover, decreasing undamaged depth, h, also causes higher SERR, thereby resulting in CAI brittle fracture. Interestingly, when the total depth is kept constant, an exponential increase in SERR is evident when damage depth reaches around 60% of total depth. Results in the analytical models are compared to experimental results of CAI and BAI tests of CFRP composite foam-core sandwich structures, with the aim to study the influence of low temperature Arctic conditions. The motivation of this study is fueled by the recent global trend to explore the Arctic region due to greater accessibility to the area, as new sea routes are opened as a result of Arctic ice melting. Our study demonstrates a significant influence of low temperature on impact behavior and post-impact performance. ?? ASC 2020.",

Confined compressive strength testing of chalk from a North Sea reservoir was done in water-saturated and oil-saturated conditions. During testing, elastic wave velocities were sampled by ultrasonic transducers, so that subsequently Biot's coefficient could be modelled. The porosity declined via an ?€?elastic phase?€?, a ?€?transitional phase?€?, an ?€?elastoplastic phase?€? and a ?€?strain hardening phase?€?, but Biot's coefficient indicates that these terms may be partly misleading. In the ?€?elastic phase?€?, porosity and Biot's coefficient decrease, indicating elastoplastic deformation. In the ?€?transitional phase?€?, Biot's coefficient increases as a reflection of breaking contact cement (pore collapse), whereas Biot's coefficient remains stable in the ?€?elastoplastic phase?€?, indicating elastic deformation on the virgin curve. Plastic deformation takes place during phases of creep, where both porosity and Biot's coefficient decrease. Similarly, in the ?€?strain hardening phase?€?, both porosity and Biot's coefficient decrease as a reflection of elastoplastic deformation. For chalk with 45%?€?47% porosity, the ?€?transitional phase?€? begins at 8 MPa axial stress when water-saturated and at 12 MPa when oil-saturated. For chalk with 41%?€?43% porosity, the corresponding stresses are 16 and 20 MPa. For chalk with 32%?€?36% porosity, the corresponding stresses are 23 and 31 MPa. Chalk samples with irreducible water saturation and movable oil were water-flooded. They yield at stresses close to corresponding oil-saturated samples, but after flooding show compaction trends not significantly different from the water-saturated samples. Water-flooding promotes pore collapse as reflected in an increasing Biot's coefficient. The consequent softening effect on acoustic impedance is small as compared with the effect of increasing fluid density. With respect to 4D seismic, water-flooding causes distinctly higher acoustic impedance and Poisson's ratio irrespective of compaction. ?? 2020 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers",
I2D84F64,10.1115/OMAE2020-18046,Effects of thickness and winding angle of the laminate on internal pressure capacity of thermoplastic composite pipes,"Thermoplastic composite pipes (TCPs) are increasingly used to transport hydrocarbons and water in the oil and gas industry due to their superior properties including corrosion resistance, thermal insulation, light weight, etc. The cross-section of TCPs generally consists of three layers: inner liner, composite laminate, and outer jacket. Three layers are bonded together and form a solid-wall construction. Inner liner and outer jacket made of thermoplastic polymer provide protective barriers for the laminate to against the inner fluid and outer environment. The laminate is constructed by an even number of helically wounded continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite tapes. In this study, mechanical behaviors of a TCP under an internal pressure were investigated by using analytical and finite element analysis (FEA) methods. The analytical method which is based on the three-dimensional (3D) anisotropy elastic theory can take account of non-uniformly distributed stress and strain through the thickness of the pipe wall. FEA models were setup by using the software ABAQUS to predict the stress distribution of the pipe. 3D Tsai-Wu failure criterion was used to predict the maximum internal pressure of the pipe. Effects of some critical parameters, such as the winding angle of composite tapes and the number of reinforced plies, on the internal pressure capacity of TCPs were studied. Results obtained from the analytical and FEA methods were fairly agreed with each other, which showed that with the increasing of the number of reinforced plies the internal pressure capacity of a TCP gradually increases and approaches to an extreme value. In addition, the optimal winding angle which results the maximum internal pressure is not a constant value, instead, it varies with the increasing thickness of the laminate layer. This study provides useful tools and guidance for the design and analysis of TCPs, and is currently under validation through experiments. Copyright ?? 2020 ASME.",
2ILP6PAQ,10.1115/OMAE2020-18047,Numerical evaluation on lateral impact resistance of thermoplastic composite pipes in terms of internal pressure capacity,"Subsea pipelines are prone to be damaged by the falling objects from ships or offshore platforms, which may result in economic losses and pollution. The dimensions of dent were commonly used to evaluate the impact resistance of pipes made from carbon steel. Thermoplastic composite pipes (TCPs), due to their superior properties including corrosion resistance, thermal insulation, fast installation, etc., are increasingly used as the subsea pipelines. The TCP is made from thermoplastic resins and reinforced by continuous fibers. Because of the brittle nature of carbon fibers and glass fibers, the dimensions of dent are not suitable for assessment of impact resistance of a TCP. In the present work, a procedure was proposed using the internal pressure capacity as an indicator to evaluate the lateral impact resistance of a TCP. First, the internal pressure capacity of an intact TCP was evaluated. Second, a quasi-static simulation was conducted by applying a lateral compression force on the intact TCP using a rigid ball, until one of the composite plies in the reinforcement layer failed. The quasi-static simulation provided an initial estimate of the minimum energy that causes the start of damage of the TCP. Third, the impact simulations were performed by using a rigid ball hitting the TCP and, then, the internal pressure capacity of the damaged TCP was evaluated. Finally, the internal pressure capacity of the damaged pipe, compared with that of the intact pipe, was used as an indicator to evaluate the lateral impact resistance of the TCP. In this study, a glass-fiber reinforced polyethylene (PE) pipe of an inner diameter of 150 mm was modeled by ABAQUS to illustrate the procedure. A theoretical method was proposed to calculate the impact energy of a dropped object in a shallow water. The example studied in the present work showed that the modeled TCP was not strong enough to survive the lateral impact caused by the dropped object and should be buried to a certain depth beneath the seabed if used as a subsea pipeline.

X5D5IKC8,,Elucidating the impact of microbial interactions on fiber-reinforced polymer composites,"Fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRPC), especially vinyl ester-based polymer composites, have become an attractive option for lightweight structural applications due to their excellent moisture-resistance properties. Degradation of FRPCs due to environmental factors such as moisture and temperature are well studied and recognized in the literature. Di-ionized (DI) water and synthetic seawater have been primarily considered to evaluate polymer composite degradation. Little to no attention has been paid to microbes present in natural environments, and their interactions with polymer composites that can potentially aggravate degradation. A few investigations have explored specific fungus or microbial environment to understand their effects on polymer composite degradation. However, no previous study has explored the influence of naturally occurring diverse microbial communities in the environment, such as soil or marine waters, on the performance of polymer composites. Therefore, in this study, we elucidate microbial induced damage on polymer composite materials from naturally occurring diverse microbial communities in natural soil, and further establish their impact on the physical and structural integrity of these composites. Due to the diverse nature of the microbial community, the observations and conclusions from this study can be extended to other natural environments. Carbon fiber reinforced vinyl ester composites were subjected to DI water, autoclaved and ad received soil water for up to 20 weeks. We periodically measured their nanomechanical (nanoindentation) and thermal properties (Thermogravimetric analysis), which showed a reduction these properties in the presence of microbes. Reduction in thermal properties indicated polymer chain scission in composite samples, which was related to hydrogen bond formation through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. Reduction in the amount of dissolved organic carbon content in soil water with time indicated the consumption of carbon by microbes. Additionally, analyzing the biofilms grown on polymer composite samples using metagenomics in collaboration with microbiologists, we confirmed microbial growth. In summary, an in-depth study was conducted to elucidate degradation mechanisms of polymer composites due to microbial activity. ?? ASC 2020.",

Nowadays importance has been given to study on both PET and PMMA due to their growing demand in building Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENG) to replace small batteries. The manufacturing of both triboelectric polymers from raw materials is hazardous to the environment. However, there has been no comparative evaluation of the probable effects of PET and PMMA production plants yet. This study highlights their comparative eco-profiles. An inclusive Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) model is built for methodical assessment of their impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been done by the ILCD midpoint method, Eco-indicator 99 endpoint method, Raw Material Flow (RMF) method, Greenhouse gas protocol method, and Ecopoints 97 method utilizing the Ecoinvent database and SimaPro software. The effects are assessed and compared for 21 impact categories such as global warming, acidification, eutrophication, terrestrial ecotoxicity, human toxicity, human carcinogenic toxicity, and fine particulate matter formation, marine ecotoxicity etc. The results indicate an estimated 3.01 kg CO2 eq./kg and 8.43 kg CO2 eq./kg of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission to the environment by a PET plant and a PMMA plant, respectively. Moreover, PET plants have the highest effect on land use, ionizing radiation and ozone depletion; whereas PMMA plants have the greatest impact on climate change, acidification, eutrophication and resources. Overall, PMMA polymer production plants are found to be more hazardous to the environment than PET polymer production plants. It is recommended that a better environmental profile from both types of production plants can be achieved through optimization, via abating the effects by replacing the problematic materials, designs, methods and devices with their equivalent environment-friendly options without compromising the quality and production rates. ?? 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",
DNDGVS63,10.1115/OMAE2020-18450,Effect of pre-strain on bending strain capacity of mechanically lined pipe,"The high demand for subsea transportation of corrosive wellhead produced fluids has created interest in economical mechanically lined pipes (MLP) made of external carbon steel and a thin internal layer of corrosion resistant alloy (CRA). The bending strain capacity of an MLP, where a CRA liner is adhered to a carbon steel host pipe by means of an interference fit, is often governed by the liner wrinkling limit state. Although the strain capacity of the MLP with a typical 3 mm thick liner is enough to withstand bending to strains encountered during installation with the S-lay or J-lay method, the liner is at risk of wrinkling when the MLP is subjected to higher bending strains during reellay. To allow reeled installation, the liner strain capacity is enhanced by either increasing the liner thickness or pressurizing the MLP during installation. In the former approach, the required liner thickness is proportional to the pipe diameter. For larger diameter MLPs, it is therefore often more economical to select a 3 mm thick liner and flood and pressurize an MLP to ensure liner stability during reeling. However, the MLP may need to be depressurized and partially drained during installation to allow welding a structure, performing reel-to-reel connection or pipeline recovery which impose bending strain on a plastically prestrained and depressurized pipeline. Furthermore, reeled pipelines may be depressurized subsea while subjected to bending loads from operation. Although there is a history of research into the limit loads and failure modes of MLPs, there is still no comprehensive guidance on determining the risk of liner wrinkling in plastically pre-strained MLPs. In this paper, an approach is proposed for evaluating the strain capacity and assessing the risk of liner wrinkling after an MLP, subjected to plastic bending during reeled installation at elevated pressure, is depressurized and subjected to installation loads during offshore intervention or operational loading in service. The combined effect of strain history at elevated pressure, reeling-induced ovality, bending direction after depressurization, differential pressure, temperature and residual strain is discussed. The recommendations for further work are also given. Copyright ?? 2020 ASME.",
MM7T4HHM,,Thermoplastic composite pipes: A reliable cost-effective solution for pre-salt,"Thermoplastic Composite Pipe (TCP) has a solid wall construction constituted from a single polymer material with embedded (melt-fused) fibre reinforcements. It is a disruptive technology where all the advantages for ultra-deep water developments come together: high strength, light weight, corrosion free, low CAPEX, etc. TCP is therefore one of the most promising solutions to overcome the recent failures found on pre-salt fields related to corrosion under high concentrations of H2S and CO2. However, introducing a new technology on very challenging applications such as deep water production risers, requires careful consideration and mitigation of all technical and project execution risks. This paper starts presenting a historical review of some of the new technologies applied offshore Brazil over the last 20 years making a parallel with the increasing acceptance of Thermoplastic Composite Pipe in the Brazilian market. Following the historical review, TCP technology is presented and strategy to enable free hanging catenary systems for ultra-deep water environments discussed. The basis of the study is a typical offshore Brazil pre-salt field and feasibility of 6"" and 8"" free hanging TCP risers were assessed. Study was performed in close cooperation with a major operator and an installation contractor in Brazil. Global, installation and local analyses of the TCP Riser system have shown the feasibility of installation as well as operations in a free hanging catenary configuration throughout the 30 years' service life. In 2017, this pre-FEED study was used as basis for a FMECA (Failure mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis). The FMECA exercise was carried out together with a third-party certification body and two major Oil &amp; Gas companies very active in Brazil. A detailed business case study was performed in order to quantify the potential CAPEX savings that TCP technology can bring compared to the low lazy wave systems currently installed in pre-salt fields, offshore Brazil. Result is that if TCP is adopted as primary technology for Risers&amp;Flowlines, significant savings are expected. Savings comes both from pipe and ancillary's procurement costs since TCP technology enables free hanging catenary configuration, avoiding purchase of expensive buoyancy modules. The outcome of this work lead to a qualification program currently being sponsored by one major operator active in Brazil. Technology Roadmap was established in phases being the ultimate goal the qualification of pre-salt 8.0in production lines. Reasons for adopting this qualification strategy is presented. The qualification is driven by DNV-ST-F-119, a dedicated standard for TCP design and qualification. ?? 2019, Offshore Technology Conference",
BS5WWQ7Q,10.1117/12.2574082,Experimental study of wave damping due to ice floes in application to radar remote sensing of the marginal ice zone,"Remote sensing of wind waves propagating in the areas covered by ice at initial stages of its formation in the marginal ice zone using radar is an urging problem for mapping ice boundaries and their dynamics. Another aspect of the problem is to investigate possibilities of discrimination between the marginal ice zone and oil spills in radar imagery. This study is focused on modeling the damping of surface waves due to ice floes in laboratory and field experiment. Laboratory experiments were carried out is a container filled with pure water in order to exclude the effect of surfactant films on wave damping. The container was mounted on a vibration table, so that surface gravity-capillary waves (GCW) could be parametrically generated in the container when the amplitude of the vibrations exceeded some threshold level. The wave damping coefficient could be retrieved when measuring the threshold. The floes in experiment were modeled using thin plastic pieces of two different sizes, the relative square of the ""floe""coverage of the water surface was controlled in experiment. The dependences of the damping coefficient at different relations between the surface wavelength and the floe dimensions as functions of the floe coverage area were obtained. It is obtained that the damping of gravity-capillary waves in the presence of floes comparable in size with GCW can be one to two orders of magnitude greater that the wave damping due to inextensible film. Preliminary field experiments have been conducted on the Gorky Water Reservoir using a research catamaran vessel of the Institute of Applied Physics. Plywood pieces with sizes several times smaller that the studied surface wavelengths were used as imitators of ice floes and were deployed in between the catamaran hulls. Surface waves propagating between the halls were generated mechanically by a vertically oscillating motor boat. The amplitude of attenuating surface waves due to the ""plywood floes""was measured with wire gauges mounted at the bow and the stern of the catamaran. The damping distance due to ice floes obtained in the field experiment was estimated as about 10 wavelengths thus indicating that that wave suppression due to the floes was essentially stronger than the viscous wave damping for clean or contaminated water surface. Wave damping observed both in the laboratory and field experiments can be comparable with the wave damping due to crude oil/oil emulsion films, so the problem of discrimination between, e.g. grease ice and oil spills in radar imagery can be nontrivial. ??
