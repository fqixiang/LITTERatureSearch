# LITTERatureSearch
Repository for our work on the CCSS Complexaton Challenge 5: Trawling through the rubbish: Data mining of the scientific literature on marine plastic pollution.

# Tips
See the `complexaton5_kickoff.pdf` for general information about the challenge.

# Frist Step
Find below some information about the kind of relevant and irrelevant literature this project is concerned with.

## Relevant (and where to find the data)
* Tanhua T, Gutekunst SB, Biastoch A (2020) A near-synoptic survey of ocean microplastic concentration along an around-the-world sailing race. (Data Availability Statement -> Original dataset download link-> FullTrajectory Excel)

* Suaria et al. (2020)  Floating macro- and microplastics around the Southern Ocean: Results from the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition. (Supplementary Material -> Supplementary data 2.-> Table S1)

* Löder et al. (2017) Enzymatic Purification of Microplastics in Environmental Samples. (Sampling stations in Supplementary material Table S1 and plastic concentrations in Table 2 in Paper.)

* Rochman et al. (2014) Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in fish tissue may be an indicator of plastic contamination in marine habitats. (Supplementary PDF - Table 1)

Notes: Please note that the dataset will not be present in the paper most likely. However, such papers will have figures representing concentrations or abundances. It might help to look for terms like "measured abundance/ concentration” in figure captions or Materials and Methods section and then proceed towards dataset links.

Other interesting place to check might be Highlights/ Key points available at the beginning of the paper.

This part will be quite challenging as the authors will make the data available in different formats: In PDF, online repositories, etc. or may not even make the data available. I will try to send some more papers soon where data is made available in a different way than in the above papers.



## Irrelevant
* Wichmann et al. (2020) Mixing of passive tracers at the ocean surface and its implications for plastic transport modelling.
* Kara Lavender Law (2017) Plastics in the Marine Environment. 

Notes: Such papers may contain figures of plastic concentrations (reference other papers) but not the raw data.
