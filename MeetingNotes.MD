# Kick-off Meeting 20201222

## The ultimate goal (not of relevance to the current challenge)
* A 3d map of plastics in the ocean
* Eventually a virtual simulation of how plastics move
* Need as many observations of plastics as possible (to train the model)

## Pre-existing work
* 2 master students going through literature manually
* The goal of the challenge is scraping of the literature
* There is a small database of the Mediterranean ocean now - curated data set ready by mid January


## Main challenges
* How to automatically identify peer-reviewed papers that contain data on observations of plastic in the ocean and on beaches>
* How to automatically parse that data into a database?
* How to geo-tag the plastic observations to location and time of sampling?

## Tips

* Start with challenge 1: identify relevant papers and if possible, automate extraction of the data sets
* Start with more recent papers: look for data availability statement
* We can get some expected meta data from Darshika.
* Darshika is first point of contact for any questions

## To Do:

- [x]  Make a meeting on Jan. 8
- [x]  Ask for a couple of papers
- [ ]  Start with Challenge 1
- [ ]  Expect meta data afrom Darshika
